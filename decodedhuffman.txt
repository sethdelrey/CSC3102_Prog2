be anything but a detailed account of the november revolution  when the bolsheviki  at the head of the workers and soldiers  seized the state power of russia and placed it in the hands of the soviets   naturally most of it deals with  red petrograd   the capital and heart of the insurrection  but the reader must realize that what took place in petrograd was almost exactly duplicated  with greater or lesser intensity  at different intervals of time  all over russia   in this book  the first of several which i am writing  i must confine myself to a chronicle of those events which i myself observed and experienced  and those supported by reliable evidence  preceded by two chapters briefly outlining the background and causes of the november revolution  i am aware that these two chapters make difficult reading  but they are essential to an understanding of what follows   many questions will suggest themselves to the mind of the reader  what is bolshevism  what kind of a governmental structure did the bolsheviki set up  if the bolsheviki championed the constituent assembly before the november revolution  why did they disperse it by force of arms afterward  and if the bourgeoisie opposed the constituent assembly until the danger of bolshevism became apparent  why did they champion it afterward   these and many other questions cannot be answered here  in another volume   kornilov to brest litovsk   i trace the course of the revolution up to and including the german  peace  there i explain the origin and functions of the revolutionary organisations  the evolution of popular sentiment  the dissolution of the constituent assembly  the structure of the soviet state  and the course and outcome of the brest  litovsk negotiations    in considering the rise of the bolsheviki it is necessary to understand that russian economic life and the russian army were not disorganised on november 7th  1917  but many months before  as the logical result of a process which began as far back as 1915  the corrupt reactionaries in control of the tsar s court deliberately undertook to wreck russia in order to make a separate peace with germany  the lack of arms on the front  which had caused the great retreat of the summer of 1915  the lack of food in the army and in the great cities  the break down of manufactures and transportation in 1916 all these we know now were part of a gigantic campaign of sabotage  this was halted just in time by the march revolution   for the first few months of the new r gime  in spite of the confusion incident upon a great revolution  when one hundred and sixty millions of the world s most oppressed peoples suddenly achieved liberty  both the internal situation and the combative power of the army actually improved   but the  honeymoon  was short  the propertied classes wanted merely a political revolution  which would take the power from the tsar and give it to them  they wanted russia to be a constitutional republic  like france or the united states  or a constitutional monarchy  like england  on the other hand  the masses of the people wanted real industrial and agrarian democracy   william english walling  in his book   russia s message   an account of the revolution of 1905  describes very well the state of mind of the russian workers  who were later to support bolshevism almost unanimously   they  the working people  saw it was possible that even under a free government  if it fell into the hands of other social classes  they might still continue to starve    the russian workman is revolutionary  but he is neither violent  dogmatic  nor unintelligent  he is ready for barricades  but he has studied them  and alone of the workers of the world he has learned about them from actual experience  he is ready and willing to fight his oppressor  the capitalist class  to a finish  but he does not ignore the existence of other classes  he merely asks that the other classes take one side or the other in the bitter conflict that draws near    they  the workers  were all agreed that our  american  political institutions were preferable to their own  but they were not very anxious to exchange one despot for another  i e   the capitalist class     the workingmen of russia did not have themselves shot down  executed by hundreds in moscow  riga and odessa  imprisoned by thousands in every russian jail  and exiled to the deserts and the arctic regions  in exchange for the doubtful privileges of the workingmen of goldfields and cripple creek    and so developed in russia  in the midst of a foreign war  the social revolution on top of the political revolution  culminating in the triumph of bolshevism   mr  a  j  sack  director in this country of the russian information bureau  which opposes the soviet government  has this to say in his book   the birth of the russian democracy   the bolsheviks organised their own cabinet  with nicholas lenine as premier and leon trotsky  minister of foreign affairs  the inevitability of their coming into power became evident almost immediately after the march revolution  the history of the bolsheviki  after the revolution  is a history of their steady growth    foreigners  and americans especially  frequently emphasise the  ignorance  of the russian workers  it is true they lacked the political experience of the peoples of the west  but they were very well trained in voluntary organisation  in 1917 there were more than twelve million members of the russian consumers  cooperative societies  and the soviets themselves are a wonderful demonstration of their organising genius  moreover  there is probably not a people in the world so well educated in socialist theory and its practical application   william english walling thus characterises them   the russian working people are for the most part able to read and write  for many years the country has been in such a disturbed condition that they have had the advantage of leadership not only of intelligent individuals in their midst  but of a large part of the equally revolutionary educated class  who have turned to the working people with their ideas for the political and social regeneration of russia    many writers explain their hostility to the soviet government by arguing that the last phase of the russian revolution was simply a struggle of the  respectable  elements against the brutal attacks of bolshevism  however  it was the propertied classes  who  when they realised the growth in power of the popular revolutionary organisations  undertook to destroy them and to halt the revolution  to this end the propertied classes finally resorted to desperate measures  in order to wreck the kerensky ministry and the soviets  transportation was disorganised and internal troubles provoked  to crush the factory  shop committees  plants were shut down  and fuel and raw materials diverted  to break the army committees at the front  capital punishment was restored and military defeat connived at   this was all excellent fuel for the bolshevik fire  the bolsheviki retorted by preaching the class war  and by asserting the supremacy of the soviets   between these two extremes  with the other factions which whole  heartedly or half heartedly supported them  were the so called  moderate  socialists  the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries  and several smaller parties  these groups were also attacked by the propertied classes  but their power of resistance was crippled by their theories   roughly  the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries believed that russia was not economically ripe for a social revolution that only a  political  revolution was possible  according to their interpretation  the russian masses were not educated enough to take over the power  any attempt to do so would inevitably bring on a reaction  by means of which some ruthless opportunist might restore the old r gime  and so it followed that when the  moderate  socialists were forced to assume the power  they were afraid to use it   they believed that russia must pass through the stages of political and economic development known to western europe  and emerge at last  with the rest of the world  into full fledged socialism  naturally  therefore  they agreed with the propertied classes that russia must first be a parliamentary state though with some improvements on the western democracies  as a consequence  they insisted upon the collaboration of the propertied classes in the government   from this it was an easy step to supporting them  the  moderate  socialists needed the bourgeoisie  but the bourgeoisie did not need the  moderate  socialists  so it resulted in the socialist ministers being obliged to give way  little by little  on their entire program  while the propertied classes grew more and more insistent   and at the end  when the bolsheviki upset the whole hollow compromise  the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries found themselves fighting on the side of the propertied classes   in almost every country in the world to day the same phenomenon is visible   instead of being a destructive force  it seems to me that the bolsheviki were the only party in russia with a constructive program and the power to impose it on the country  if they had not succeeded to the government when they did  there is little doubt in my mind that the armies of imperial germany would have been in petrograd and moscow in december  and russia would again be ridden by a tsar    it is still fashionable  after a whole year of the soviet government  to speak of the bolshevik insurrection as an  adventure   adventure it was  and one of the most marvellous mankind ever embarked upon  sweeping into history at the head of the toiling masses  and staking everything on their vast and simple desires  already the machinery had been set up by which the land of the great estates could be distributed among the peasants  the factory shop committees and the trade unions were there to put into operation workers  control of industry  in every village  town  city  district and province there were soviets of workers   soldiers  and peasants  deputies  prepared to assume the task of local administration   no matter what one thinks of bolshevism  it is undeniable that the russian revolution is one of the great events of human history  and the rise of the bolsheviki a phenomenon of world wide importance  just as historians search the records for the minutest details of the story of the paris commune  so they will want to know what happened in petrograd in november  1917  the spirit which animated the people  and how the leaders looked  talked and acted  it is with this in view that i have written this book   in the struggle my sympathies were not neutral  but in telling the story of those great days i have tried to see events with the eye of a conscientious reporter  interested in setting down the truth                                          j  r      new york  january 1st 1919                            notes and explanations  to the average reader the multiplicity of russian organisations political groups  committees and central committees  soviets  dumas and unions will prove extremely confusing  for this reason i am giving here a few brief definitions and explanations                           political parties  in the elections to the constituent assembly  there were seventeen tickets in petrograd  and in some of the provincial towns as many as forty  but the following summary of the aims and composition of political parties is limited to the groups and factions mentioned in this book  only the essence of their programmes and the general character of their constituencies can be noticed        1   monarchists   of various shades   octobrists   etc  these once powerful factions no longer existed openly  they either worked underground  or their members joined the  cadets   as the  cadets  came by degrees to stand for their political programme  representatives in this book  rodzianko  shulgin     2   cadets   so called from the initials of its name  constitutional democrats  its official name is  party of the people s freedom   under the tsar composed of liberals from the propertied classes  the  cadets  were the great party of  political  reform  roughly corresponding to the progressive party in america  when the revolution broke out in march  1917  the  cadets  formed the first provisional government  the  cadet  ministry was overthrown in april because it declared itself in favour of allied imperialistic aims  including the imperialistic aims of the tsar s government  as the revolution became more and more a  social economic  revolution  the  cadets  grew more and more conservative  its representatives in this book are  miliukov  vinaver  shatsky     2a   group of public men   after the  cadets  had become unpopular through their relations with the kornilov counter revolution  the  group of public men  was formed in moscow  delegates from the  group of public men  were given portfolios in the last kerensky cabinet  the  group  declared itself non partisan  although its intellectual leaders were men like rodzianko and shulgin  it was composed of the more  modern  bankers  merchants and manufacturers  who were intelligent enough to realise that the soviets must be fought by their own weapon economic organisation  typical of the  group   lianozov  konovalov     3   populist socialists   or  trudoviki   labour group   numerically a small party  composed of cautious intellectuals  the leaders of the cooperative societies  and conservative peasants  professing to be socialists  the  populists  really supported the interests of the petty bourgeoisie clerks  shopkeepers  etc  by direct descent  inheritors of the compromising tradition of the labour group in the fourth imperial duma  which was composed largely of peasant representatives  kerensky was the leader of the  trudoviki  in the imperial duma when the revolution of march  1917  broke out  the  populist socialists  are a nationalistic party  their representatives in this book are  peshekhanov  tchaikovsky     4   russian social democratic labour party   originally marxian socialists  at a party congress held in 1903  the party split  on the question of tactics  into two factions the majority  bolshinstvo   and the minority  menshinstvo   from this sprang the names  bolsheviki  and  mensheviki   members of the majority  and  members of the minority   these two wings became two separate parties  both calling themselves  russian social democratic labour party   and both professing to be marxians  since the revolution of 1905 the bolsheviki were really the minority  becoming again the majority in september  1917     a   mensheviki   this party includes all shades of socialists who believe that society must progress by natural evolution toward socialism  and that the working class must conquer political power first  also a nationalistic party  this was the party of the socialist intellectuals  which means  all the means of education having been in the hands of the propertied classes  the intellectuals instinctively reacted to their training  and took the side of the propertied classes  among their representatives in this book are  dan  lieber  tseretelli     b   mensheviki internationalists   the radical wing of the  mensheviki   internationalists and opposed to all coalition with the propertied classes  yet unwilling to break loose from the conservative mensheviki  and opposed to the dictatorship of the working class advocated by the bolsheviki  trotzky was long a member of this group  among their leaders  martov  martinov     c   bolsheviki   now call themselves the  communist party   in order to emphasise their complete separation from the tradition of  moderate  or  parliamentary  socialism  which dominates the mensheviki and the so called majority socialists in all countries  the  bolsheviki  proposed immediate proletarian insurrection  and seizure of the reins of government  in order to hasten the coming of socialism by forcibly taking over industry  land  natural resources and financial institutions  this party expresses the desires chiefly of the factory workers  but also of a large section of the poor peasants  the name  bolshevik  can  not  be translated by  maximalist   the maximalists are a separate group   see paragraph 5b   among the leaders  lenin  trotzky  lunatcharsky     d   united social democrats internationalists   also called the  novaya zhizn   new life  group  from the name of the very influential newspaper which was its organ  a little group of intellectuals with a very small following among the working class  except the personal following of maxim gorky  its leader  intellectuals  with almost the same programme as the  mensheviki internationalists   except that the  novaya zhizn  group refused to be tied to either of the two great factions  opposed the bolshevik tactics  but remained in the soviet government  other representatives in this book  avilov  kramarov     e   yedinstvo   a very small and dwindling group  composed almost entirely of the personal following of plekhanov  one of the pioneers of the russian social democratic movement in the 80 s  and its greatest theoretician  now an old man  plekhanov was extremely patriotic  too conservative even for the mensheviki  after the bolshevik  coup d etat  yedinstvo  disappeared     5   socialist revolutionary party   called  essaires  from the initials of their name  originally the revolutionary party of the peasants  the party of the fighting organisations the terrorists  after the march revolution  it was joined by many who had never been socialists  at that time it stood for the abolition of private property in land only  the owners to be compensated in some fashion  finally the increasing revolutionary feeling of peasants forced the  essaires  to abandon the  compensation  clause  and led to the younger and more fiery intellectuals breaking off from the main party in the fall of 1917 and forming a new party  the  left socialist revolutionary party   the  essaires   who were afterward always called by the radical groups   right socialist revolutionaries    adopted the political attitude of the mensheviki  and worked together with them  they finally came to represent the wealthier peasants  the intellectuals  and the politically uneducated populations of remote rural districts  among them there was  however  a wider difference of shades of political and economic opinion than among the mensheviki  among their leaders mentioned in these pages  avksentiev  gotz  kerensky  tchernov   babuschka  breshkovskaya     a   left socialist revolutionaries   although theoretically sharing the bolshevik programme of dictatorship of the working class  at first were reluctant to follow the ruthless bolshevik tactics  however  the  left socialist revolutionaries  remained in the soviet government  sharing the cabinet portfolios  especially that of agriculture  they withdrew from the government several times  but always returned  as the peasants left the ranks of the  essaires  in increasing numbers  they joined the  left socialist revolutionary party   which became the great peasant party supporting the soviet government  standing for confiscation without compensation of the great landed estates  and their disposition by the peasants themselves  among the leaders  spiridonova  karelin  kamkov  kalagayev     b   maximalists   an off shoot of the  socialist revolutionary party  in the revolution of 1905  when it was a powerful peasant movement  demanding the immediate application of the maximum socialist programme  now an insignificant group of peasant anarchists                           parliamentary procedure  russian meetings and conventions are organised after the continental model rather than our own  the first action is usually the election of officers and the  presidium      the  presidium  is a presiding committee  composed of representatives of the groups and political factions represented in the assembly  in proportion to their numbers  the  presidium  arranges the order of business  and its members can be called upon by the president to take the chair  pro tem      each question   vopros   is stated in a general way and then debated  and at the close of the debate resolutions are submitted by the different factions  and each one voted on separately  the order of business can be  and usually is  smashed to pieces in the first half hour  on the plea of  emergency   which the crowd almost always grants  anybody from the floor can get up and say anything on any subject  the crowd controls the meeting  practically the only functions of the speaker being to keep order by ringing a little bell  and to recognise speakers  almost all the real work of the session is done in caucuses of the different groups and political factions  which almost always cast their votes in a body and are represented by floor leaders  the result is  however  that at every important new point  or vote  the session takes a recess to enable the different groups and political factions to hold a caucus     the crowd is extremely noisy  cheering or heckling speakers  over riding the plans of the  presidium   among the customary cries are    prosim   please  go on     pravilno    or   eto vierno   that s true  right     do volno   enough     doloi   down with him     posor   shame   and   teesche   silence  not so noisy                            popular organisations  1   soviet   the word  soviet  means  council   under the tsar the imperial council of state was called  gosudarstvennyi soviet   since the revolution  however  the term  soviet  has come to be associated with a certain type of parliament elected by members of working class economic organisations the soviet of workers   of soldiers   or of peasants  deputies  i have therefore limited the word to these bodies  and wherever else it occurs i have translated it  council      besides the local  soviets   elected in every city  town and village of russia and in large cities  also ward   raionny  soviets  there are also the  oblastne  or  gubiernsky   district or provincial   soviets   and the central executive committee of the all russian  soviets  in the capital  called from its initials  tsay ee kah    see below   central committees       almost everywhere the  soviets  of workers  and of soldiers  deputies combined very soon after the march revolution  in special matters concerning their peculiar interests  however  the workers  and the soldiers  sections continued to meet separately  the  soviets  of peasants  deputies did not join the other two until after the bolshevik  coup d etat   they  too  were organised like the workers and soldiers  with an executive committee of the all russian peasants   soviets  in the capital     2   trade unions   although mostly industrial in form  the russian labour unions were still called trade unions  and at the time of the bolshevik revolution had from three to four million members  these unions were also organised in an all russian body  a sort of russian federation of labour  which had its central executive committee in the capital     3   factory shop committees   these were spontaneous organisations created in the factories by the workers in their attempt to control industry  taking advantage of the administrative break down incident upon the revolution  their function was by revolutionary action to take over and run the factories  the  factory shop committees  also had their all russian organisation  with a central committee at petrograd  which co operated with the trade unions     4   dumas   the word  duma  means roughly  deliberative body   the old imperial duma  which persisted six months after the revolution  in a democratised form  died a natural death in september  1917  the  city duma  referred to in this book was the reorganised municipal council  often called  municipal self government   it was elected by direct and secret ballot  and its only reason for failure to hold the masses during the bolshevik revolution was the general decline in influence of all purely  political  representation in the fact of the growing power of organisations based on  economic  groups     5   zemstvos   may be roughly translated  county councils   under the tsar semi political  semi social bodies with very little administrative power  developed and controlled largely by intellectual liberals among the land owning classes  their most important function was education and social service among the peasants  during the war the  zemstvos  gradually took over the entire feeding and clothing of the russian army  as well as the buying from foreign countries  and work among the soldiers generally corresponding to the work of the american y  m  c  a  at the front  after the march revolution the  zemstvos  were democratized  with a view to making them the organs of local government in the rural districts  but like the  city dumas   they could not compete with the  soviets      6   cooperatives   these were the workers  and peasants  consumers  cooperative societies  which had several million members all over russia before the revolution  founded by liberals and  moderate  socialists  the cooperative movement was not supported by the revolutionary socialist groups  because it was a substitute for the complete transference of means of production and distribution into the hands of the workers  after the march revolution the  cooperatives  spread rapidly  and were dominated by populist socialists  mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries  and acted as a conservative political force until the bolshevik revolution  however  it was the  cooperatives  which fed russia when the old structure of commerce and transportation collapsed     7   army committees   the  army committees  were formed by the soldiers at the front to combat the reactionary influence of the old regime officers  every company  regiment  brigade  division and corps had its committee  over all of which was elected the  army committee   the  central army committee  cooperated with the general staff  the administrative break down in the army incident upon the revolution threw upon the shoulders of the  army committees  most of the work of the quartermaster s department  and in some cases  even the command of troops     8   fleet committees   the corresponding organisations in the navy                           central committees  in the spring and summer of 1917  all russian conventions of every sort of organisation were held at petrograd  there were national congresses of workers   soldiers  and peasants  soviets  trade unions  factory shop committees  army and fleet committees besides every branch of the military and naval service  cooperatives  nationalities  etc  each of these conventions elected a central committee  or a central executive committee  to guard its particular interests at the seat of government  as the provisional government grew weaker  these central committees were forced to assume more and more administrative powers     the most important central committees mentioned in this book are      union of unions   during the revolution of 1905  professor miliukov and other liberals established unions of professional men doctors  lawyers  physicians  etc  these were united under one central organisation  the  union of unions   in 1905 the  union of unions  acted with the revolutionary democracy  in 1917  however  the  union of unions  opposed the bolshevik uprising  and united the government employees who went on strike against the authority of the soviets      tsay ee kah   all russian central executive committee of the soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies  so called from the initials of its name      tsentroflot    centre fleet  the central fleet committee      vikzhel   all russian central committee of the railway workers  union  so called from the initials of its name                           other organisations   red guards   the armed factory workers of russia  the  red guards  were first formed during the revolution of 1905  and sprang into existence again in the days of march  1917  when a force was needed to keep order in the city  at that time they were armed  and all efforts of the provisional government to disarm them were more or less unsuccessful  at every great crisis in the revolution the  red guards  appeared on the streets  untrained and undisciplined  but full of revolutionary zeal      white guards   bourgeois volunteers  who emerged in the last stages of the revolution  to defend private property from the bolshevik attempt to abolish it  a great many of them were university students      tekhintsi   the so called  savage division  in the army  made up of mohametan tribesmen from central asia  and personally devoted to general kornilov  the  tekhintsi  were noted for their blind obedience and their savage cruelty in warfare      death battalions   or  shock battalions   the women s battalion is known to the world as the  death battalion   but there were many  death battalions  composed of men  these were formed in the summer of 1917 by kerensky  for the purpose of strengthening the discipline and combative fire of the army by heroic example  the  death battalions  were composed mostly of intense young patriots  these came for the most part from among the sons of the propertied classes      union of officers   an organisation formed among the reactionary officers in the army to combat politically the growing power of the army committees      knights of st  george   the cross of st  george was awarded for distinguished action in battle  its holder automatically became a   knight of st  george    the predominant influence in the organisation was that of the supporters of the military idea      peasants  union   in 1905  the  peasants  union  was a revolutionary peasants  organisation  in 1917  however  it had become the political expression of the more prosperous peasants  to fight the growing power and revolutionary aims of the soviets of peasants  deputies                           chronology and spelling  i have adopted in this book our calendar throughout  instead of the former russian calendar  which was thirteen days earlier     in the spelling of russian names and words  i have made no attempt to follow any scientific rules for transliteration  but have tried to give the spelling which would lead the english speaking reader to the simplest approximation of their pronunciation                           sources  much of the material in this book is from my own notes  i have also relied  however  upon a heterogeneous file of several hundred assorted russian newspapers  covering almost every day of the time described  of files of the english paper  the  russian daily news   and of the two french papers   journal de russie  and  entente   but far more valuable than these is the  bulletin de la presse  issued daily by the french information bureau in petrograd  which reports all important happenings  speeches and the comment of the russian press  of this i have an almost complete file from the spring of 1917 to the end of january  1918     besides the foregoing  i have in my possession almost every proclamation  decree and announcement posted on the walls of petrograd from the middle of september  1917  to the end of january  1918  also the official publication of all government decrees and orders  and the official government publication of the secret treaties and other documents discovered in the ministry of foreign affairs when the bolsheviki took it over                     ten days that shook the world                                chapter i                               background  toward the end of september  1917  an alien professor of sociology visiting russia came to see me in petrograd  he had been informed by business men and intellectuals that the revolution was slowing down  the professor wrote an article about it  and then travelled around the country  visiting factory towns and peasant communities where  to his astonishment  the revolution seemed to be speeding up  among the wage earners and the land working people it was common to hear talk of  all land to the peasants  all factories to the workers   if the professor had visited the front  he would have heard the whole army talking peace      the professor was puzzled  but he need not have been  both observations were correct  the property owning classes were becoming more conservative  the masses of the people more radical   there was a feeling among business men and the  intelligentzia  generally that the revolution had gone quite far enough  and lasted too long  that things should settle down  this sentiment was shared by the dominant  moderate  socialist groups  the  oborontsi   see app  i  sect  1  mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries  who supported the provisional government of kerensky   on october 14th the official organ of the  moderate  socialists said   the drama of revolution has two acts  the destruction of the old r gime and the creation of the new one  the first act has lasted long enough  now it is time to go on to the second  and to play it as rapidly as possible  as a great revolutionist put it   let us hasten  friends  to terminate the revolution  he who makes it last too long will not gather the fruits       among the worker  soldier and peasant masses  however  there was a stubborn feeling that the  first act  was not yet played out  on the front the army committees were always running foul of officers who could not get used to treating their men like human beings  in the rear the land committees elected by the peasants were being jailed for trying to carry out government regulations concerning the land  and the workmen  see app  i  sect  2  in the factories were fighting black lists and lockouts  nay  furthermore  returning political exiles were being excluded from the country as  undesirable  citizens  and in some cases  men who returned from abroad to their villages were prosecuted and imprisoned for revolutionary acts committed in 1905   to the multiform discontent of the people the  moderate  socialists had one answer  wait for the constituent assembly  which is to meet in december  but the masses were not satisfied with that  the constituent assembly was all well and good  but there were certain definite things for which the russian revolution had been made  and for which the revolutionary martyrs rotted in their stark brotherhood grave on mars field  that must be achieved constituent assembly or no constituent assembly  peace  land  and workers  control of industry  the constituent assembly had been postponed and postponed would probably be postponed again  until the people were calm enough perhaps to modify their demands  at any rate  here were eight months of the revolution gone  and little enough to show for it      meanwhile the soldiers began to solve the peace question by simply deserting  the peasants burned manor houses and took over the great estates  the workers sabotaged and struck     of course  as was natural  the manufacturers  land owners and army officers exerted all their influence against any democratic compromise      the policy of the provisional government alternated between ineffective reforms and stern repressive measures  an edict from the socialist minister of labour ordered all the workers  committees henceforth to meet only after working hours  among the troops at the front   agitators  of opposition political parties were arrested  radical newspapers closed down  and capital punishment applied to revolutionary propagandists  attempts were made to disarm the red guard  cossacks were sent to keep order in the provinces      these measures were supported by the  moderate  socialists and their leaders in the ministry  who considered it necessary to cooperate with the propertied classes  the people rapidly deserted them  and went over to the bolsheviki  who stood for peace  land  and workers  control of industry  and a government of the working class  in september  1917  matters reached a crisis  against the overwhelming sentiment of the country  kerensky and the  moderate  socialists succeeded in establishing a government of coalition with the propertied classes  and as a result  the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries lost the confidence of the people forever   an article in  rabotchi put   workers  way  about the middle of october  entitled  the socialist ministers   expressed the feeling of the masses of the people against the  moderate  socialists   here is a list of their services  see app  i  sect  3   tseretelli  disarmed the workmen with the assistance of general polovtsev  checkmated the revolutionary soldiers  and approved of capital punishment in the army   skobeliev  commenced by trying to tax the capitalists 100  of their profits  and finished and finished by an attempt to dissolve the workers  committees in the shops and factories   avksentiev  put several hundred peasants in prison  members of the land committees  and suppressed dozens of workers  and soldiers  newspapers   tchernov  signed the  imperial  manifest  ordering the dissolution of the finnish diet   savinkov  concluded an open alliance with general kornilov  if this saviour of the country was not able to betray petrograd  it was due to reasons over which he had no control   zarudny  with the sanction of alexinsky and kerensky  put some of the best workers of the revolution  soldiers and sailors  in prison   nikitin  acted as a vulgar policeman against the railway workers   kerensky  it is better not to say anything about him  the list of his services is too long      a congress of delegates of the baltic fleet  at helsingfors  passed a resolution which began as follows   we demand the immediate removal from the ranks of the provisional government of the  socialist   the political adventurer kerensky  as one who is scandalising and ruining the great revolution  and with it the revolutionary masses  by his shameless political blackmail on behalf of the bourgeoisie      the direct result of all this was the rise of the bolsheviki      since march  1917  when the roaring torrents of workmen and soldiers beating upon the tauride palace compelled the reluctant imperial duma to assume the supreme power in russia  it was the masses of the people  workers  soldiers and peasants  which forced every change in the course of the revolution  they hurled the miliukov ministry down  it was their soviet which proclaimed to the world the russian peace terms  no annexations  no indemnities  and the right of self determination of peoples   and again  in july  it was the spontaneous rising of the unorganised proletariat which once more stormed the tauride palace  to demand that the soviets take over the government of russia   the bolsheviki  then a small political sect  put themselves at the head of the movement  as a result of the disastrous failure of the rising  public opinion turned against them  and their leaderless hordes slunk back into the viborg quarter  which is petrograd s  st  antoine   then followed a savage hunt of the bolsheviki  hundreds were imprisoned  among them trotzky  madame kollontai and kameniev  lenin and zinoviev went into hiding  fugitives from justice  the bolshevik papers were suppressed  provocators and reactionaries raised the cry that the bolsheviki were german agents  until people all over the world believed it   but the provisional government found itself unable to substantiate its accusations  the documents proving pro german conspiracy were discovered to be forgeries      and one by one the bolsheviki were   part of the famous  sisson documents   released from prison without trial  on nominal or no bail until only six remained  the impotence and indecision of the ever changing provisional government was an argument nobody could refute  the bolsheviki raised again the slogan so dear to the masses   all power to the soviets   and they were not merely self seeking  for at that time the majority of the soviets was  moderate  socialist  their bitter enemy   but more potent still  they took the crude  simple desires of the workers  soldiers and peasants  and from them built their immediate programme  and so  while the  oborontsi  mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries involved themselves in compromise with the bourgeoisie  the bolsheviki rapidly captured the russian masses  in july they were hunted and despised  by september the metropolitan workmen  the sailors of the baltic fleet  and the soldiers  had been won almost entirely to their cause  the september municipal elections in the large cities  see app  i  sect  4  were significant  only 18 per cent of the returns were menshevik and socialist revolutionary  against more than 70 per cent in june      there remains a phenomenon which puzzled foreign observers  the fact that the central executive committees of the soviets  the central army and fleet committees      and the central committees of some of   see notes and explanations   the unions notably  the post and telegraph workers and the railway workers opposed the bolsheviki with the utmost violence  these central committees had all been elected in the middle of the summer  or even before  when the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries had an enormous following  and they delayed or prevented any new elections  thus  according to the constitution of the soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies  the all russian congress  should have been called in september   but the  tsay ee kah      would not   see notes and explanations   call the meeting  on the ground that the constituent assembly was only two months away  at which time  they hinted  the soviets would abdicate  meanwhile  one by one  the bolsheviki were winning in the local soviets all over the country  in the union branches and the ranks of the soldiers and sailors  the peasants  soviets remained still conservative  because in the sluggish rural districts political consciousness developed slowly  and the socialist revolutionary party had been for a generation the party which had agitated among the peasants     but even among the peasants a revolutionary wing was forming  it showed itself clearly in october  when the left wing of the socialist revolutionaries split off  and formed a new political faction  the left socialist revolutionaries   at the same time there were signs everywhere that the forces of reaction were gaining confidence  see app  i  sect  5  at the troitsky farce theatre in petrograd  for example  a burlesque called  sins of the tsar  was interrupted by a group of monarchists  who threatened to lynch the actors for  insulting the emperor   certain newspapers began to sigh for a  russian napoleon   it was the usual thing among bourgeois  intelligentzia  to refer to the soviets of workers  deputies  rabotchikh deputatov  as  sabatchikh  deputatov dogs  deputies   on october 15th i had a conversation with a great russian capitalist  stepan georgevitch lianozov  known as the  russian rockefeller  a cadet by political faith    revolution   he said   is a sickness  sooner or later the foreign powers must intervene here as one would intervene to cure a sick child  and teach it how to walk  of course it would be more or less improper  but the nations must realise the danger of bolshevism in their own countries such contagious ideas as  proletarian dictatorship   and  world social revolution     there is a chance that this intervention may not be necessary  transportation is demoralised  the factories are closing down  and the germans are advancing  starvation and defeat may bring the russian people to their senses       mr  lianozov was emphatic in his opinion that whatever happened  it would be impossible for merchants and manufacturers to permit the existence of the workers  shop committees  or to allow the workers any share in the management of industry    as for the bolsheviki  they will be done away with by one of two methods  the government can evacuate petrograd  then a state of siege declared  and the military commander of the district can deal with these gentlemen without legal formalities      or if  for example  the constituent assembly manifests any utopian tendencies  it can be dispersed by force of arms        winter was coming on the terrible russian winter  i heard business men speak of it so   winter was always russia s best friend  perhaps now it will rid us of revolution   on the freezing front miserable armies continued to starve and die  without enthusiasm  the railways were breaking down  food lessening  factories closing  the desperate masses cried out that the bourgeoisie was sabotaging the life of the people  causing defeat on the front  riga had been surrendered just after general kornilov said publicly   must we pay with riga the price of bringing the country to a sense of its duty          see  kornilov to brest litvosk  by john reed  boni and liveright n y   1919   to americans it is incredible that the class war should develop to such a pitch  but i have personally met officers on the northern front who frankly preferred military disaster to cooperation with the soldiers  committees  the secretary of the petrograd branch of the cadet party told me that the break down of the country s economic life was part of a campaign to discredit the revolution  an allied diplomat  whose name i promised not to mention  confirmed this from his own knowledge  i know of certain coal mines near kharkov which were fired and flooded by their owners  of textile factories at moscow whose engineers put the machinery out of order when they left  of railroad officials caught by the workers in the act of crippling locomotives      a large section of the propertied classes preferred the germans to the revolution even to the provisional government and didn t hesitate to say so  in the russian household where i lived  the subject of conversation at the dinner table was almost invariably the coming of the germans  bringing  law and order      one evening i spent at the house of a moscow merchant  during tea we asked the eleven people at the table whether they preferred  wilhelm or the bolsheviki   the vote was ten to one for wilhelm     the speculators took advantage of the universal disorganisation to pile up fortunes  and to spend them in fantastic revelry or the corruption of government officials  foodstuffs and fuel were hoarded  or secretly sent out of the country to sweden  in the first four months of the revolution  for example  the reserve food supplies were almost openly looted from the great municipal warehouses of petrograd  until the two years  provision of grain had fallen to less than enough to feed the city for one month     according to the official report of the last minister of supplies in the provisional government  coffee was bought wholesale in vladivostok for two rubles a pound  and the consumer in petrograd paid thirteen  in all the stores of the large cities were tons of food and clothing  but only the rich could buy them   in a provincial town i knew a merchant family turned speculator  maradior   bandit  ghoul  the russians call it  the three sons had bribed their way out of military service  one gambled in foodstuffs  another sold illegal gold from the lena mines to mysterious parties in finland  the third owned a controlling interest in a chocolate factory  which supplied the local cooperative societies on condition that the cooperatives furnished him everything he needed  and so  while the masses of the people got a quarter pound of black bread on their bread cards  he had an abundance of white bread  sugar  tea  candy  cake and butter     yet when the soldiers at the front could no longer fight from cold  hunger and exhaustion  how indignantly did this family scream  cowards   how  ashamed  they were  to be russians     when finally the bolsheviki found and requisitioned vast hoarded stores of provisions  what  robbers  they were   beneath all this external rottenness moved the old time dark forces  unchanged since the fall of nicholas the second  secret still and very active  the agents of the notorious  okhrana  still functioned  for and against the tsar  for and against kerensky whoever would pay     in the darkness  underground organisations of all sorts  such as the black hundreds  were busy attempting to restore reaction in some form or other   in this atmosphere of corruption  of monstrous half truths  one clear note sounded day after day  the deepening chorus of the bolsheviki   all power to the soviets  all power to the direct representatives of millions on millions of common workers  soldiers  peasants  land  bread  an end to the senseless war  an end to secret diplomacy  speculation  treachery     the revolution is in danger  and with it the cause of the people all over the world    the struggle between the proletariat and the middle class  between the soviets and the government  which had begun in the first march days  was about to culminate  having at one bound leaped from the middle ages into the twentieth century  russia showed the startled world two systems of revolution the political and the social in mortal combat   what a revelation of the vitality of the russian revolution  after all these months of starvation and disillusionment  the bourgeoisie should have better known its russia  not for a long time in russia will the  sickness  of revolution have run its course      looking back  russia before the november insurrection seems of another age  almost incredibly conservative  so quickly did we adapt ourselves to the newer  swifter life  just as russian politics swung bodily to the left until the cadets were outlawed as  enemies of the people   kerensky became a  counter revolutionist   the  middle  socialist leaders  tseretelli  dan  lieber  gotz and avksentiev  were too reactionary for their following  and men like victor tchernov  and even maxim gorky  belonged to the right wing      about the middle of december  1917  a group of socialist revolutionary leaders paid a private visit to sir george buchanan  the british ambassador  and implored him not to mention the fact that they had been there  because they were  considered too far right     and to think   said sir george   one year ago my government instructed me not to receive miliukov  because he was so dangerously left    september and october are the worst months of the russian year especially the petrograd year  under dull grey skies  in the shortening days  the rain fell drenching  incessant  the mud underfoot was deep  slippery and clinging  tracked everywhere by heavy boots  and worse than usual because of the complete break down of the municipal administration  bitter damp winds rushed in from the gulf of finland  and the chill fog rolled through the streets  at night  for motives of economy as well as fear of zeppelins  the street lights were few and far between  in private dwellings and apartment houses the electricity was turned on from six o clock until midnight  with candles forty cents apiece and little kerosene to be had  it was dark from three in the afternoon to ten in the morning  robberies and housebreakings increased  in apartment houses the men took turns at all night guard duty  armed with loaded rifles  this was under the provisional government   week by week food became scarcer  the daily allowance of bread fell from a pound and a half to a pound  then three quarters  half  and a quarter pound  toward the end there was a week without any bread at all  sugar one was entitled to at the rate of two pounds a month if one could get it at all  which was seldom  a bar of chocolate or a pound of tasteless candy cost anywhere from seven to ten rubles at least a dollar  there was milk for about half the babies in the city  most hotels and private houses never saw it for months  in the fruit season apples and pears sold for a little less than a ruble apiece on the street corner      for milk and bread and sugar and tobacco one had to stand in  queue  long hours in the chill rain  coming home from an all night meeting i have seen the  kvost   tail  beginning to form before dawn  mostly women  some with babies in their arms     carlyle  in his  french revolution   has described the french people as distinguished above all others by their faculty of standing in  queue   russia had accustomed herself to the practice  begun in the reign of nicholas the blessed as long ago as 1915  and from then continued intermittently until the summer of 1917  when it settled down as the regular order of things  think of the poorly clad people standing on the iron white streets of petrograd whole days in the russian winter  i have listened in the bread lines  hearing the bitter  acrid note of discontent which from time to time burst up through the miraculous goodnature of the russian crowd      of course all the theatres were going every night  including sundays  karsavina appeared in a new ballet at the marinsky  all dance loving russia coming to see her  shaliapin was singing  at the alexandrinsky they were reviving meyerhold s production of tolstoy s  death of ivan the terrible   and at that performance i remember noticing a student of the imperial school of pages  in his dress uniform  who stood up correctly between the acts and faced the empty imperial box  with its eagles all erased     the  krivoye zerkalo  staged a sumptuous version of schnitzler s  reigen    although the hermitage and other picture galleries had been evacuated to moscow  there were weekly exhibitions of paintings  hordes of the female  intelligentzia  went to hear lectures on art  literature and the easy philosophies  it was a particularly active season for theosophists  and the salvation army  admitted to russia for the first time in history  plastered the walls with announcements of gospel meetings  which amused and astounded russian audiences      as in all such times  the petty conventional life of the city went on  ignoring the revolution as much as possible  the poets made verses but not about the revolution  the realistic painters painted scenes from medi val russian history anything but the revolution  young ladies from the provinces came up to the capital to learn french and cultivate their voices  and the gay young beautiful officers wore their gold trimmed crimson  bashliki  and their elaborate caucasian swords around the hotel lobbies  the ladies of the minor bureaucratic set took tea with each other in the afternoon  carrying each her little gold or silver or jewelled sugar box  and half a loaf of bread in her muff  and wished that the tsar were back  or that the germans would come  or anything that would solve the servant problem     the daughter of a friend of mine came home one afternoon in hysterics because the woman street car conductor had called her  comrade    all around them great russia was in travail  bearing a new world  the servants one used to treat like animals and pay next to nothing  were getting independent  a pair of shoes cost more than a hundred rubles  and as wages averaged about thirty five rubles a month the servants refused to stand in  queue  and wear out their shoes  but more than that  in the new russia every man and woman could vote  there were working class newspapers  saying new and startling things  there were the soviets  and there were the unions  the  izvoshtchiki   cab drivers  had a union  they were also represented in the petrograd soviet  the waiters and hotel servants were organised  and refused tips  on the walls of restaurants they put up signs which read   no tips taken here   or   just because a man has to make his living waiting on table is no reason to insult him by offering him a tip    at the front the soldiers fought out their fight with the officers  and learned self government through their committees  in the factories those unique russian organisations  the factory shop committees      gained experience and strength and a realisation of    see notes and explanations  their historical mission by combat with the old order  all russia was learning to read  and  reading  politics  economics  history because the people wanted to  know      in every city  in most towns  along the front  each political faction had its newspaper sometimes several  hundreds of thousands of pamphlets were distributed by thousands of organisations  and poured into the armies  the villages  the factories  the streets  the thirst for education  so long thwarted  burst with the revolution into a frenzy of expression  from smolny institute alone  the first six months  went out every day tons  car loads  train loads of literature  saturating the land  russia absorbed reading matter like hot sand drinks water  insatiable  and it was not fables  falsified history  diluted religion  and the cheap fiction that corrupts but social and economic theories  philosophy  the works of tolstoy  gogol  and gorky      then the talk  beside which carlyle s  flood of french speech  was a mere trickle  lectures  debates  speeches in theatres  circuses  school houses  clubs  soviet meeting rooms  union headquarters  barracks     meetings in the trenches at the front  in village squares  factories     what a marvellous sight to see putilovsky zavod  the putilov factory  pour out its forty thousand to listen to social democrats  socialist revolutionaries  anarchists  anybody  whatever they had to say  as long as they would talk  for months in petrograd  and all over russia  every street corner was a public tribune  in railway trains  street cars  always the spurting up of impromptu debate  everywhere      and the all russian conferences and congresses  drawing together the men of two continents conventions of soviets  of cooperatives  zemstvos      nationalities  priests  peasants  political parties  the    see notes and explanations  democratic conference  the moscow conference  the council of the russian republic  there were always three or four conventions going on in petrograd  at every meeting  attempts to limit the time of speakers voted down  and every man free to express the thought that was in him      we came down to the front of the twelfth army  back of riga  where gaunt and bootless men sickened in the mud of desperate trenches  and when they saw us they started up  with their pinched faces and the flesh showing blue through their torn clothing  demanding eagerly   did you bring anything to  read     what though the outward and visible signs of change were many  what though the statue of catharine the great before the alexandrinsky theatre bore a little red flag in its hand  and others somewhat faded floated from all public buildings  and the imperial monograms and eagles were either torn down or covered up  and in place of the fierce  gorodovoye   city police  a mild mannered and unarmed citizen militia patrolled the streets still  there were many quaint anachronisms   for example  peter the great s  tabel o rangov  table of ranks which he rivetted upon russia with an iron hand  still held sway  almost everybody from the school boy up wore his prescribed uniform  with the insignia of the emperor on button and shoulder strap  along about five o clock in the afternoon the streets were full of subdued old gentlemen in uniform  with portfolios  going home from work in the huge  barrack like ministries or government institutions  calculating perhaps how great a mortality among their superiors would advance them to the coveted  tchin   rank  of collegiate assessor  or privy councillor  with the prospect of retirement on a comfortable pension  and possibly the cross of st  anne      there is the story of senator sokolov  who in full tide of revolution came to a meeting of the senate one day in civilian clothes  and was not admitted because he did not wear the prescribed livery of the tsar s service   it was against this background of a whole nation in ferment and disintegration that the pageant of the rising of the russian masses unrolled                                    chapter ii                            the coming storm  in september general kornilov marched on petrograd to make himself military dictator of russia  behind him was suddenly revealed the mailed fist of the bourgeoisie  boldly attempting to crush the revolution  some of the socialist ministers were implicated  even kerensky was under suspicion   see app  ii  sect  1  savinkov  summoned to explain to the central committee of his party  the socialist revolutionaries  refused and was expelled  kornilov was arrested by the soldiers  committees  generals were dismissed  ministers suspended from their functions  and the cabinet fell   kerensky tried to form a new government  including the cadets  party of the bourgeoisie  his party  the socialist revolutionaries  ordered him to exclude the cadets  kerensky declined to obey  and threatened to resign from the cabinet if the socialists insisted  however  popular feeling ran so high that for the moment he did not dare oppose it  and a temporary directorate of five of the old ministers  with kerensky at the head  assumed the power until the question should be settled   the kornilov affair drew together all the socialist groups  moderates  as well as revolutionists in a passionate impulse of self defence  there must be no more kornilovs  a new government must be created  responsible to the elements supporting the revolution  so the  tsay ee kah  invited the popular organisations to send delegates to a democratic conference  which should meet at petrograd in september   in the  tsay ee kah  three factions immediately appeared  the bolsheviki demanded that the all russian congress of soviets be summoned  and that they take over the power  the  centre  socialist revolutionaries  led by tchernov  joined with the left socialist revolutionaries  led by kamkov and spiridonova  the mensheviki internationalists under martov  and the  centre  mensheviki         see notes and explanations   represented by bogdanov and skobeliev  in demanding a purely socialist government  tseretelli  dan and lieber  at the head of the right wing mensheviki  and the right socialist revolutionaries under avksentiev and gotz  insisted that the propertied classes must be represented in the new government   almost immediately the bolsheviki won a majority in the petrograd soviet  and the soviets of moscow  kiev  odessa and other cities followed suit   alarmed  the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries in control of the  tsay ee kah  decided that after all they feared the danger of kornilov less than the danger of lenin  they revised the plan of representation in the democratic conference   see app  ii  sect  2  admitting more delegates from the cooperative societies and other conservative bodies  even this packed assembly at first voted for a  coalition government without the cadets   only kerensky s open threat of resignation  and the alarming cries of the  moderate  socialists that  the republic is in danger  persuaded the conference  by a small majority  to declare in favour of the principle of coalition with the bourgeoisie  and to sanction the establishment of a sort of consultative parliament  without any legislative power  called the provisional council of the russian republic  in the new ministry the propertied classes practically controlled  and in the council of the russian republic they occupied a disproportionate number of seats   the fact is that the  tsay ee kah  no longer represented the rank and file of the soviets  and had illegally refused to call another all russian congress of soviets  due in september  it had no intention of calling this congress or of allowing it to be called  its official organ   izviestia   news   began to hint that the function of the soviets was nearly at an end   see app  ii  sect  3  and that they might soon be dissolved    at this time  too  the new government announced as part of its policy the liquidation of  irresponsible organisations  i e  the soviets   the bolsheviki responded by summoning the all russian soviets to meet at petrograd on november 2  and take over the government of russia  at the same time they withdrew from the council of the russian republic  stating that they would not participate in a  government of treason to the people    see app  ii  sect  4   the withdrawal of the bolsheviki  however  did not bring tranquillity to the ill fated council  the propertied classes  now in a position of power  became arrogant  the cadets declared that the government had no legal right to declare russia a republic  they demanded stern measures in the army and navy to destroy the soldiers  and sailors  committees  and denounced the soviets  on the other side of the chamber the mensheviki internationalists and the left socialist revolutionaries advocated immediate peace  land to the peasants  and workers  control of industry practically the bolshevik programme   i heard martov s speech in answer to the cadets  stooped over the desk of the tribune like the mortally sick man he was  and speaking in a voice so hoarse it could hardly be heard  he shook his finger toward the right benches    you call us defeatists  but the real defeatists are those who wait for a more propitious moment to conclude peace  insist upon postponing peace until later  until nothing is left of the russian army  until russia becomes the subject of bargaining between the different imperialist groups     you are trying to impose upon the russian people a policy dictated by the interests of the bourgeoisie  the question of peace should be raised without delay     you will see then that not in vain has been the work of those whom you call german agents  of those zimmerwaldists     who in all the    members of the revoloutionary internationalist wing of the socialists of europe  so called because of their participation in the international conference held at zimmerwald  switzerland  in 1915  lands have prepared the awakening of the conscience of the democratic masses       between these two groups the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries wavered  irresistibly forced to the left by the pressure of the rising dissatisfaction of the masses  deep hostility divided the chamber into irreconcilable groups   this was the situation when the long awaited announcement of the allied conference in paris brought up the burning question of foreign policy      theoretically all socialist parties in russia were in favour of the earliest possible peace on democratic terms  as long ago as may  1917  the petrograd soviet  then under control of the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries had proclaimed the famous russian peace conditions  they had demanded that the allies hold a conference to discuss war aims  this conference had been promised for august  then postponed until september  then until october  and now it was fixed for november 10th   the provisional government suggested two representatives general alexeyev  reactionary military man  and terestchenko  minister of foreign affairs  the soviets chose skobeliev to speak for them and drew up a manifesto  the famous  nakaz    see app  ii  sect  5  instructions  the provisional government  objected to skobeliev and his  nakaz   the allied ambassadors protested and finally bonar law in the british house of commons  in answer to a question  responded coldly   as far as i know the paris conference will not discuss the aims of the war at all  but only the methods of conducting it       at this the conservative russian press was jubilant  and the bolsheviki cried   see where the compromising tactics of the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries have led them    along a thousand miles of front the millions of men in russia s armies stirred like the sea rising  pouring into the capital their hundreds upon hundreds of delegations  crying  peace  peace    i went across the river to the cirque moderne  to one of the great popular meetings which occurred all over the city  more numerous night after night  the bare  gloomy amphitheatre  lit by five tiny lights hanging from a thin wire  was packed from the ring up the steep sweep of grimy benches to the very roof soldiers  sailors  workmen  women  all listening as if their lives depended upon it  a soldier was speaking from the five hundred and forty eight division  wherever and whatever that was    comrades   he cried  and there was real anguish in his drawn face and despairing gestures   the people at the top are always calling upon us to sacrifice more  sacrifice more  while those who have everything are left unmolested    we are at war with germany  would we invite german generals to serve on our staff  well we re at war with the capitalists too  and yet we invite them into our government       the soldier says   show me what i am fighting for  is it constantinople  or is it free russia  is it the democracy  or is it the capitalist plunderers  if you can prove to me that i am defending the revolution then i ll go out and fight without capital punishment to force me     when the land belongs to the peasants  and the factories to the workers  and the power to the soviets  then we ll know we have something to fight for  and we ll fight for it    in the barracks  the factories  on the street corners  end less soldier speakers  all clamouring for an end to the war  declaring that if the government did not make an energetic effort to get peace  the army would leave the trenches and go home   the spokesman for the eighth army    we are weak  we have only a few men left in each company  they must give us food and boots and reinforcements  or soon there will be left only empty trenches  peace or supplies    either let the government end the war or support the army       for the forty sixth siberian artillery    the officers will not work with our committees  they betray us to the enemy  they apply the death penalty to our agitators  and the counter revolutionary government supports them  we thought that the revolution would bring peace  but now the government forbids us even to talk of such things  and at the same time doesn t give us enough food to live on  or enough ammunition to fight with       from europe came rumours of peace at the expense of russia   see app  ii  sect  6      news of the treatment of russian troops in france added to the discontent  the first brigade had tried to replace its officers with soldiers  committees  like their comrades at home  and had refused an order to go to salonika  demanding to be sent to russia  they had been surrounded and starved  and then fired on by artillery  and many killed   see app  ii  sect  7      on october 29th i went to the white marble and crimson hall of the marinsky palace  where the council of the republic sat  to hear terestchenko s declaration of the government s foreign policy  awaited with such terrible anxiety by all the peace thirsty and exhausted land   a tall  impeccably dressed young man with a smooth face and high cheek bones  suavely reading his careful  non committal speech   see app  ii  sect  8  nothing     only the same platitudes about crushing german militarism with the help of the allies about the  state interests  of russia  about the  embarrassment  caused by skobeliev s  nakaz   he ended with the key note    russia is a great power  russia will remain a great power  whatever happens  we must all defend her  we must show that we are defenders of a great ideal  and children of a great power    nobody was satisfied  the reactionaries wanted a  strong  imperialist policy  the democratic parties wanted an assurance that the government would press for peace     i reproduce an editorial in  rabotchi i soldat   worker and soldier   organ of the bolshevik petrograd soviet   the government s answer to the trenches  the most taciturn of our ministers  mr  terestchenko  has actually told the trenches the following   1  we are closely united with our allies   not with the peoples  but with the governments    2  there is no use for the democracy to discuss the possibility or impossibility of a winter campaign  that will be decided by the governments of our allies   3  the 1st of july offensive was beneficial and a very happy affair   he did not mention the consequences    4  it is not true that our allies do not care about us  the minister has in his possession very important declarations   declarations  what about deeds  what about the behaviour of the british fleet   see app  ii  sect  9  the parleying of the british king with exiled counter revolutionary general gurko  the minister did not mention all this    5  the  nakaz  to skobeliev is bad  the allies don t like it and the russian diplomats don t like it  in the allied conference we must all  speak one language    and is that all  that is all  what is the way out  the solution is  faith in the allies and in terestchenko  when will peace come  when the allies permit   that is how the government replied to the trenches about peace   now in the background of russian politics began to form the vague outlines of a sinister power the cossacks   novaya zhizn   new life   gorky s paper  called attention to their activities   at the beginning of the revolution the cossacks refused to shoot down the people  when kornilov marched on petrograd they refused to follow him  from passive loyalty to the revolution the cossacks have passed to an active political offensive  against it   from the back ground of the revolution they have suddenly advanced to the front of the stage      kaledin   ataman  of the don cossacks  had been dismissed by the provisional government for his complicity in the kornilov affair  he flatly refused to resign  and surrounded by three immense cossack armies lay at novotcherkask  plotting and menacing  so great was his power that the government was forced to ignore his insubordination  more than that  it was compelled formally to recognise the council of the union of cossack armies  and to declare illegal the newly formed cossack section of the soviets      in the first part of october a cossack delegation called upon kerensky  arrogantly insisting that the charges against kaledin be dropped  and reproaching the minister president for yielding to the soviets  kerensky agreed to let kaledin alone  and then is reported to have said   in the eyes of the soviet leaders i am a despot and a tyrant     as for the provisional government  not only does it not depend upon the soviets  but it considers it regrettable that they exist at all    at the same time another cossack mission called upon the british ambassador  treating with him boldly as representatives of  the free cossack people    in the don something very like a cossack republic had been established  the kuban declared itself an independent cossack state  the soviets of rostov on don and yekaterinburg were dispersed by armed cossacks  and the headquarters of the coal miners  union at kharkov raided  in all its manifestations the cossack movement was anti socialist and militaristic  its leaders were nobles and great land owners  like kaledin  kornilov  generals dutov  karaulov and bardizhe  and it was backed by the powerful merchants and bankers of moscow      old russia was rapidly breaking up  in ukraine  in finland  poland  white russia  the nationalist movements gathered strength and became bolder  the local governments  controlled by the propertied classes  claimed autonomy  refusing to obey orders from petrograd  at helsingfors the finnish senate declined to loan money to the provisional government  declared finland autonomous  and demanded the withdrawal of russian troops  the bourgeois rada at kiev extended the boundaries of ukraine until they included all the richest agricultural lands of south russia  as far east as the urals  and began the formation of a national army  premier vinnitchenko hinted at a separate peace with germany and the provisional government was helpless  siberia  the caucasus  demanded separate constituent assemblies  and in all these countries there was the beginning of a bitter struggle between the authorities and the local soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies      conditions were daily more chaotic  hundreds of thousands of soldiers were deserting the front and beginning to move in vast  aimless tides over the face of the land  the peasants of tambov and tver governments  tired of waiting for the land  exasperated by the repressive measures of the government  were burning manor houses and massacring land owners  immense strikes and lock outs convulsed moscow  odessa and the coal mines of the don  transportation was paralysed  the army was starving and in the big cities there was no bread   the government  torn between the democratic and reactionary factions  could do nothing  when forced to act it always supported the interests of the propertied classes  cossacks were sent to restore order among the peasants  to break the strikes  in tashkent  government authorities suppressed the soviet  in petrograd the economic council  established to rebuild the shattered economic life of the country  came to a deadlock between the opposing forces of capital and labour  and was dissolved by kerensky  the old r gime military men  backed by cadets  demanded that harsh measures be adopted to restore discipline in the army and the navy  in vain admiral verderevsky  the venerable minister of marine  and general verkhovsky  minister of war  insisted that only a new  voluntary  democratic discipline  based on cooperation with the soldiers  and sailors  committees  could save the army and navy  their recommendations were ignored   the reactionaries seemed determined to provoke popular anger  the trial of kornilov was coming on  more and more openly the bourgeois press defended him  speaking of him as  the great russian patriot   burtzev s paper   obshtchee dielo   common cause   called for a dictatorship of kornilov  kaledin and kerensky   i had a talk with burtzev one day in the press gallery of the council of the republic  a small  stooped figure with a wrinkled face  eyes near sighted behind thick glasses  untidy hair and beard streaked with grey    mark my words  young man  what russia needs is a strong man  we should get our minds off the revolution now and concentrate on the germans  bunglers  bunglers  to defeat kornilov  and back of the bunglers are the german agents  kornilov should have won       on the extreme right the organs of the scarcely veiled monarchists  purishkevitch s  narodny tribun   people s tribune    novaya rus   new russia   and  zhivoye slovo   living word   openly advocated the extermination of the revolutionary democracy      on the 23rd of october occurred the naval battle with a german squadron in the gulf of riga  on the pretext that petrograd was in danger  the provisional government drew up plans for evacuating the capital  first the great munitions works were to go  distributed widely throughout russia  and then the government itself was to move to moscow  instantly the bolsheviki began to cry out that the government was abandoning the red capital in order to weaken the revolution  riga had been sold to the germans  now petrograd was being betrayed   the bourgeois press was joyful   at moscow   said the cadet paper  ryetch   speech    the government can pursue its work in a tranquil atmosphere  without being interfered with by anarchists   rodzianko  leader of the right wing of the cadet party  declared in  utro rossii   the morning of russia  that the taking of petrograd by the germans would be a blessing  because it would destroy the soviets and get rid of the revolutionary baltic fleet   petrograd is in danger  he wrote   i say to myself   let god take care of petrograd   they fear that if petrograd is lost the central revolutionary organisations will be destroyed  to that i answer that i rejoice if all these organisations are destroyed  for they will bring nothing but disaster upon russia      with the taking of petrograd the baltic fleet will also be destroyed     but there will be nothing to regret  most of the battleships are completely demoralised      in the face of a storm of popular disapproval the plan of evacuation was repudiated   meanwhile the congress of soviets loomed over russia like a thunder cloud  shot through with lightnings  it was opposed  not only by the government but by all the  moderate  socialists  the central army and fleet committees  the central committees of some of the trade unions  the peasants  soviets  but most of all the  tsay ee kah  itself  spared no pains to prevent the meeting   izviestia  and  golos soldata   voice of the soldier   newspapers founded by the petrograd soviet but now in the hands of the  tsay ee kah   fiercely assailed it  as did the entire artillery of the socialist revolutionary party press   dielo naroda   people s cause  and  volia naroda   people s will    delegates were sent through the country  messages flashed by wire to committees in charge of local soviets  to army committees  instructing them to halt or delay elections to the congress  solemn public resolutions against the congress  declarations that the democracy was opposed to the meeting so near the date of the constituent assembly  representatives from the front  from the union of zemstvos  the peasants  union  union of cossack armies  union of officers  knights of st  george  death battalions      protesting       see notes and explanations   the council of the russian republic was one chorus of disapproval  the entire machinery set up by the russian revolution of march functioned to block the congress of soviets      on the other hand was the shapeless will of the proletariat the workmen  common soldiers and poor peasants  many local soviets were already bolshevik  then there were the organisations of the industrial workers  the  fabritchno zavodskiye comitieti   factory shop committees  and the insurgent army and fleet organisations  in some places the people  prevented from electing their regular soviet delegates  held rump meetings and chose one of their number to go to petrograd  in others they smashed the old obstructionist committees and formed new ones  a ground swell of revolt heaved and cracked the crust which had been slowly hardening on the surface of revolutionary fires dormant all those months  only an spontaneous mass movement could bring about the all russian congress of soviets      day after day the bolshevik orators toured the barracks and factories  violently denouncing  this government of civil war   one sunday we went  on a top heavy steam tram that lumbered through oceans of mud  between stark factories and immense churches  to  obukhovsky zavod   a government munitions plant out on the schl sselburg prospekt   the meeting took place between the gaunt brick walls of a huge unfinished building  ten thousand black clothed men and women packed around a scaffolding draped in red  people heaped on piles of lumber and bricks  perched high upon shadowy girders  intent and thunder voiced  through the dull  heavy sky now and again burst the sun  flooding reddish light through the skeleton windows upon the mass of simple faces upturned to us   lunatcharsky  a slight  student like figure with the sensitive face of an artist  was telling why the power must be taken by the soviets  nothing else could guarantee the revolution against its enemies  who were deliberately ruining the country  ruining the army  creating opportunities for a new konilov   a soldier from the rumanian front  thin  tragical and fierce  cried   comrades  we are starving at the front  we are stiff with cold  we are dying for no reason  i ask the american comrades to carry word to america  that the russians will never give up their revolution until they die  we will hold the fort with all our strength until the peoples of the world rise and help us  tell the american workers to rise and fight for the social revolution    then came petrovsky  slight  slow voiced  implacable   now is the time for deeds  not words  the economic situation is bad  but we must get used to it  they are trying to starve us and freeze us  they are trying to provoke us  but let them know that they can go too far that if they dare to lay their hands upon the organisations of the proletariat we will sweep them away like scum from the face of the earth    the bolshevik press suddenly expanded  besides the two party papers   rabotchi put  and  soldat   soldier   there appeared a new paper for the peasants   derevenskaya byednota   village poorest   poured out in a daily half million edition  and on october 17th   rabotchi i soldat   its leading article summed up the bolshevik point of view   the fourth year s campaign will mean the annihilation of the army and the country     there is danger for the safety of petrograd     counter revolutionists rejoice in the people s misfortunes     the peasants brought to desperation come out in open rebellion  the landlords and government authorities massacre them with punitive expeditions  factories and mines are closing down  workmen are threatened with starvation     the bourgeoisie and its generals want to restore a blind discipline in the army     supported by the bourgeoisie  the kornilovtsi are openly getting ready to break up the meeting of the constituent assembly      the kerensky government is against the people  he will destroy the country     this paper stands for the people and by the people the poor classes  workers  soldiers and peasants  the people can only be saved by the completion of the revolution    and for this purpose the full power must be in the hands of the soviets      this paper advocates the following  all power to the soviets both in the capital and in the provinces   immediate truce on all fronts  an honest peace between peoples   landlord estates without compensation to the peasants   workers  control over industrial production   a faithfully and honestly elected constituent assembly   it is interesting to reproduce here a passage from that same paper the organ of those bolsheviki so well known to the world as german agents   the german kaiser  covered with the blood of millions of dead people  wants to push his army against petrograd  let us call to the german workmen  soldiers and peasants  who want peace not less than we do  to    stand up against this damned war   this can be done only by a revolutionary government  which would speak really for the workmen  soldiers and peasants of russia  and would appeal over the heads of the diplomats directly to the german troops  fill the german trenches with proclamations in the german language     our airmen would spread these proclamations all over germany      in the council of the republic the gulf between the two sides of the chamber deepened day by day    the propertied classes   cried karelin  for the left socialist revolutionaries   want to exploit the revolutionary machine of the state to bind russia to the war chariot of the allies  the revolutionary parties are absolutely against this policy       old nicholas tchaikovsky  representing the populist socialists  spoke against giving the land to the peasants  and took the side of the cadets   we must have immediately strong discipline in the army     since the beginning of the war i have not ceased to insist that it is a crime to undertake social and economic reforms in war time  we are committing that crime  and yet i am not the enemy of these reforms  because i am a socialist    cries from the left   we don t believe you   mighty applause from the right      adzhemov  for the cadets  declared that there was no necessity to tell the army what it was fighting for  since every soldier ought to realise that the first task was to drive the enemy from russian territory   kerensky himself came twice  to plead passionately for national unity  once bursting into tears at the end  the assembly heard him coldly  interrupting with ironical remarks   smolny institute  headquarters of the  tsay ee kah  and of the petrograd soviet  lay miles out on the edge of the city  beside the wide neva  i went there on a street car  moving snail like with a groaning noise through the cobbled  muddy streets  and jammed with people  at the end of the line rose the graceful smoke blue cupolas of smolny convent outlined in dull gold  beautiful  and beside it the great barracks like fa ade of smolny institute  two hundred yards long and three lofty stories high  the imperial arms carved hugely in stone still insolent over the entrance      under the old r gime a famous convent school for the daughters of the russian nobility  patronised by the tsarina herself  the institute had been taken over by the revolutionary organisations of workers and soldiers  within were more than a hundred huge rooms  white and bare  on their doors enamelled plaques still informing the passerby that within was  ladies  class room number 4  or  teachers  bureau   but over these hung crudely lettered signs  evidence of the vitality of the new order   central committee of the petrograd soviet  and   tsay ee kah   and  bureau of foreign affairs    union of socialist soldiers    central committee of the all russian trade unions    factory shop committees    central army committee   and the central offices and caucus rooms of the political parties      the long  vaulted corridors  lit by rare electric lights  were thronged with hurrying shapes of soldiers and workmen  some bent under the weight of huge bundles of newspapers  proclamations  printed propaganda of all sorts  the sound of their heavy boots made a deep and incessant thunder on the wooden floor     signs were posted up everywhere   comrades  for the sake of your health  preserve cleanliness   long tables stood at the head of the stairs on every floor  and on the landings  heaped with pamphlets and the literature of the different political parties  for sale      the spacious  low ceilinged refectory downstairs was still a dining room  for two rubles i bought a ticket entitling me to dinner  and stood in line with a thousand others  waiting to get to the long serving tables  where twenty men and women were ladling from immense cauldrons cabbage soup  hunks of meat and piles of  kasha   slabs of black bread  five kopeks paid for tea in a tin cup  from a basket one grabbed a greasy wooden spoon     the benches along the wooden tables were packed with hungry proletarians  wolfing their food  plotting  shouting rough jokes across the room        graphic page 33    text of placard in russian  translation follows   comrades for the sake of your health  preserve cleanliness   upstairs was another eating place  reserved for the  tsay ee kah   though every one went there  here could be had bread thickly buttered and endless glasses of tea      in the south wing on the second floor was the great hall of meetings  the former ball room of the institute  a lofty white room lighted by glazed white chandeliers holding hundreds of ornate electric bulbs  and divided by two rows of massive columns  at one end a dais  flanked with two tall many branched light standards  and a gold frame behind  from which the imperial portrait had been cut  here on festal occasions had been banked brilliant military and ecclesiastical uniforms  a setting for grand duchesses      just across the hall outside was the office of the credentials committee for the congress of soviets  i stood there watching the new delegates come in burly  bearded soldiers  workmen in black blouses  a few long haired peasants  the girl in charge a member of plekhanov s  yedinstvo      group smiled contemptuously   these are    see notes and explanations  very different people from the delegates to the first  siezd   congress    she remarked   see how rough and ignorant they look  the dark people      it was true  the depths of russia had been stirred  and it was the bottom which came uppermost now  the credentials committee  appointed by the old  tsay ee kah   was challenging delegate after delegate  on the ground that they had been illegally elected  karakhan  member of the bolshevik central committee  simply grinned   never mind   he said   when the time comes we ll see that you get your seats        rabotchi i soldat  said   the attention of delegates to the new all russian congress is called to attempts of certain members of the organising committee to break up the congress  by asserting that it will not take place  and that delegates had better leave petrograd     pay no attention to these lies     great days are coming      it was evident that a quorum would not come together by november 2  so the opening of the congress was postponed to the 7th  but the whole country was now aroused  and the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries  realising that they were defeated  suddenly changed their tactics and began to wire frantically to their provincial organisations to elect as many  moderate  socialist delegates as possible  at the same time the executive committee of the peasants  soviets issued an emergency call for a peasants  congress  to meet december 13th and offset whatever action the workers and soldiers might take     what would the bolsheviki do  rumours ran through the city that there would be an armed  demonstration   a  vystuplennie   coming out  of the workers and soldiers  the bourgeois and reactionary press prophesied insurrection  and urged the government to arrest the petrograd soviet  or at least to prevent the meeting of the congress  such sheets as  novaya rus  advocated a general bolshevik massacre   gorky s paper   novaya zhizn   agreed with the bolsheviki that the reactionaries were attempting to destroy the revolution  and that if necessary they must be resisted by force of arms  but all the parties of the revolutionary democracy must present a united front   as long as the democracy has not organised its principal forces  so long as the resistance to its influence is still strong  there is no advantage in passing to the attack  but if the hostile elements appeal to force  then the revolutionary democracy should enter the battle to seize the power  and it will be sustained by the most profound strata of the people      gorky pointed out that both reactionary and government newspapers were inciting the bolsheviki to violence  an insurrection  however  would prepare the way for a new kornilov  he urged the bolsheviki to deny the rumours  potressov  in the menshevik  dien   day   published a sensational story  accompanied by a map  which professed to reveal the secret bolshevik plan of campaign   as if by magic  the walls were covered with warnings   see app  ii  sect  10  proclamations  appeals  from the central committees of the  moderate  and conservative factions and the  tsay ee kah   denouncing any  demonstrations   imploring the workers and soldiers not to listen to agitators  for instance  this from the military section of the socialist revolutionary party   again rumours are spreading around the town of an intended  vystuplennie   what is the source of these rumours  what organisation authorises these agitators who preach insurrection  the bolsheviki  to a question addressed to them in the  tsay ee kah   denied that they have anything to do with it     but these rumours themselves carry with them a great danger  it may easily happen that  not taking into consideration the state of mind of the majority of the workers  soldiers and peasants  individual hot heads will call out part of the workers and soldiers on the streets  inciting them to an uprising     in this fearful time through which revolutionary russia is passing  any insurrection can easily turn into civil war  and there can result from it the destruction of all organisations of the proletariat  built up with so much labour     the counter revolutionary plotters are planning to take advantage of this insurrection to destroy the revolution  open the front to wilhelm  and wreck the constituent assembly     stick stubbornly to your posts  do not come out   on october 28th  in the corridors of smolny  i spoke with kameniev  a little man with a reddish pointed beard and gallic gestures  he was not at all sure that enough delegates would come   if there  is  a congress   he said   it will represent the overwhelming sentiment of the people  if the majority is bolshevik  as i think it will be  we shall demand that the power be given to the soviets  and the provisional government must resign       volodarsky  a tall  pale youth with glasses and a bad complexion  was more definite   the  lieber dans  and the other compromisers are sabotaging the congress  if they succeed in preventing its meeting  well  then we are realists enough not to depend on  that     under date of october 29th i find entered in my notebook the following items culled from the newspapers of the day   moghilev  general staff headquarters   concentration here of loyal guard regiments  the savage division  cossacks and death battalions   the  yunkers  of the officers  schools of pavlovsk  tsarskoye selo and peterhof ordered by the government to be ready to come to petrograd  oranienbaum  yunkers  arrive in the city   part of the armoured car division of the petrograd garrism stationed in the winter palace   upon orders signed by trotzky  several thousand rifles delivered by the government arms factory at sestroretzk to delegates of the petrograd workmen   at a meeting of the city militia of the lower liteiny quarter  a resolution demanding that all power be given to the soviets   this is just a sample of the confused events of those feverish days  when everybody knew that something was going to happen  but nobody knew just what   at a meeting of the petrograd soviet in smolny  the night of october 30th  trotzky branded the assertions of the bourgeois press that the soviet contemplated armed insurention as  an attempt of the reactionaries to discredit and wreck the congress of soviets     the petrograd soviet   he declared   had not ordered any  uystuplennie   if it is necessary we shall do so  and we will be supported by the petrogruad garrison     they  the government  are preparing a counter revolution  and we shall answer with an offensive which will be merciless and decisive    it is true that the petrograd soviet had not ordered a demonstration  but the central committee of the bolshevik party was considering the question of insurrection  all night long the 23d they met  there were present all the party intellectuals  the leaders and delegates of the petrograd workers and garrison  alone of the intellectuals lenin and trotzky stood for insurrection  even   urrection  even                the military men opposed it  a vote was taken  insurrection was defeated   then arose a rough workman  his face convulsed with rage   i speak for the petrograd proletariat   he said  harshly   we are in favour of insurrection  have it your own way  but i tell you now that if you allow the soviets to be destroyed   we re through with you    some soldiers joined him     and after that they voted again insurrection won      however  the right wing of the bolsheviki  led by riazanov  kameniev and zinoviev  continued to campaign against an armed rising  on the morning of october 31st appeared in  rabotchi put  the first instalment of lenin s  letter to the comrades    see app  ii  sect  11  one of the most audacious pieces of political propaganda the world has ever seen  in it lenin seriously presented the arguments in favour of insurrection  taking as text the objections of kameniev and riazonov    either we must abandon our slogan   all power to the soviets     he wrote   or else we must make an insurrection  there is no middle course       that same afternoon paul miliukov  leader of the cadets  made a brilliant  bitter speech  see app  ii  sect  12  in the council of the republic  branding the skobeliev  nakaz  as pro german  declaring that the  revolutionary democracy  was destroying russia  sneering at terestchenko  and openly declaring that he preferred german diplomacy to russian     the left benches were one roaring tumult all through      on its part the government could not ignore the significance of the success of the bolshevik propaganda  on the 29th joint commission of the government and the council of the republic hastily drew up two laws  one for giving the land temporarily to the peasants  and the other for pushing an energetic foreign policy of peace  the next day kerensky suspended capital punishment in the army  that same afternoon was opened with great ceremony the first session of the new  commission for strengthening the republican r gime and fighting against anarchy and counter revolution  of which history shows not the slightest further trace     the following morning with two other correspondents i interviewed kerensky  see app  ii  sect  13  the last time he received journalists    the russian people   he said  bitterly   are suffering from economic fatigue and from disillusionment with the allies  the world thinks that the russian revolution is at an end  do not be mistaken  the russian revolution is just beginning      words more prophetic  perhaps  than he knew   stormy was the all night meeting of the petrograd soviet the 30th of october  at which i was present  the  moderate  socialist intellectuals  officers  members of army committees  the  tsay ee kah   were there in force  against them rose up workmen  peasants and common soldiers  passionate and simple   a peasant told of the disorders in tver  which he said were caused by the arrest of the land committees   this kerensky is nothing but a shield to the  pomieshtchiki   landowners    he cried   they know that at the constituent assembly we will take the land anyway  so they are trying to destroy the constituent assembly    a machinist from the putilov works described how the superintendents were closing down the departments one by one on the pretext that there was no fuel or raw materials  the factory shop committee  he declared  had discovered huge hidden supplies    it is a  provocatzia    said he   they want to starve us or drive us to violence    among the soldiers one began   comrades  i bring you greetings from the place where men are digging their graves and call them trenches    then arose a tall  gaunt young soldier  with flashing eyes  met with a roar of welcome  it was tchudnovsky  reported killed in the july fighting  and now risen from the dead    the soldier masses no longer trust their officers  even the army committees  who refused to call a meeting of our soviet  betrayed us     the masses of the soldiers want the constituent assembly to be held exactly when it was called for  and those who dare to postpone it will be cursed and not only platonic curses either  for the army has guns too       he told of the electoral campaign for the constituent now raging in the fifth army   the officers  and especially the mensheviki and the socialist revolutionaries  are trying deliberately to cripple the bolsheviki  our papers are not allowed to circulate in the trenches  our speakers are arrested     why don t you speak about the lack of bread   shouted another soldier    man shall not live by bread alone   answered tchudnovsky  sternly      followed him an officer  delegate from the vitebsk soviet  a menshevik  oboronetz    it isn t the question of who has the power  the trouble is not with the government  but with the war     and the war must be won before any change   at this  hoots and ironical cheers   these bolshevik agitators are demagogues   the hall rocked with laughter   let us for a moment forget the class struggle   but he got no farther  a voice yelled   don t you wish we would    petrograd presented a curious spectacle in those days  in the factories the committe rooms were filled with stacks of rifles  couriers came and went  the red guard     drilled     in all the    see notes and explanations  barracks meetings every night  and all day long interminable hot arguments  on the streets the crowds thickened toward gloomy evening  pouring in slow voluble tides up and down the nevsky  fighting for the newspapers     hold ups increased to such an extent that it was dangerous to walk down side streets     on the sadovaya one afternoon i saw a crowd of several hundred people beat and trample to death a soldier caught stealing     mysterious individuals circulated around the shivering women who waited in  queue  long cold hours for bread and milk  whispering that the jews had cornered the food supply and that while the people starved  the soviet members lived luxuriously      at smolny there were strict guards at the door and the outer gates  demanding everybody s pass  the committee rooms buzzed and hummed all day and all night  hundreds of soldiers and workmen slept on the floor  wherever they could find room  upstairs in the great hall a thousand people crowded to the uproarious sessions of the petrograd soviet      gambling clubs functioned hectically from dusk to dawn  with champagne flowing and stakes of twenty thousand rubles  in the centre of the city at night prostitutes in jewels and expensive furs walked up and down  crowded the caf s      monarchist plots  german spies  smugglers hatching schemes      and in the rain  the bitter chill  the great throbbing city under grey skies rushing faster and faster toward what                                 chapter iii                                on the eve  in the relations of a weak government and a rebellious people there comes a time when every act of the authorities exasperates the masses  and every refusal to act excites their contempt      the proposal to abandon petrograd raised a hurricane  kerensky s public denial that the government had any such intention was met with hoots of derision   pinned to the wall by the pressure of the revolution  cried  rabotchi put    the government of  provisional  bourgeois tries to get free by giving out lying assurances that it never thought of fleeing from petrograd  and that it didn t wish to surrender the capital      in kharkov thirty thousand coal miners organised  adopting the preamble of the i  w  w  constitution   the working class and the employing class have nothing in common   dispersed by cossacks  some were locked out by the mine owners  and the rest declared a general strike  minister of commerce and industry konovalov appointed his assistant  orlov  with plenary powers  to settle the trouble  orlov was hated by the miners  but the  tsay ee kah  not only supported his appointment  but refused to demand that the cossacks be recalled from the don basin      this was followed by the dispersal of the soviet at kaluga  the bolsheviki  having secured a majority in the soviet  set free some political prisoners  with the sanction of the government commissar the municipal duma called in troops from minsk  and bombarded the soviet headquarters with artillery  the bolsheviki yielded  but as they left the building cossacks attacked them  crying   this is what we ll do to all the other bolshevik soviets  including those of moscow and petrograd   this incident sent a wave of panic rage throughout russia      in petrograd was ending a regional congress of soviets of the north  presided over by the bolshevik krylenko  by an immense majority it resolved that all power should be assumed by the all russian congress  and concluded by greeting the bolsheviki in prison  bidding them rejoice  for the hour of their liberation was at hand  at the same time the first all russian conference of factory shop committees  see app  iii  sect  1  declared emphatically for the soviets

of the commission for national defence  minister of war general verkhovsky  one of the principal persons responsible for the fall of kornilov  proposed to sign a separate peace  independently of the allies   that is treason to russia   terestchenko declared that the provisional government had not even examined verkhovsky s proposition    you might think   said terestchenko   that we were in a madhouse    the members of the commission were astounded at the general s words   general alexeyev wept   no  it is not madness  it is worse  it is direct treason to russia   kerensky  terestchenko and nekrassov must immediately answer us concerning the words of verkhovsky   citizens  arise   russia is being sold   save her   what verkhovsky really said was that the allies must be pressed to offer peace  because the russian army could fight no longer      both in russia and abroad the sensation was tremendous  verkhovsky was given  indefinite leave of absence for illhealth   and left the government   obshtchee dielo  was suppressed      sunday  november 4th  was designated as the day of the petrograd soviet  with immense meetings planned all over the city  ostensibly to raise money for the organisation and the press  really  to make a demonstration of strength  suddenly it was announced that on the same day the cossacks would hold a  krestny khod  procession of the cross in honour of the ikon of 1612  through whose miraculous intervention napoleon had been driven from moscow  the atmosphere was electric  a spark might kindle civil war  the petrograd soviet issued a manifesto  headed  brothers cossacks    you  cossacks  are being incited against us  workers and soldiers  this plan of cain is being put into operation by our common enemies  the oppressors  the privileged classes generals  bankers  landlords  former officials  former servants of the tsar     we are hated by all grafters  rich men  princes  nobles  generals  including your cossack generals

consciousness of every individual whether he will or will not take part in this procession  we do not interfere in this matter  nor do we obstruct anybody     however  we warn you  cossacks  look out and see to it that under the pretext of a  krestni khod   your kaledins do not instigate you against workmen  against soldiers      the procession was hastily called off      in the barracks and the working class quarters of the town the bolsheviki were preaching   all power to the soviets   and agents of the dark forces were urging the people to rise and slaughter the jews  shop keepers

audacious robberies and murders  and the criminals were unmolested   on the other hand armed workers patrolled the streets at night  doing battle with marauders and requisitioning arms wherever they found them   on the first of november colonel polkovnikov  military commander of petrograd  issued a proclamation   despite the difficult days through which the country is passing  irresponsible appeals to armed demonstrations and massacres are still being spread around petrograd  and from day to day robbery and disorder increase   this state of things is disorganising the life of the citizens  and hinders the systematic work of the government and the municipal institutions   in full consciousness of my responsibility and my duty before my country  i command   1  every military

had sufficient force to cope with any demonstration   see app  iii  sect  5  he accused  novaya rus  and  robotchi put  of both doing the same kind of subversive work   but owing to the absolute freedom of the press   he added   the government is not in a position to combat printed lies           declaring that these were two aspects of the same    this was not quite candid   the provisional gevernment had suppressed bolshevik papers before  in july  and was planning to do so again   propaganda  which had for its object the counter revolution  so ardently desired by the dark forces  he went on    i am a doomed man  it doesn t matter what happens to me  and i have the audacity to say that the other enigmatic part is that of the unbelievable provocation created in the city by the bolsheviki    on november 2d only fifteen delegates to the congress of soviets had arrived  next day there were a hundred  and the morning after that a hundred and seventy five  of whom one hundred and three were bolsheviki     four hundred constituted a quorum  and the congress was only three days off      i spent a great deal of time at smolny  it was no longer easy to get in  double rows of sentries guarded the outer gates  and once inside the front door there was a long line of people waiting to be let in  four at a time  to be questioned as to their identity and their business  passes were given out  and the pass system was changed every few hours  for spies continually sneaked through       graphic page 49  russian pass to reed  translation follows   pass to smolny institute

must at least have one little paper    trotzky was very patient   let me see the commandant   he said  the soldier hesitated  grumbling something about not wanting to disturb the commandant for every devil that came along  he beckoned finally to the soldier in command of the guard  trotzky explained matters to him   my name is trotzky   he repeated    trotzky   the other soldier scratched his head   i ve heard the name somewhere   he said at length   i guess it s all right  you can go on in  comrade       in the corridor i met karakhan  member of the bolshevik central committee  who explained to me what the new government would be like    a loose organisation  sensitive to the popular will as expressed through the soviets  allowing local forces full play  at present the provisional government obstructs the action of the local democratic will  just as the tsar s government did  the initiative of the new society shall come from below     the form of the government will be modelled on the constitution of the russian social democratic labour party  the new  tsay ee kah   responsible to frequent meetings of the all russian congress of soviets  will be the parliament  the various ministries will be headed by  collegia  committees instead of by ministers  and will be directly responsible to the soviets      on october 30th  by appointment  i went up to a small  bare room in the attic of smolny  to talk with trotzky  in the middle of the room he sat on a rough chair at a bare table  few questions from me were necessary  he talked rapidly and steadily  for more than an hour  the substance of his talk  in his own words  i give here    the provisional government is absolutely powerless  the bourgeoisie is in control  but this control is masked by a fictitious coalition with the  oborontsi  parties  now  during the revolution  one sees revolts of peasants who are tired of waiting for their promised land  and all over the country  in all the toiling classes  the same disgust is evident  this domination by the bourgeoisie is only possible by means of civil war  the kornilov method is the only way by which the bourgeoisie can control  but it is force which the bourgeoisie lacks     the army is with us  the conciliators and pacifists  socialist revolutionaries and mensheviki  have lost all authority because the struggle between the peasants and the landlords  between the workers and the employers  between the soldiers and the officers  has become more bitter  more irreconcilable than ever  only by the concerted action of the popular mass  only by the victory of proletarian dictatorship  can the revolution be achieved and the people saved       the soviets are the most perfect representatives of the people perfect in their revolutionary experience  in their ideas and objects  based directly upon the army in the trenches  the workers in the factories  and the peasants in the fields  they are the backbone of the revolution    there has been an attempt to create a power without the soviets and only powerlessness has been created  counter revolutionary schemes of all sorts are now being hatched in the corridors of the council of the russian republic  the cadet party represents the counter revolution militant  on the other side  the soviets represent the cause of the people  between the two camps there are no groups of serious importance     it is the  lutte finale   the bourgeois counter revolution organises all its forces and waits for the moment to attack us  our answer will be decisive  we will complete the work scarcely begun in march  and advanced during the kornilov affair       he went on to speak of the new government s foreign policy    our first act will be to call for an immediate armistice on all fronts  and a conference of peoples to discuss democratic peace terms  the quantity of democracy we get in the peace settlement depends on the quantity of revolutionary response there is in europe  if we create here a government of the soviets  that will be a powerful factor for immediate peace in europe  for this government will address itself directly and immediately to all peoples  over the heads of their governments  proposing an armistice  at the moment of the conclusion of peace the pressure of the russian revolution will be in the direction of  no annexations   no indemnities  the right of self determination of peoples   and a  federated republic of europe        at the end of this war i see europe recreated  not by the diplomats  but by the proletariat  the federated republic of europe the united states of europe that is what must be  national autonomy no longer suffices  economic evolution demands the abolition of national frontiers  if europe is to remain split into national groups  then imperialism will recommence its work  only a federated republic of europe can give peace to the world   he smiled that fine  faintly ironical smile of his   but without the action of the european masses  these ends cannot be realised now       now while everybody was waiting for the bolsheviki to appear suddenly on the streets one morning and begin to shoot down people with white collars on  the real insurrection took its way quite naturally and openly   the provisional government planned to send the petrograd garrison to the front   the petrograd garrison numbered about sixty thousand men  who had taken a prominent part in the revolution  it was they who had turned the tide in the great days of march  created the soviets of soldiers  deputies  and hurled back kornilov from the gates of petrograd   now a large part of them were bolsheviki  when the provisional government talked of evacuating the city  it was the petrograd garrison which answered   if you are not capable of defending the capital  conclude peace  if you cannot conclude peace  go away and make room for a people s government which can do both       it was evident that any attempt at insurrection depended upon the attitude of the petrograd garrison  the government s plan was to replace the garrison regiments with  dependable  troops cossacks  death battalions  the army committees  the  moderate  socialists and the  tsay ee kah  supported the government  a wide spread agitation was carried on at the front and in petrograd  emphasizing the fact that for eight months the petrograd garrison had been leading an easy life in the barracks of the capital  while their exhausted comrades in the trenches starved and died   naturally there was some truth in the accusation that the garrison regiments were reluctant to exchange their comparative comfort for the hardships of a winter campaign  but there were other reasons why they refused to go  the petrograd soviet feared the government s intentions  and from the front came hundreds of delegates  chosen by the common soldiers  crying   it is true we need reinforcements  but more important  we must know that petrograd and the revolution are well guarded     do you hold the rear  comrades  and we will hold the front    on october 25th  behind closed doors  the central committee of the petrograd soviet discussed the formation of a special military committee to decide the whole question  the next day a meeting of the soldiers  section of the petrograd soviet elected a committee  which immediately proclaimed a boycott of the bourgeois newspapers  and condemned the  tsay ee kah  for opposing the congress of soviets  on the 29th  in open session of the petrograd soviet  trotzky proposed that the soviet formally sanction the military revolutionary committee   we ought   he said   to create our special organisation to march to battle  and if necessary to die      it was decided to send to the front two delegations  one from the soviet and one from the garrison  to confer with the soldiers  committees and the general staff   at pskov  the soviet delegates were met by general tcheremissov  commander of the northern front  with the curt declaration that he had ordered the petrograd garrison to the trenches  and that was all  the garrison committee was not allowed to leave petrograd      a delegation of the soldiers  section of the petrograd soviet asked that a representative be admitted to the staff of the petrograd district  refused  the petrograd soviet demanded that no orders be issued without the approval of the soldiers  section  refused  the delegates were roughly told   we only recognise the  tsay ee kah   we do not recognise you  if you break any laws  we shall arrest you    on the 30th a meeting of representatives of all the petrograd regiments passed a resolution    the petrograd garrison no longer recognises the provisional government  the petrograd soviet is our government  we will obey only the orders of the petrograd soviet  through the military revolutionary committee    the local military units were ordered to wait for instructions from the soldiers  section of the petrograd soviet   next day the  tsay ee kah  summoned its own meeting  composed largely of officers  formed a committee to cooperate with the staff  and detailed commissars in all quarters of the city   a great soldier meeting at smolny on the 3d resolved   saluting the creation of the military revolutionary committee  the petrograd garrison promises it complete support in all its actions  to unite more closely the front and the rear in the interests of the revolution   the garrison moreover declares that with the revolutionary proletariat it assures the maintenance of revolutionary order in petrograd  every attempt at provocation on the part of the kornilovtsi or the bourgeoisie will be met with merciless resistance   now conscious of its power  the military revolutionary committee peremptorily summoned the petrograd staff to submit to its control  to all printing plants it gave orders not to publish any appeals or proclamations without the committee s authorisation  armed commissars visited the kronversk arsenal and seized great quantities of arms and ammunition  halting a shipment of ten thousand bayonets which was being sent to novotcherkask  headquarters of kaledin      suddenly awake to the danger  the government offered immunity if the committee would disband  too late  at midnight november 5th kerensky himself sent malevsky to offer the petrograd soviet representation on the staff  the military revolutionary committee accepted  an hour later general manikovsky  acting minister of war  countermanded the offer      tuesday morning  november 6th  the city was thrown into excitement by the appearance of a placard signed   military revolutionary committee attached to the petrograd soviet of workers  and soldiers  deputies    to the population of petrograd  citizens   counter revolution has raised its criminal head  the kornilovtsi are mobilising their forces in order to crush the all russian congress of soviets and break the constituent assembly  at the same time the  pogromists  may attempt to call upon the people of petrograd for trouble and bloodshed  the petrograd soviet of workers  and soldiers  deputies takes upon itself the guarding of revolutionary order in the city against counter revolutionary and  pogrom  attempts   the petrograd garrison will not allow any violence or disorders  the population is invited to arrest hooligans and black hundred agitators and take them to the soviet commissars at the nearest barracks  at the first attempt of the dark forces to make trouble on the streets of petrograd  whether robbery or fighting  the criminals will be wiped off the face of the earth   citizens  we call upon you to maintain complete quiet and self possession  the cause of order and revolution is in strong hands   list of regiments where there are commissars of the military revolutionary committee      on the 3rd the leaders of the bolsheviki had another historic meeting behind closed doors  notified by zalkind  i waited in the corridor outside the door  and volodarsky as he came out told me what was going on   lenin spoke   november 6th will be too early  we must have an all russian basis for the rising  and on the 6th all the delegates to the congress will not have arrived     on the other hand  november 8th will be too late  by that time the congress will be organised  and it is difficult for a large organised body of people to take swift  decisive action  we must act on the 7th  the day the congress meets  so that we may say to it   here is the power  what are you going to do with it     in a certain upstairs room sat a thin faced  long haired individual  once an officer in the armies of the tsar  then revolutionist and exile  a certain avseenko  called antonov  mathematician and chess player  he was drawing careful plans for the seizure of the capital   on its side the government was preparing  inconspicuously certain of the most loyal regiments  from widely separated divisions  were ordered to petrograd  the  yunker  artillery was drawn into the winter palace  patrols of cossacks made their appearance in the streets  for the first time since the july days  polkovnikov issued order after order  threatening to repress all insubordination with the  utmost energy   kishkin  minister of public instruction  the worsthated member of the cabinet  was appointed special commissar to keep order in petrograd  he named as assistants two men no less unpopular  rutenburg and paltchinsky  petrograd  cronstadt and finland were declared in a state of siege upon which the bourgeois  novoye vremya   new times  remarked ironically   why the state of siege  the government is no longer a power  it has no moral authority and it does not possess the necessary apparatus to use force     in the most favourable circumstances it can only negotiate with any one who consents to parley  its authority goes no farther      monday morning  the 5th  i dropped in at the marinsky palace  to see what was happening in the council of the russian republic  bitter debate on terestchenko s foreign policy  echoes of the burtzev verkhovski affair  all the diplomats present except the italian ambassador  who everybody said was prostrated by the carso disaster      as i came in  the left socialist revolutionary karelin was reading aloud an editorial from the london  times  which said   the remedy for bolshevism is bullets   turning to the cadets he cried   that s what  you  think  too    voices from the right   yes  yes     yes  i know you think so   answered karelin  hotly   but you haven t the courage to try it    then skobeliev  looking like a matin e idol with his soft blond beard and wavy yellow hair  rather apologetically defending the soviet  nakaz   terestchenko followed  assailed from the left by cries of  resignation  resignation   he insisted that the delegates of the government and of the  tsay ee kah  to paris should have a common point of view his own  a few words about the restoration of discipline in the army  about war to victory     tumult  and over the stubborn opposition of the truculent left  the council of the republic passed to the simple order of the day   there stretched the rows of bolshevik seats empty since that first day when they left the council  carrying with them so much life  as i went down the stairs it seemed to me that in spite of the bitter wrangling  no real voice from the rough world outside could penetrate this high  cold hall  and that the provisional government was wrecked on the same rock of war and peace that had wrecked the miliukov ministry     the doorman grumbled as he put on my coat   i don t know what is becoming of poor russia  all these mensheviki and bolsheviki and trudoviki     this ukraine and this finland and the german imperialists and the english imperialists  i am forty five years old  and in all my life i never heard so many words as in this place       in the corridor i met professor shatsky  a rat faced individual in a dapper frock coat  very influential in the councils of the cadet party  i asked him what he thought of the much talked of bolshevik  vystuplennie   he shrugged  sneering    they are cattle  canaille    he answered   they will not dare  or if they dare they will soon be sent flying  from our point of view it will not be bad  for then they will ruin themselves and have no power in the constituent assembly       but  my dear sir  allow me to outline to you my plan for a form of government to be submitted to the constituent assembly  you see  i am chairman of a commission appointed from this body  in conjunction with the provisional government  to work out a constitutional project     we will have a legislative assembly of two chambers  such as you have in the united states  in the lower chamber will be territorial representatives  in the upper  representatives of the liberal professions  zemstvos  cooperatives and trade unions       outside a chill  damp wind came from the west  and the cold mud underfoot soaked through my shoes  two companies of  yunkers  passed swinging up the morskaya  tramping stiffly in their long coats and singing an oldtime crashing chorus  such as the soldiers used to sing under the tsar     at the first cross street i noticed that the city militiamen were mounted  and armed with revolvers in bright new holsters  a little group of people stood silently staring at them  at the corner of the nevsky i bought a pamphlet by lenin   will the bolsheviki be able to hold the power   paying for it with one of the stamps which did duty for small change  the usual street cars crawled past  citizens and soldiers clinging to the outside in a way to make theodore p  shonts green with envy     along the sidewalk a row of deserters in uniform sold cigarettes and sunflower seeds      up the nevsky in the sour twilight crowds were battling for the latest papers  and knots of people were trying to make out the multitudes of appeals  see app  iii  sect  6  and proclamations pasted in every flat place  from the  tsay ee kah   the peasants  soviets  the  moderate  socialist parties  the army committees threatening  cursing  beseeching the workers and soldiers to stay home  to support the government      an armoured automobile went slowly up and down  siren screaming  on every corner  in every open space  thick groups were clustered  arguing soldiers and students  night came swiftly down  the wide spaced street lights flickered on  the tides of people flowed endlessly     it is always like that in petrograd just before trouble      the city was nervous  starting at every sharp sound  but still no sign from the bolsheviki  the soldiers stayed in the barracks  the workmen in the factories     we went to a moving picture show near the kazan cathedral a bloody italian film of passion and intrigue  down front were some soldiers and sailors  staring at the screen in childlike wonder  totally unable to comprehend why there should be so much violent running about  and so much homicide      from there i hurried to smolny  in room 10 on the top floor  the military revolutionary committee sat in continuous session  under the chairmanship of a tow headed  eighteen year old boy named lazimir  he stopped  as he passed  to shake hands rather bashfully    peter paul fortress has just come over to us   said he  with a pleased grin   a minute ago we got word from a regiment that was ordered by the government to come to petrograd  the men were suspicious  so they stopped the train at gatchina and sent a delegation to us   what s the matter   they asked   what have you got to say  we have just passed a resolution   all power to the soviets       the military revolutionary committee sent back word   brothers  we greet you in the name of the revolution  stay where you are until further instructions     all telephones  he said  were cut off  but communication with the factories and barracks was established by means of military telephonograph apparatus      a steady stream of couriers and commissars came and went  outside the door waited a dozen volunteers  ready to carry word to the farthest quarters of the city  one of them  a gypsy faced man in the uniform of a lieutenant  said in french   everything is ready to move at the push of a button       there passed podvoisky  the thin  bearded civillian whose brain conceived the strategy of insurrection  antonov  unshaven  his collar filthy  drunk with loss of sleep  krylenko  the squat  wide faced soldier  always smiling  with his violent gestures and tumbling speech  and dybenko  the giant bearded sailor with the placid face  these were the men of the hour and of other hours to come   downstairs in the office of the factory shop committees sat seratov  signing orders on the government arsenal for arms one hundred and fifty rifles for each factory     delegates waited in line  forty of them      in the hall i ran into some of the minor bolshevik leaders  one showed me a revolver   the game is on   he said  and his face was pale   whether we move or not the other side knows it must finish us or be finished       the petrograd soviet was meeting day and night  as i came into the great hall trotzky was just finishing    we are asked   he said   if we intend to have a  vystuplennie   i can give a clear answer to that question  the petrograd soviet feels that at last the moment has arrived when the power must fall into the hands of the soviets  this transfer of government will be accomplished by the all russian congress  whether an armed demonstration is necessary will depend on    those who wish to interfere with the all russian congress       we feel that our government  entrusted to the personnel of the provisional cabinet  is a pitiful and helpless government  which only awaits the sweep of the broom of history to give way to a really popular government  but we are trying to avoid a conflict  even now  to day  we hope that the all russian congress will take    into its hands that power and authority which rests upon the organised freedom of the people  if  however  the government wants to utilise the short period it is expected to live twenty four  forty eight  or seventy two hours to attack us  then we shall answer with counter attacks  blow for blow  steel for iron    amid cheers he announced that the left socialist revolutionaries had agreed to send representatives into the military revolutionary committee      as i left smolny  at three o clock in the morning  i noticed that two rapid firing guns had been mounted  one on each side of the door  and that strong patrols of soldiers guarded the gates and the near by street corners  bill shatov     came bounding up the steps   well   he    well known in the american labor movement   cried   we re off  kerensky sent the  yunkers  to close down our papers   soldat  and  rabotchi put   but our troops went down and smashed the government seals  and now we re sending detachments to seize the bourgeois newspaper offices   exultantly he slapped me on the shoulder  and ran in      on the morning of the 6th i had business with the censor  whose office was in the ministry of foreign affairs  everywhere  on all the walls  hysterical appeals to the people to remain  calm   polkovnikov emitted  prikaz  after  prikaz    i order all military units and detachments to remain in their barracks until further orders from the staff of the military district     all officers who act without orders from their superiors will be court martialled for mutiny  i forbid absolutely any execution by soldiers of instructions from other organisations      the morning papers announced that the government had suppressed the papers  novaya rus  zhivoye slovo  rabotchi put  and  soldat   and decreed the arrest of the leaders of the petrograd soviet and the members of the military revolutionary committee      as i crossed the palace square several batteries of  yunker  artillery came through the red arch at a jingling trot  and drew up before the palace  the great red building of the general staff was unusually animated  several armoured automobiles ranked before the door  and motors full of officers were coming and going     the censor was very much excited  like a small boy at a circus  kerensky  he said  had just gone to the council of the republic to offer his resignation  i hurried down to the marinsky palace  arriving at the end of that passionate and almost incoherent speech of kerensky s  full of self justification and bitter denunciation of his enemies    i will cite here the most characteristic passage from a whole series of articles published in  rabotchi put  by ulianov lenin  a state criminal who is in hiding and whom we are trying to find     this state criminal has invited the proletariat and the petrograd garrison to repeat the experience of the 16th 18th of july  and insists upon the immediate necessity for an armed rising     moreover  other bolshevik leaders have taken the floor in a series of meetings  and also made an appeal to immediate insurrection  particularly should be noticed the activity of the present president of the petrograd soviet  bronstein trotzky       i ought to bring to your notice    that the expressions and the style of a whole series of articles in  rabotchi put  and  soldat  resemble absolutely those of  novaya rus      we have to do not so much with the movement of such and such political party  as with the exploitation of the political ignorance and criminal instincts of a part of the population  a sort of organisation whose object it is to provoke in russia  cost what it may  an inconscient movement of destruction and pillage  for given the state of mind of the masses  any movement at petrograd will be followed by the most terrible massacres  which will cover with eternal shame the name of free russia           by the admission of ulianov lenin himself  the situation of the extreme left wing of the social democrats in russia is very favourable    here kerensky read the following quotation from lenin s article     think of it     the german comrades have only one liebknecht  without newspapers  without freedom of meeting  without a soviet     they are opposed by the incredible hostility of all classes of society and yet the german comrades try to act  while we  having dozens of newspapers  freedom of meeting  the majority of the soviets  we  the best placed international proletarians of the entire world  can we refuse to support the german revolutionists and insurrectionary organisations      kerensky then continued    the organisers of rebellion recognise thus implicitly that the most perfect conditions for the free action of a political party obtain now in russia  administered by a provisional government at the head of which is  in the eyes of this party   a usurper and a man who has sold himself to the bourgeoisie  the minister president kerensky            the organisers of the insurrection do not come to the aid of the german proletariat  but of the german governing classes  and they open the russian front to the iron fists of wilhelm and his friends     little matter to the provisional government the motives of these people  little matter if they act consciously or unconsciously  but in any case  from this tribune  in full consciousness of my responsibility  i quality such acts of a russian political party as acts of treason to russia        i place myself at the point of view of the right  and i propose immediately to proceed to an investigation and make the necessary arrests    uproar from the left    listen to me   he cried in a powerful voice   at the moment when the state is in danger  because of conscious or unconscious treason  the provisional government  and myself among others  prefer to be killed rather than betray the life  the honour and the independence of russia       at this moment a paper was handed to kerensky    i have just received the proclamation which they are distributing to the regiments  here is the contents   reading     the petrograd soviet of workers  and soldiers  deputies is menaced  we order immediately the regiments to mobilise on a war footing and to await new orders  all delay or non execution of this order will be considered as an act of treason to the revolution  the military revolutionary committee  for the president  podvoisky  the secretary  antonov      in reality  this is an attempt to raise the populace against the existing order of things  to break the constituent and to open the front to the regiments of the iron fist of wilhelm       i say  populace  intentionally  because the conscious democracy and its  tsay ee kah   all the army organisations  all that free russia glorifies  the good sense  the honour and the conscience of the great russian democracy  protests against these things       i have not come here with a prayer  but to state my firm conviction that the provisional government  which defends at this moment our new liberty that the new russian state  destined to a brilliant future  will find unanimous support except among those who have never dared to face the truth           the provisional government has never violated the liberty of all citizens of the state to use their political rights     but now the provisional government     declares  in this moment those elements of the russian nation  those groups and parties who have dared to lift their hands against the free will of the russian people  at the same time threatening to open the front to germany  must be liquidated with decision       let the population of petrograd understand that it will encounter a firm power  and perhaps at the last moment good sense  conscience and honour will triumph in the hearts of those who still possess them       all through this speech  the hall rang with deafening clamour  when the minister president had stepped down  pale faced and wet with perspiration  and strode out with his suite of officers  speaker after speaker from the left and centre attacked the right  all one angry roaring  even the socialist revolutionaries  through gotz    the policy of the bolsheviki is demagogic and criminal  in their exploitation of the popular discontent  but there is a whole series of popular demands which have received no satisfaction up to now     the questions of peace  land and the democratization of the army ought to be stated in such a fashion that no soldier  peasant or worker would have the least doubt that our government is attempting  firmly and infallibly  to solve them       we mensheviki do not wish to provoke a cabinet crisis  and we are ready to defend the provisional government with all our energy  to the last drop of our blood if only the provisional government  on all these burning questions  will speak the clear and precise words awaited by the people with such impatience       then martov  furious    the words of the minister president  who allowed himself to speak of  populace  when it is question of the movement of important sections of the proletariat and the army although led in the wrong direction are nothing but an incitement to civil war    the order of the day proposed by the left was voted  it amounted practically to a vote of lack of confidence   1  the armed demonstration which has been preparing for some days past has for its object a  coup d etat   threatens to provoke civil war  creates conditions favourable to  pogroms  and counterrevolution  the mobilization of counter revolutionary forces  such as the black hundreds  which will inevitably bring about the impossibility of convoking the constituent  will cause a military catastrophe  the death of the revolution  paralyse the economic life of the country and destroy russia   2  the conditions favourable to this agitation have been created by delay in passing urgent measures  as well as objective conditions caused by the war and the general disorder  it is necessary before everything to promulgate at once a decree transmitting the land to the peasants  land committees  and to adopt an energetic course of action abroad in proposing to the allies to proclaim their peace terms and to begin peace parleys   3  to cope with monarchist manifestations and  pogromist  movements  it is indispensable to take immediate measures to suppress these movements  and for this purpose to create at petrograd a committee of public safety  composed of representatives of the municipality and the organs of the revolutionary democracy  acting in contact with the provisional government      it is interesting to note that the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries all rallied to this resolution     when kerensky saw it  however  he summoned avksentiev to the winter palace to explain  if it expressed a lack of confidence in the provisional government  he begged avksentiev to form a new cabinet  dan  gotz and avksentiev  the leaders of the  compromisers   performed their last compromise     they explained to kerensky that it was not meant as a criticism of the government   at the corner of the morskaya and the nevsky  squads of soldiers with fixed bayonets were stopping all private automobiles  turning out the occupants  and ordering them toward the winter palace  a large crowd had gathered to watch them  nobody knew whether the soldiers belonged to the government or the military revolutionary committee  up in front of the kazan cathedral the same thing was happening  machines being directed back up the nevsky  five or six sailors with rifles came along  laughing excitedly  and fell into conversation with two of the soldiers  on the sailors  hat bands were  avrora  and  zaria svobody   the names of the leading bolshevik cruisers of the baltic fleet  one of them said   cronstadt is coming      it was as if  in 1792  on the streets of paris  some one had said   the marseillais are coming   for at cronstadt were twenty five thousand sailors  convinced bolsheviki and not afraid to die       rabotchi i soldat  was just out  all its front page one huge proclamation  soldiers  workers  citizens   the enemies of the people passed last night to the offensive  the kornilovists of the staff are trying to draw in from the suburbs  yunkers  and volunteer battalions  the oranienbaum  yunkers  and the tsarskoye selo volunteers refused to come out  a stroke of high treason is being contemplated against the petrograd soviet     the campaign of the counter revolutionists is being directed against the all russian congress of soviets on the eve of its opening  against the constituent assembly  against the people  the petrograd soviet is guarding the revolution  the military revolutionary committee is directing the repulse of the conspirators  attack  the entire garrison and proletariat of petrograd are ready to deal the enemy of the people a crushing blow   the military revolutionary committee decrees   1  all regimental  division and battle ship committees  together with the soviet commissars  and all revolutionary organisations  shall meet in continuous session  concentrating in their hands all information about the plans of the conspirators   2  not one soldier shall leave his division without permission of the committee   3  to send to smolny at once two delegates from each military unit and five from each ward soviet   4  all members of the petrograd soviet and all delegates to the all russian congress are invited immediately to smolny for an extraordinary meeting   counter revolution has raised its criminal head   a great danger threatens all the conquests and hopes of the soldiers and workers   but the forces of the revolution by far exceed those of its enemies   the cause of the people is in strong hands  the conspirators will be crushed   no hesitation or doubts  firmness  steadfastness  discipline  determination   long live the revolution    the military revolutionary committee    the petrograd soviet was meeting continuously at smolny  a centre of storm  delegates falling down asleep on the floor and rising again to take part in the debate  trotzky  kameniev  volodarsky speaking six  eight  twelve hours a day      i went down to room 18 on the first floor where the bolshevik delegates were holding caucus  a harsh voice steadily booming  the speaker hidden by the crowd   the compromisers say that we are isolated  pay no attention to them  once it begins they must be dragged along with us  or else lose their following       here he held up a piece of paper   we are dragging them  a message has just come from the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries  they say that they condemn our action  but that if the government attacks us they will not oppose the cause of the proletariat   exultant shouting      as night fell the great hall filled with soldiers and workmen  a monstrous dun mass  deep humming in a blue haze of smoke  the old  tsay ee kah  had finally decided to welcome the delegates to that new congress which would mean its own ruin and perhaps the ruin of the revolutionary order it had built  at this meeting  however  only members of the  tsay ee kah  could vote      it was after midnight when gotz took the chair and dan rose to speak  in a tense silence  which seemed to me almost menacing    the hours in which we live appear in the most tragic colours   he said   the enemy is at the gates of petrograd  the forces of the democracy are trying to organise to resist him  and yet we await bloodshed in the streets of the capital  and famine threatens to destroy  not only our homogeneous government  but the revolution itself       the masses are sick and exhausted  they have no interest in the revolution  if the bolsheviki start anything  that will be the end of the revolution      cries   that s a lie     the counter revolutionists are waiting with the bolsheviki to begin riots and massacres     if there is any  vystuplennie   there will be no constituent assembly       cries   lie  shame      it is inadmissible that in the zone of military operations the petrograd garrison shall not submit to the orders of the staff     you must obey the orders of the staff and of the  tsay ee kah  elected by you  all power to the soviets that means death  robbers and thieves are waiting for the moment to loot and burn     when you have such slogans put before you   enter the houses  take away the shoes and clothes from the bourgeoisie     tumult  cries   no such slogan  a lie  a lie     well  it may start differently  but it will end that way    the  tsay ee kah  has full power to act  and must be obeyed     we are not afraid of bayonets     the  tsay ee kah  will defend the revolution with its body       cries   it was a dead body long ago     immense continued uproar  in which his voice could be heard screaming  as he pounded the desk   those who are urging this are committing a crime    voice   you committed a crime long ago  when you captured the power and turned it over to the bourgeoisie    gotz  ringing the chairman s bell   silence  or i ll have you put out    voice   try it    cheers and whistling     now concerning our policy about peace    laughter    unfortunately russia can no longer support the continuation of the war  there is going to be peace  but not permanent peace not a democratic peace     to day  at the council of the republic  in order to avoid bloodshed  we passed an order of the day demanding the surrender of the land to the land committees and immediate peace negotiations       laughter  and cries   too late     then for the bolsheviki  trotzky mounted the tribune  borne on a wave of roaring applause that burst into cheers and a rising house  thunderous  his thin  pointed face was positively mephistophelian in its expression of malicious irony    dan s tactics prove that the masses the great  dull  indifferent masses are absolutely with him    titantic mirth   he turned toward the chairman  dramatically   when we spoke of giving the land to the peasants  you were against it  we told the peasants   if they don t give it to you  take it yourselves   and the peasants followed our advice  and now you advocate what we did six months ago       i don t think kerensky s order to suspend the death penalty in the army was dictated by his ideals  i think kerensky was persuaded by the petrograd garrison  which refused to obey him       to day dan is accused of having made a speech in the council of the republic which proves him to be a secret bolshevik     the time may come when dan will say that the flower of the revolution participated in the rising of july 16th and 18th     in dan s resolution to day at the council of the republic there was no mention of enforcing discipline in the army  although that is urged in the propaganda of his party       no  the history of the last seven months shows that the masses have left the mensheviki  the mensheviki and the socialist revolutionaries conquered the cadets  and then when they got the power  they gave it to the cadets       dan tells you that you have no right to make an insurrection  insurrection is the right of all revolutionists  when the down trodden masses revolt  it is their right       then the long faced  cruel tongued lieber  greeted with groans and laughter    engels and marx said that the proletariat had no right to take power until it was ready for it  in a bourgeois revolution like this     the seizure of power by the masses means the tragic end of the revolution     trotzky  as a social democratic theorist  is himself opposed to what he is now advocating       cries   enough  down with him     martov  constantly interrupted   the internationalists are not opposed to the transmission of power to the democracy  but they disapprove of the methods of the bolsheviki  this is not the moment to seize the power       again dan took the floor  violently protesting against the action of the military revolutionary committee  which had sent a commissar to seize the office of  izviestia  and censor the paper  the wildest uproar followed  martov tried to speak  but could not be heard  delegates of the army and the baltic fleet stood up all over the hall  shouting that the soviet was  their  government      amid the wildest confusion ehrlich offered a resolution  appealing to the workers and soldiers to remain calm and not to respond to provocations to demonstrate  recognising the necessity of immediately creating a committee of public safety  and asking the provisional government at once to pass decrees transferring the land to the peasants and beginning peace negotiations      then up leaped volodarsky  shouting harshly that the  tsay ee kah   on the eve of the congress  had no right to assume the functions of the congress  the  tsay ee kah  was practically dead  he said  and the resolution was simply a trick to bolster up its waning power       as for us  bolsheviki  we will not vote on this resolution   whereupon all the bolsheviki left the hall and the resolution was passed      toward four in the morning i met zorin in the outer hall  a rifle slung from his shoulder    we re moving    see app  iii  sect  7  said he  calmly but with satisfaction   we pinched the assistant minister of justice and the minister of religions  they re down cellar now  one regiment is on the march to capture the telephone exchange  another the telegraph agency  another the state bank  the red guard is out       on the steps of smolny  in the chill dark  we first saw the red guard a huddled group of boys in workmen s clothes  carrying guns with bayonets  talking nervously together   far over the still roofs westward came the sound of scattered rifle fire  where the  yunkers  were trying to open the bridges over the neva  to prevent the factory workers and soldiers of the viborg quarter from joining the soviet forces in the centre of the city  and the cronstadt sailors were closing them again      behind us great smolny  bright with lights  hummed like a gigantic hive                                    chapter iv                      the fall of the provisional government  wednesday  november 7th  i rose very late  the noon cannon boomed from peter paul as i went down the nevsky  it was a raw  chill day  in front of the state bank some soldiers with fixed bayonets were standing at the closed gates    what side do you belong to   i asked   the government     no more government   one answered with a grin    slava bogu   glory to god   that was all i could get out of him      the street cars were running on the nevsky  men  women and small boys hanging on every projection  shops were open  and there seemed even less uneasiness among the street crowds than there had been the day before  a whole crop of new appeals against insurrection had blossomed out on the walls during the night to the peasants  to the soldiers at the front  to the workmen of petrograd  one read   from the petrograd municipal duma   the municipal duma informs the citizens that in the extraordinary meeting of november 6th the duma formed a committee of public safety  composed of members of the central and ward dumas  and representatives of the following revolutionary democratic organizations  the  tsay ee kah   the all russian executive committee of peasant deputies  the army organisations  the  tsentroflot   the petrograd soviet of workers  and soldiers  deputies      the council of trade unions  and others   members of the committee of public safety will be on duty in the building of the municipal duma  telephones no  15 40  223 77  138 36   november 7th  1917   though i didn t realize it then  this was the duma s declaration of war against the bolsheviki   i bought a copy of  rabotchi put   the only newspaper which seemed on sale  and a little later paid a soldier fifty kopeks for a second hand copy of  dien   the bolshevik paper  printed on large sized sheets in the conquered office of the  russkaya volia   had huge headlines   all power to the soviets of workers  soldiers and peasants  peace  bread  land   the leading article was signed  zinoviev   lenin s companion in hiding  it began   every soldier  every worker  every real socialist  every honest democrat realises that there are only two alternatives to the present situation   either the power will remain in the hands of the bourgeois landlord crew  and this will mean every kind of repression for the workers  soldiers and peasants  continuation of the war  inevitable hunger and death      or the power will be transferred to the hands of the revolutionary workers  soldiers and peasants  and in that case it will mean a complete abolition of landlord tyranny  immediate check of the capitalists  immediate proposal of a just peace  then the land is assured to the peasants  then control of industry is assured to the workers  then bread is assured to the hungry  then the end of this nonsensical war       dien  contained fragmentary news of the agitated night  bolsheviki capture of the telephone exchange  the baltic station  the telegraph agency  the peterhof  yunkers  unable to reach petrograd  the cossacks undecided  arrest of some of the ministers  shooting of chief of the city militia meyer   arrests  counter arrests  skirmishes between clashing patrols of soldiers   yunkers  and red guards   see app  iv  sect  1   on the corner of the morskaya i ran into captain gomberg  menshevik  oboronetz   secretary of the military section of his party  when i asked him if the insurrection had really happened he shrugged his shoulders in a tired manner and replied    tchort znayet   the devil knows  well  perhaps the bolsheviki can seize the power  but they won t be able to hold it more than three days  they haven t the men to run a government  perhaps it s a good thing to let them try that will furnish them       the military hotel at the corner of st  isaac s square was picketed by armed sailors  in the lobby were many of the smart young officers  walking up and down or muttering together  the sailors wouldn t let them leave      suddenly came the sharp crack of a rifle outside  followed by a scattered burst of firing  i ran out  something unusual was going on around the marinsky palace  where the council of the russian republic met  diagonally across the wide square was drawn a line of soldiers  rifles ready  staring at the hotel roof     provacatzia   shot at us   snapped one  while another went running toward the door   at the western corner of the palace lay a big armoured car with a red flag flying from it  newly lettered in red paint   s r s d     soviet rabotchikh soldatskikh deputatov    all the guns trained toward st  isaac s  a barricade had been heaped up across the mouth of novaya ulitza boxes  barrels  an old bed spring  a wagon  a pile of lumber barred the end of the moika quay  short logs from a neighbouring wood pile were being built up along the front of the building to form breastworks       is there going to be any fighting   i asked    soon  soon   answered a soldier  nervously   go away  comrade  you ll get hurt  they will come from that direction   pointing toward the admiralty    who will     that i couldn t tell you  brother   he answered  and spat   before the door of the palace was a crowd of soldiers and sailors  a sailor was telling of the end of the council of the russian republic   we walked in there   he said   and filled all the doors with comrades  i went up to the counter revolutionist kornilovitz who sat in the president s chair   no more council   i says   run along home now                                                          there was laughter  by waving assorted papers i managed to get around to the door of the press gallery  there an enormous smiling sailor stopped me  and when i showed my pass  just said   if you were saint michael himself  comrade  you couldn t pass here   through the glass of the door i made out the distorted face and gesticulating arms of a french correspondent  locked in      around in front stood a little  grey moustached man in the uniform of a general  the centre of a knot of soldiers  he was very red in the face    i am general alexeyev   he cried   as your superior officer and as a member of the council of the republic i demand to be allowed to pass   the guard scratched his head  looking uneasily out of the corner of his eye  he beckoned to an approaching officer  who grew very agitated when he saw who it was and saluted before he realised what he was doing     vashe vuisokoprevoskhoditelstvo  your high excellency   he stammered  in the manner of the old r gime   access to the palace is strictly forbidden  i have no right    an automobile came by  and i saw gotz sitting inside  laughing apparently with great amusement  a few minutes later another  with armed soldiers on the front seat  full of arrested members of the provisional government  peters  lettish member of the military revolutionary committee  came hurrying across the square    i thought you bagged all those gentlemen last night   said i  pointing to them    oh   he answered  with the expression of a disappointed small boy   the damn fools let most of them go again before we made up our minds       down the voskressensky prospect a great mass of sailors were drawn up  and behind them came marching soldiers  as far as the eye could reach   we went toward the winter palace by way of the admiralteisky  all the entrances to the palace square were closed by sentries  and a cordon of troops stretched clear across the western end  besieged by an uneasy throng of citizens  except for far away soldiers who seemed to be carrying wood out of the palace courtyard and piling it in front of the main gateway  everything was quiet   we couldn t make out whether the sentries were pro government or pro soviet  our papers from smolny had no effect  however  so we approached another part of the line with an important air and showed our american passports  saying  official business   and shouldered through  at the door of the palace the same old  shveitzari   in their brass buttoned blue uniforms with the red and gold collars  politely took our coats and hats  and we went up stairs  in the dark  gloomy corridor  stripped of its tapestries  a few old attendants were lounging about  and in front of kerensky s door a young officer paced up and down  gnawing his moustache  we asked if we could interview the minister president  he bowed and clicked his heels    no  i am sorry   he replied in french   alexander feodorvitch is extremely occupied just now      he looked at us for a moment   in fact  he is not here        where is he     he has gone to the front   see app  iv  sect  2  and do you know  there wasn t enough gasoline for his automobile  we had to send to the english hospital and borrow some     are the ministers here     they are meeting in some room i don t know where     are the bolsheviki coming     of course  certainly  they are coming  i expect a telephone call every minute to say that they are coming  but we are ready  we have  yunkers  in the front of the palace  through that door there     can we go in there     no  certainly not  it is not permitted   abruptly he shook hands all around and walked away  we turned to the forbidden door  set in a temporary partition dividing the hall and locked on the outside  on the other side were voices  and somebody laughing  except for that the vast spaces of the old palace were silent as the grave  an old  shveitzar  ran up   no   barin   you must not go in there     why is the door locked     to keep the soldiers in   he answered  after a few minutes he said something about having a glass of tea and went back up the hall  we unlocked the door   just inside a couple of soldiers stood on guard  but they said nothing  at the end of the corridor was a large  ornate room with gilded cornices and enormous crystal lustres  and beyond it several smaller ones  wainscoted with dark wood  on both sides of the parquetted floor lay rows of dirty mattresses and blankets  upon which occasional soldiers were stretched out  everywhere was a litter of cigarette butts  bits of bread  cloth  and empty bottles with expensive french labels  more and more soldiers  with the red shoulder straps of the  yunker  schools  moved about in a stale atmosphere of tobacco smoke and unwashed humanity  one had a bottle of white burgundy  evidently filched from the cellars of the palace  they looked at us with astonishment as we marched past  through room after room  until at last we came out into a series of great state salons  fronting their long and dirty windows on the square  the walls were covered with huge canvases in massive gilt frames historical battle scenes      12 october 1812  and  6 november 1812  and  16 28 august 1813       one had a gash across the upper right hand corner   the place was all a huge barrack  and evidently had been for weeks  from the look of the floor and walls  machine guns were mounted on window sills  rifles stacked between the mattresses   as we were looking at the pictures an alcoholic breath assailed me from the region of my left ear  and a voice said in thick but fluent french   i see  by the way you admire the paintings  that you are foreigners   he was a short  puffy man with a baldish head as he removed his cap    americans  enchanted  i am stabs capitan vladimir artzibashev  absolutely at your service   it did not seem to occur to him that there was anything unusual in four strangers  one a woman  wandering through the defences of an army awaiting attack  he began to complain of the state of russia    not only these bolsheviki   he said   but the fine traditions of the russian army are broken down  look around you  these are all students in the officers  training schools  but are they gentlemen  kerensky opened the officers  schools to the ranks  to any soldier who could pass an examination  naturally there are many  many who are contaminated by the revolution       without consequence he changed the subject   i am very anxious to go away from russia  i have made up my mind to join the american army  will you please go to your consul and make arrangements  i will give you my address   in spite of our protestations he wrote it on a piece of paper  and seemed to feel better at once  i have it still   oranien baumskaya shkola praporshtchikov 2nd  staraya peterhof      we had a review this morning early   he went on  as he guided us through the rooms and explained everything   the women s battalion decided to remain loyal to the government     are the women soldiers in the palace     yes  they are in the back rooms  where they won t be hurt if any trouble comes   he sighed   it is a great responsibility   said he   for a while we stood at the window  looking down on the square before the palace  where three companies of long coated  yunkers  were drawn up under arms  being harangued by a tall  energetic looking officer i recognised as stankievitch  chief military commissar of the provisional government  after a few minutes two of the companies shouldered arms with a clash  barked three sharp shouts  and went swinging off across the square  disappearing through the red arch into the quiet city    they are going to capture the telephone exchange   said some one  three cadets stood by us  and we fell into conversation  they said they had entered the schools from the ranks  and gave their names robert olev  alexei vasilienko and erni sachs  an esthonian  but now they didn t want to be officers any more  because officers were very unpopular  they didn t seem to know what to do  as a matter of fact  and it was plain that they were not happy   but soon they began to boast   if the bolsheviki come we shall show them how to fight  they do not dare to fight  they are cowards  but if we should be overpowered  well  every man keeps one bullet for himself       at this point there was a burst of rifle fire not far off  out on the square all the people began to run  falling flat on their faces  and the  izvoshtchiki   standing on the corners  galloped in every direction  inside all was uproar  soldiers running here and there  grabbing up guns  rifle belts and shouting   here they come  here they come       but in a few minutes it quieted down again  the  izvoshtchiki  came back  the people lying down stood up  through the red arch appeared the  yunkers   marching a little out of step  one of them supported by two comrades   it was getting late when we left the palace  the sentries in the square had all disappeared  the great semi circle of government buildings seemed deserted  we went into the hotel france for dinner  and right in the middle of soup the waiter  very pale in the face  came up and insisted that we move to the main dining room at the back of the house  because they were going to put out the lights in the caf    there will be much shooting   he said   when we came out on the morskaya again it was quite dark  except for one flickering street light on the corner of the nevsky  under this stood a big armored automobile  with racing engine and oil smoke pouring out of it  a small boy had climbed up the side of the thing and was looking down the barrel of a machine gun  soldiers and sailors stood around  evidently waiting for something  we walked back up to the red arch  where a knot of soldiers was gathered staring at the brightly lighted winter palace and talking in loud tones    no  comrades   one was saying   how can we shoot at them  the women s battalion is in there they will say we have fired on russian women    as we reached the nevsky again another armoured car came around the corner  and a man poked his head out of the turret top    come on   he yelled   let s go on through and attack    the driver of the other car came over  and shouted so as to be heard above the roaring engine   the committee says to wait  they have got artillery behind the wood piles in there       here the street cars had stopped running  few people passed  and there were no lights  but a few blocks away we could see the trams  the crowds  the lighted shop windows and the electric signs of the moving picture shows life going on as usual  we had tickets to the ballet at the marinsky theatre all theatres were open but it was too exciting out of doors      in the darkness we stumbled over lumber piles barricading the police bridge  and before the stroganov palace made out some soldiers wheeling into position a three inch field gun  men in various uniforms were coming and going in an aimless way  and doing a great deal of talking      up the nevsky the whole city seemed to be out promenading  on every corner immense crowds were massed around a core of hot discussion  pickets of a dozen soldiers with fixed bayonets lounged at the street crossings  red faced old men in rich fur coats shook their fists at them  smartly dressed women screamed epithets  the soldiers argued feebly  with embarrassed grins     armoured cars went up and down the street  named after the first tsars oleg  rurik  svietoslav and daubed with huge red letters   r  s  d  r  p     rossiskaya partia        at the mikhailovsky a man appeared with an     russian social democratic labor party    armful of newspapers  and was immediately stormed by frantic people  offering a rouble  five roubles  ten roubles  tearing at each other like animals  it was  rabotchi i soldat   announcing the victory of the proletarian revolution  the liberation of the bolsheviki still in prison  calling upon the army front and rear for support    a feverish little sheet of four pages  running to enormous type  containing no news      on the corner of the sadovaya about two thousand citizens had gathered  staring up at the roof of a tall building  where a tiny red spark glowed and waned    see   said a tall peasant  pointing to it   it is a provocator  presently he will fire on the people      apparently no one thought of going to investigate   the massive facade of smolny blazed with lights as we drove up  and from every street converged upon it streams of hurrying shapes dim in the gloom  automobiles and motorcycles came and went  an enormous elephant coloured armoured automobile  with two red flags flying from the turret  lumbered out with screaming siren  it was cold  and at the outer gate the red guards had built themselves a bon fire  at the inner gate  too  there was a blaze  by the light of which the sentries slowly spelled out our passes and looked us up and down  the canvas covers had been taken off the four rapid fire guns on each side of the doorway  and the ammunition belts hung snakelike from their breeches  a dun herd of armoured cars stood under the trees in the court yard  engines going  the long  bare  dimly illuminated halls roared with the thunder of feet  calling  shouting     there was an atmosphere of recklessness  a crowd came pouring down the staircase  workers in black blouses and round black fur hats  many of them with guns slung over their shoulders  soldiers in rough dirt coloured coats and grey fur  shapki  pinched flat  a leader or so lunatcharsky  kameniev hurrying along in the centre of a group all talking at once  with harassed anxious faces  and bulging portfolios under their arms  the extraordinary meeting of the petrograd soviet was over  i stopped kameniev a quick moving little man  with a wide  vivacious face set close to his shoulders  without preface he read in rapid french a copy of the resolution just passed   the petrograd soviet of workers  and soldiers  deputies  saluting the victorious revolution of the petrograd proletariat and garrison  particularly emphasises the unity  organisation  discipline  and complete cooperation shown by the masses in this rising  rarely has less blood been spilled  and rarely has an insurrection succeeded so well   the soviet expresses its firm conviction that the workers  and peasants  government which  as the government of the soviets  will be created by the revolution  and which will assure the industrial proletariat of the support of the entire mass of poor peasants  will march firmly toward socialism  the only means by which the country can be spared the miseries and unheard of horrors of war   the new workers  and peasants  government will propose immediately a just and democratic peace to all the belligerent countries   it will suppress immediately the great landed property  and transfer the land to the peasants  it will establish workmen s control over production and distribution of manufactured products  and will set up a general control over the banks  which it will transform into a state monopoly   the petrograd soviet of workers  and soldiers  deputies calls upon the workers and the peasants of russia to support with all their energy and all their devotion the proletarian revolution  the soviet expresses its conviction that the city workers  allies of the poor peasants  will assure complete revolutionary order  indispensable to the victory of socialism  the soviet is convinced that the proletariat of the countries of western europe will aid us in conducting the cause of socialism to a real and lasting victory    you consider it won then    he lifted his shoulders   there is much to do  horribly much  it is just beginning      on the landing i met riazanov  vice president of the trade unions  looking black and biting his grey beard   it s insane  insane   he shouted   the european working class won t move  all russia   he waved his hand distractedly and ran off  riazanov and kameniev had both opposed the insurrection  and felt the lash of lenin s terrible tongue      it had been a momentous session  in the name of the military revolutionary committee trotzky had declared that the provisional government no longer existed    the characteristic of bourgeois governments   he said   is to deceive the people  we  the soviets of workers   soldiers  and peasants  deputies  are going to try an experiment unique in history  we are going to found a power which will have no other aim but to satisfy the needs of the soldiers  workers  and peasants    lenin had appeared  welcomed with a mighty ovation  prophesying world wide social revolution     and zinoviev  crying   this day we have paid our debt to the international proletariat  and struck a terrible blow at the war  a terrible body blow at all the imperialists and particularly at wilhelm the executioner      then trotzky  that telegrams had been sent to the front announcing the victorious insurrection  but no reply had come  troops were said to be marching against petrograd a delegation must be sent to tell them the truth   cries   you are anticipating the will of the all russian congress of soviets    trotzky  coldly   the will of the all russian congress of soviets has been anticipated by the rising of the petrograd workers and soldiers    so we came into the great meeting hall  pushing through the clamorous mob at the door  in the rows of seats  under the white chandeliers  packed immovably in the aisles and on the sides  perched on every window sill  and even the edge of the platform  the representatives of the workers and soldiers of all russia waited in anxious silence or wild exultation the ringing of the chairman s bell  there was no heat in the hall but the stifling heat of unwashed human bodies  a foul blue cloud of cigarette smoke rose from the mass and hung in the thick air  occasionally some one in authority mounted the tribune and asked the comrades not to smoke  then everybody  smokers and all  took up the cry  don t smoke  comrades   and went on smoking  petrovsky  anarchist delegate from the obukhov factory  made a seat for me beside him  unshaven and filthy  he was reeling from three nights  sleepless work on the military revolutionary committee   on the platform sat the leaders of the old  tsay ee kah  for the last time dominating the turbulent soviets  which they had ruled from the first days  and which were now risen against them  it was the end of the first period of the russian revolution  which these men had attempted to guide in careful ways     the three greatest of them were not there  kerensky  flying to the front through country towns all doubtfully heaving up  tcheidze  the old eagle  who had contemptuously retired to his own georgian mountains  there to sicken with consumption  and the high souled tseretelli  also mortally stricken  who  nevertheless  would return and pour out his beautiful eloquence for a lost cause  gotz sat there  dan  lieber  bogdanov  broido  fillipovsky  white faced  hollow eyed and indignant  below them the second  siezd  of the all russian soviets boiled and swirled  and over their heads the military revolutionary committee functioned white hot  holding in its hands the threads of insurrection and striking with a long arm     it was 10 40 p  m   dan  a mild faced  baldish figure in a shapeless military surgeon s uniform  was ringing the bell  silence fell sharply  intense  broken by the scuffling and disputing of the people at the door       we have the power in our hands   he began sadly  stopped for a moment  and then went on in a low voice   comrades  the congress of soviets in meeting in such unusual circumstances and in such an extraordinary moment that you will understand why the  tsay ee kah  considers it unnecessary to address you with a political speech  this will become much clearer to you if you will recollect that i am a member of the  tsay ee kah   and that at this very moment our party comrades are in the winter palace under bombardment  sacrificing themselves to execute the duty put on them by the  tsay ee kah     confused uproar     i declare the first session of the second congress of soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies open    the election of the presidium took place amid stir and moving about  avanessov announced that by agreement of the bolsheviki  left socialist revolutionaries and mensheviki internationalists  it was decided to base the presidium upon proportionality  several mensheviki leaped to their feet protesting  a bearded soldier shouted at them   remember what you did to us bolsheviki when  we  were the minority   result 14 bolsheviki  7 socialist revolutionaries  3 mensheviki and 1 internationalist  gorky s group   hendelmann  for the right and centre socialist revolutionaries  said that they refused to take part in the presidium  the same from kintchuk  for the mensheviki  and from the mensheviki internationalists  that until the verification of certain circumstances  they too could not enter the presidium  scattering applause and hoots  one voice   renegades  you call yourselves socialists   a representative of the ukrainean delegates demanded  and received  a place  then the old  tsay ee kah  stepped down  and in their places appeared trotzky  kameniev  lunatcharsky  madame kollentai  nogin     the hall rose  thundering  how far they had soared  these bolsheviki  from a despised and hunted sect less than four months ago  to this supreme place  the helm of great russia in full tide of insurrection   the order of the day  said kameniev  was first  organisation of power  second  war and peace  and third  the constituent assembly  lozovsky  rising  announced that upon agreement of the bureau of all factions  it was proposed to hear and discuss the report of the petrograd soviet  then to give the floor to members of the  tsay ee kah  and the different parties  and finally to pass to the order of the day   but suddenly a new sound made itself heard  deeper than the tumult of the crowd  persistent  disquieting  the dull shock of guns  people looked anxiously toward the clouded windows  and a sort of fever came over them  martov  demanding the floor  croaked hoarsely   the civil war is beginning  comrades  the first question must be a peaceful settlement of the crisis  on principle and from a political standpoint we must urgently discuss a means of averting civil war  our brothers are being shot down in the streets  at this moment  when before the opening of the congress of soviets the question of power is being settled by means of a military plot organised by one of the revolutionary parties   for a moment he could not make himself heard above the noise   all of the revolutionary parties must face the fact  the first  vopros   question  before the congress is the question of power  and this question is already being settled by force of arms in the streets     we must create a power which will be recognised by the whole democracy  if the congress wishes to be the voice of the revolutionary democracy it must not sit with folded hands before the developing civil war  the result of which may be a dangerous outburst of counter revolution     the possibility of a peaceful outcome lies in the formation of a united democratic authority     we must elect a delegation to negotiate with the other socialist parties and organisation      always the methodical muffled boom of cannon through the windows  and the delegates  screaming at each other     so  with the crash of artillery  in the dark  with hatred  and fear  and reckless daring  new russia was being born   the left socialist revolutionaries and the united social democrats supported martov s proposition  it was accepted  a soldier announced that the all russian peasants  soviets had refused to send delegates to the congress  he proposed that a committee be sent with a formal invitation   some delegates are present   he said   i move that they be given votes   accepted   kharash  wearing the epaulets of a captain  passionately demanded the floor   the political hypocrites who control this congress   he shouted   told us we were to settle the question of power and it is being settled behind our backs  before the congress opens  blows are being struck against the winter palace  and it is by such blows that the nails are being driven into the coffin of the political party which has risked such an adventure   uproar  followed him gharra   while we are here discussing propositions of peace  there is a battle on in the streets     the socialist revolutionaries and the mensheviki refuse to be involved in what is happening  and call upon all public forces to resist the attempt to capture the power      kutchin  delegate of the 12th army and representative of the troudoviki   i was sent here only for information  and i am returning at once to the front  where all the army committees consider that the taking of power by the soviets  only three weeks before the constituent assembly  is a stab in the back of the army and a crime against the people    shouts of  lie  you lie      when he could be heard again   let s make an end of this adventure in petrograd  i call upon all delegates to leave this hall in order to save the country and the revolution   as he went down the aisle in the midst of a deafening noise  people surged in upon him  threatening     then khintchuk  an officer with a long brown goatee  speaking suavely and persuasively   i speak for the delegates from the front  the army is imperfectly represented in this congress  and furthermore  the army does not consider the congress of soviets necessary at this time  only three weeks before the opening of the constituent   shouts and stamping  always growing more violent   the army does not consider that the congress of soviets has the necessary authority   soldiers began to stand up all over the hall    who are you speaking for  what do you represent   they cried    the central executive committee of the soviet of the fifth army  the second f  regiment  the first n  regiment  the third s  rifles        when were you elected  you represent the officers  not the soldiers  what do the soldiers say about it   jeers and hoots    we  the front group  disclaim all responsibility for what has happened and is happening  and we consider it necessary to mobilise all self conscious revolutionary forces for the salvation of the revolution  the front group will leave the congress     the place to fight is out on the streets    immense bawling outcry   you speak for the staff not for the army     i appeal to all reasonable soldiers to leave this congress     kornilovitz  counter revolutionist  provocator   were hurled at him   on behalf of the mensheviki  khintchuk then announced that the only possibility of a peaceful solution was to begin negotiations with the provisional government for the formation of a new cabinet  which would find support in all strata of society  he could not proceed for several minutes  raising his voice to a shout he read the menshevik declaration    because the bolsheviki have made a military conspiracy with the aid of the petrograd soviet  without consulting the other factions and parties  we find it impossible to remain in the congress  and therefore withdraw  inviting the other groups to follow us and to meet for discussion of the situation     deserter   at intervals in the almost continuous disturbance hendelman  for the socialist revolutionaries  could be heard protesting against the bombardment of the winter palace      we are opposed to this kind of anarchy       scarcely had he stepped down than a young  lean faced soldier  with flashing eyes  leaped to the platform  and dramatically lifted his hand    comrades   he cried and there was a hush   my  familia   name  is peterson i speak for the second lettish rifles  you have heard the statements of two representatives of the army committees  these statements would have some value  if their authors had been representatives of the army    wild applause    but they do not represent the soldiers    shaking his fist   the twelfth army has been insisting for a long time upon the re election of the great soviet and the army committee  but just as your own  tsay ee kah   our committee refused to call a meeting of the representatives of the masses until the end of september  so that the reactionaries could elect their own false delegates to this congress  i tell you now  the lettish soldiers have many times said   no more resolutions  no more talk  we want deeds the power must be in our hands   let these impostor delegates leave the congress  the army is not with them    the hall rocked with cheering  in the first moments of the session  stunned by the rapidity of events  startled by the sound of cannon  the delegates had hesitated  for an hour hammer blow after hammer blow had fallen from that tribune  welding them together but beating them down  did they stand then alone  was russia rising against them  was it true that the army was marching on petrograd  then this clear eyed young soldier had spoken  and in a flash they knew it for the truth      this  was the voice of the soldiers the stirring millions of uniformed workers and peasants were men like them  and their thoughts and feelings were the same     more soldiers     gzhelshakh  for the front delegates  announcing that they had only decided to leave the congress by a small majority  and that  the bolshevik members had not even taken part in the vote   as they stood for division according to political parties  and not groups   hundreds of delegates from the front   he said   are being elected without the participation of the soldiers because the army committees are no longer the real representatives of the rank and file      lukianov  crying that officers like kharash and khintchuk could not represent the army in this congress  but only the high command   the real inhabitants of the trenches want with all their hearts the transfer of power into the hands of the soviets  and they expect very much from it      the tide was turning   then came abramovitch  for the  bund   the organ of the jewish social democrats his eyes snapping behind thick glasses  trembling with rage    what is taking place now in petrograd is a monstrous calamity  the  bund  group joins with the declaration of the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries and will leave the congress   he raised his voice and hand   our duty to the russian proletariat doesn t permit us to remain here and be responsible for these crimes  because the firing on the winter palace doesn t cease  the municipal duma together with the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries  and the executive committee of the peasants  soviet  has decided to perish with the provisional government  and we are going with them  unarmed we will expose our breasts to the machine guns of the terrorists     we invite all delegates to this congress   the rest was lost in a storm of hoots  menaces and curses which rose to a hellish pitch as fifty delegates got up and pushed their way out      kameniev jangled the bell  shouting   keep your seats and we ll go on with our business   and trotzky  standing up with a pale  cruel face  letting out his rich voice in cool contempt   all these so called socialist compromisers  these frightened mensheviki  socialist revolutionaries   bund  let them go  they are just so much refuse which will be swept into the garbage heap of history    riazanov  for the bolsheviki  stated that at the request of the city duma the military revolutionary committee had sent a delegation to offer negotiations to the winter palace   in this way we have done everything possible to avoid blood shed       we hurried from the place  stopping for a moment at the room where the military revolutionary committee worked at furious speed  engulfing and spitting out panting couriers  despatching commissars armed with power of life and death to all the corners of the city  amid the buzz of the telephonographs  the door opened  a blast of stale air and cigarette smoke rushed out  we caught a glimpse of dishevelled men bending over a map under the glare of a shaded electric light     comrade josephov dukhvinski  a smiling youth with a mop of pale yellow hair  made out passes for us   when we came into the chill night  all the front of smolny was one huge park of arriving and departing automobiles  above the sound of which could be heard the far off slow beat of the cannon  a great motor truck stood there  shaking to the roar of its engine  men were tossing bundles into it  and others receiving them  with guns beside them    where are you going   i shouted    down town all over everywhere   answered a little workman  grinning  with a large exultant gesture   we showed our passes   come along   they invited   but there ll probably be shooting   we climbed in  the clutch slid home with a raking jar  the great car jerked forward  we all toppled backward on top of those who were climbing in  past the huge fire by the gate  and then the fire by the outer gate  glowing red on the faces of the workmen with rifles who squatted around it  and went bumping at top speed down the suvorovsky prospect  swaying from side to side     one man tore the wrapping from a bundle and began to hurl handfuls of     l handfuls of                  papers into the air  we imitated him  plunging down through the dark street with a tail of white papers floating and eddying out behind  the late passerby stooped to pick them up  the patrols around bonfires on the corners ran out with uplifted arms to catch them  sometimes armed men loomed up ahead  crying   shtoi    and raising their guns  but our chauffeur only yelled something unintelligible and we hurtled on      i picked up a copy of the paper  and under a fleeting street light read   to the citizens of russia   the provisional government is deposed  the state power has passed into the hands of the organ of the petrograd soviet of workers  and soldiers  deputies  the military revolutionary committee  which stands at the head of the petrograd proletariat and garrison   the cause for which the people were fighting  immediate proposal of a democratic peace  abolition of landlord property rights over the land  labor control over production  creation of a soviet government that cause is securely achieved   long live the revolution of workmen  soldiers and peasants    military revolutionary

the fall of the provisional government issued by the military revolutionary committee on the night of november 7th  our calendar   which we helped to distribute from a motor truck just after the surrender of the winter palace   a slant eyed  mongolian faced man who sat beside me  dressed in a goat skin caucasian cape  snapped   look out  here the provocators always shoot from the windows   we turned into znamensky square  dark and almost deserted  careened around trubetskoy s brutal statue and swung down the wide nevsky  three men standing up with rifles ready  peering at the windows  behind us the street was alive with people running and stooping  we could no longer hear the cannon  and the nearer we drew to the winter palace end of the city the quieter and more deserted were the streets  the city duma was all brightly lighted  beyond that we made out a dark mass of people  and a line of sailors  who yelled furiously at us to stop  the machine slowed down  and we climbed out   it was an astonishing scene  just at the corner of the ekaterina canal  under an arc light  a cordon of armed sailors was drawn across the nevsky  blocking the way to a crowd of people in column of fours  there were about three or four hundred of them  men in frock coats  well dressed women  officers all sorts and conditions of people  among them we recognised many of the delegates from the congress  leaders of the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries  avksentiev  the lean  red bearded president of the peasants  soviets  sarokin  kerensky s spokesman  khintchuk  abramovitch  and at the head white bearded old schreider  mayor of petrograd  and prokopovitch  minister of supplies in the provisional government  arrested that morning and released  i caught sight of malkin  reporter for the  russian daily news    going to die in the winter palace   he shouted cheerfully  the procession stood still  but from the front of it came loud argument  schreider and prokopovitch were bellowing at the big sailor who seemed in command    we demand to pass   they cried   see  these comrades come from the congress of soviets  look at their tickets  we are going to the winter palace    the sailor was plainly puzzled  he scratched his head with an enormous hand  frowning   i have orders from the committee not to let anybody go to the winter palace   he grumbled   but i will send a comrade to telephone to smolny        we insist upon passing  we are unarmed  we will march on whether you permit us or not   cried old schreider  very much excited    i have orders   repeated the sailor sullenly    shoot us if you want to  we will pass  forward   came from all sides   we are ready to die  if you have the heart to fire on russians and comrades  we bare our breasts to your guns     no   said the sailor  looking stubborn   i can t allow you to pass     what will you do if we go forward  will you shoot     no  i m not going to shoot people who haven t any guns  we won t shoot unarmed russian people        we will go forward  what can you do     we will do something  replied the sailor  evidently at a loss   we can t let you pass  we will do something     what will you do  what will you do    another sailor came up  very much irritated   we will spank you   he cried  energetically   and if necessary we will shoot you too  go home now  and leave us in peace    at this there was a great clamour of anger and resentment  prokopovitch had mounted some sort of box  and  waving his umbrella  he made a speech    comrades and citizens   he said   force is being used against us  we cannot have our innocent blood upon the hands of these ignorant men  it is beneath our dignity to be shot down here in the street by switchmen    what he meant by  switchmen  i never discovered    let us return to the duma and discuss the best means of saving the country and the revolution    whereupon  in dignified silence  the procession marched around and back up the nevsky  always in column of fours  and taking advantage of the diversion we slipped past the guards and set off in the direction of the winter palace   here it was absolutely dark  and nothing moved but pickets of soldiers and red guards grimly intent  in front of the kazan cathedral a three inch field gun lay in the middle of the street  slewed sideways from the recoil of its last shot over the roofs  soldiers were standing in every doorway talking in low tones and peering down toward the police bridge  i heard one voice saying   it is possible that we have done wrong      at the corners patrols stopped all passersby and the composition of these patrols was interesting  for in command of the regular troops was invariably a red guard     the shooting had ceased   just as we came to the morskaya somebody was shouting   the  yunkers  have sent word they want us to go and get them out   voices began to give commands  and in the thick gloom we made out a dark mass moving forward  silent but for the shuffle of feet and the clinking of arms  we fell in with the first ranks   like a black river  filling all the street  without song or cheer we poured through the red arch  where the man just ahead of me said in a low voice   look out  comrades  don t trust them  they will fire  surely   in the open we began to run  stooping low and bunching together  and jammed up suddenly behind the pedestal of the alexander column    how many of you did they kill   i asked    i don t know  about ten       after a few minutes huddling there  some hundreds of men  the army seemed reassured and without any orders suddenly began again to flow forward  by this time  in the light that streamed out of all the winter palace windows  i could see that the first two or three hundred men were red guards  with only a few scattered soldiers  over the barricade of firewood we clambered  and leaping down inside gave a triumphant shout as we stumbled on a heap of rifles thrown down by the  yunkers  who had stood there  on both sides of the main gateway the doors stood wide open  light streamed out  and from the huge pile came not the slightest sound   carried along by the eager wave of men we were swept into the right hand entrance  opening into a great bare vaulted room  the cellar of the east wing  from which issued a maze of corridors and stair cases  a number of huge packing cases stood about  and upon these the red guards and soldiers fell furiously  battering them open with the butts of their rifles  and pulling out carpets  curtains  linen  porcelain plates  glassware     one man went strutting around with a bronze clock perched on his shoulder  another found a plume of ostrich feathers  which he stuck in his hat  the looting was just beginning when somebody cried   comrades  don t touch anything  don t take anything  this is the property of the people   immediately twenty voices were crying   stop  put everything back  don t take anything  property of the people   many hands dragged the spoilers down  damask and tapestry were snatched from the arms of those who had them  two men took away the bronze clock  roughly and hastily the things were crammed back in their cases  and self appointed sentinels stood guard  it was all utterly spontaneous  through corridors and up stair cases the cry could be heard growing fainter and fainter in the distance   revolutionary discipline  property of the people       we crossed back over to the left entrance  in the west wing  there order was also being established   clear the palace   bawled a red guard  sticking his head through an inner door   come  comrades  let s show that we re not thieves and bandits  everybody out of the palace except the commissars  until we get sentries posted    two red guards  a soldier and an officer  stood with revolvers in their hands  another soldier sat at a table behind them  with pen and paper  shouts of  all out  all out   were heard far and near within  and the army began to pour  through the door  jostling  expostulating  arguing  as each man appeared he was seized by the self appointed committee  who went through his pockets and looked under his coat  everything that was plainly not his property was taken away  the man at the table noted it on his paper  and it was carried into a little room  the most amazing assortment of objects were thus confiscated  statuettes  bottles of ink  bed spreads worked with the imperial monogram  candles  a small oil painting  desk blotters  gold handled swords  cakes of soap  clothes of every description  blankets  one red guard carried three rifles  two of which he had taken away from  yunkers   another had four portfolios bulging with written documents  the culprits either sullenly surrendered or pleaded like children  all talking at once the committee explained that stealing was not worthy of the people s champions  often those who had been caught turned around and began to help go through the rest of the comrades   see app  iv  sect  3    yunkers  came out  in bunches of three or four  the committee seized upon them with an excess of zeal  accompanying the search with remarks like   ah  provocators  kornilovists  counter revolutionists  murderers of the people   but there was no violence done  although the  yunkers  were terrified  they too had their pockets full of small plunder  it was carefully noted down by the scribe  and piled in the little room     the  yunkers  were disarmed   now  will you take up arms against the people any more   demanded clamouring voices    no   answered the  yunkers   one by one  whereupon they were allowed to go free   we asked if we might go inside  the committee was doubtful  but the big red guard answered firmly that it was forbidden   who are you anyway   he asked   how do i know that you are not all kerenskys   there were five of us  two women      pazhal st   touarishtchi   way  comrades   a soldier and a red guard appeared in the door  waving the crowd aside  and other guards with fixed bayonets  after them followed single file half a dozen men in civilian dress the members of the provisional government  first came kishkin  his face drawn and pale  then rutenberg  looking sullenly at the floor  terestchenko was next  glancing sharply around  he stared at us with cold fixity     they passed in silence  the victorious insurrectionists crowded to see  but there were only a few angry mutterings  it was only later that we learned how the people in the street wanted to lynch them  and shots were fired but the sailors brought them safely to peter paul      in the meanwhile unrebuked we walked into the palace  there was still a great deal of coming and going  of exploring new found apartments in the vast edifice  of searching for hidden garrisons of  yunkers  which did not exist  we went upstairs and wandered through room after room  this part of the palace had been entered also by other detachments from the side of the neva  the paintings  statues  tapestries and rugs of the great state apartments were unharmed  in the offices  however  every desk and cabinet had been ransacked  the papers scattered over the floor  and in the living rooms beds had been stripped of their coverings and ward robes wrenched open  the most highly prized loot was clothing  which the working people needed  in a room where furniture was stored we came upon two soldiers ripping the elaborate spanish leather upholstery from chairs  they explained it was to make boots with      the old palace servants in their blue and red and gold uniforms stood nervously about  from force of habit repeating   you can t go in there   barin   it is forbidden   we penetrated at length to the gold and malachite chamber with crimson brocade hangings where the ministers had been in session all that day and night  and where the  shveitzari  had betrayed them to the red guards  the long table covered with green baize was just as they had left it  under arrest  before each empty seat was pen and ink and paper  the papers were scribbled over with beginnings of plans of action  rough drafts of proclamations and manifestos  most of these were scratched out  as their futility became evident  and the rest of the sheet covered with absent minded geometrical designs  as the writers sat despondently listening while minister after minister proposed chimerical schemes  i took one of these scribbled pages  in the hand writing of konovalov  which read   the provisional government appeals to all classes to support the provisional government    all this time  it must be remembered  although the winter palace was surrounded  the government was in constant communication with the front and with provincial russia  the bolsheviki had captured the ministry of war early in the morning  but they did not know of the military telegraph office in the attic  nor of the private telephone line connecting it with the winter palace  in that attic a young officer sat all day  pouring out over the country a flood of appeals and proclamations  and when he heard that the palace had fallen  put on his hat and walked calmly out of the building      interested as we were  for a considerable time we didn t notice a change in the attitude of the soldiers and red guards around us  as we strolled from room to room a small group followed us  until by the time we reached the great picture gallery where we had spent the afternoon with the  yunkers   about a hundred men surged in after us  one giant of a soldier stood in our path  his face dark with sullen suspicion    graphic page 104  doodling by konavalov  title follows   facsimile of the beginning of a proclamation  written in pencil by a i  konovalov  minister of commerce and industry in he provisional government  and then scratched out as the hopelessness of the situation became more and more evident  the geometrical figure beneath was probably idly drawn while the ministers were waiting for the end    who are you   he growled   what are you doing here   the others massed slowly around  staring and beginning to mutter    provocatori    i heard somebody say   looters   i produced our passes from the military revolutionary committee  the soldier took them gingerly  turned them upside down and looked at them without comprehension  evidently he could not read  he handed them back and spat on the floor    bumagi   papers   said he with contempt  the mass slowly began to close in  like wild cattle around a cowpuncher on foot  over their heads i caught sight of an officer  looking helpless  and shouted to him  he made for us  shouldering his way through    i m the commissar   he said to me   who are you  what is it   the others held back  waiting  i produced the papers    you are foreigners   he rapidly asked in franch   it is very dangerous      then he turned to the mob  holding up our documents   comrades   he cried   these people are foreign comrades from america  they have come here to be able to tell their countrymen about the bravery and the revolutionary discipline of the proletarian army     how do you know that   replied the big soldier   i tell you they are provocators  they say they came here to observe the revolutionary discipline of the proletarian army  but they have been wandering freely through the palace  and how do we know they haven t got their pockets full of loot      pravilno    snarled the others  pressing forward    comrades  comrades   appealed the officer  sweat standing out on his forehead   i am commissar of the military revolutionary committee  do you trust me  well  i tell you that these passes are signed with the same names that are signed to my pass    he led us down through the palace and out through a door opening onto the neva quay  before which stood the usual committee going through pockets     you have narrowly escaped   he kept muttering  wiping his face    what happened to the women s battalion   we asked    oh the women   he laughed   they were all huddled up in a back room  we had a terrible time deciding what to do with them many were in hysterics  and so on  so finally we marched them up to the finland station and put them on a train for levashovo  where they have a camp   see app  iv  sect  4       we came out into the cold  nervous night  murmurous with obscure armies on the move  electric with patrols  from across the river  where loomed the darker mass of peter paul  came a hoarse shout     underfoot the sidewalk was littered with broken stucco  from the cornice of the palace where two shells from the battleship  avrora  had struck  that was the only damage done by the bombardment      it was now after three in the morning  on the nevsky all the street lights were again shining  the cannon gone  and the only signs of war were red guards and soldiers squatting around fires  the city was quiet probably never so quiet in its history  on that night not a single hold up occurred  not a single robbery   but the city duma building was all illuminated  we mounted to the galleried alexander hall  hung with its great  gold framed  red shrouded imperial portraits  about a hundred people were grouped around the platform  where skobeliev was speaking  he urged that the committee of public safety be expanded  so as to unite all the anti bolshevik elements in one huge organisation  to be called the committee for salvation of country and revolution  and as we looked on  the committee for salvation was formed that committee which was to develop into the most powerful enemy of the bolsheviki  appearing  in the next week  sometimes under its own partisan name  and sometimes as the strictly non partisan committee of public safety      dan  gotz  avkesntiev were there  some of the insurgent soviet delegates  members of the executive committee of the peasants  soviets  old prokopovitch  and even members of the  council of the republic among whom vinaver and other cadets  lieber cried that the convention of soviets was not a legal convention  that the old  tsay ee kah  was still in office     an appeal to the country was drafted   we hailed a cab   where to   but when we said  smolny   the  izvoshtchik  shook his head    niet    said he   there are devils      it was only after weary wandering that we found a driver willing to take us and he wanted thirty rubles  and stopped two blocks away   the windows of smolny were still ablaze  motors came and went  and around the still leaping fires the sentries huddled close  eagerly asking everybody the latest news  the corridors were full of hurrying men  hollow eyed and dirty  in some of the committee rooms people lay sleeping on the floor  their guns beside them  in spite of the seceding delegates  the hall of meetings was crowded with people  roaring like the sea  as we came in  kameniev was reading the list of arrested ministers  the name of terestchenko was greeted with thunderous applause  shouts of satisfaction  laughter  rutenburg came in for less  and at the mention of paltchinsky  a storm of hoots  angry cries  cheers burst forth     it was announced that tchudnovsky had been appointed commissar of the winter palace   now occurred a dramatic interruption  a big peasant  his bearded face convulsed with rage  mounted the platform and pounded with his fist on the presidium table    we  socialist revolutionaries  insist upon the immediate release of the socialist ministers arrested in the winter palace  comrades  do you know that four comrades who risked their lives and their freedom fighting against tyranny of the tsar  have been flung into peter paul prison the historical tomb of liberty   in the uproar he pounded and yelled  another delegate climbed up beside him  and pointed at the presidium    are the representatives of the revolutionary masses going to sit quietly here while the  okhrana  of the bolsheviki tortures their leaders    trotzky was gesturing for silence   these  comrades  who are now caught plotting the crushing of the soviets with the adventurer kerensky is there any reason to handle them with gloves  after july 16th and 18th they didn t use much ceremony with us   with a triumphant ring in his voice he cried   now that the  oborontsi  and the faint hearted have gone  and the whole task of defending and saving the revolution rests on our shoulders  it is particularly necessary to work work work  we have decided to die rather than give up    followed him a commissar from tsarskoye selo  panting and covered with the mud of his ride   the garrison of tsarskoye selo is on guard at the gates of petrograd  ready to defend the soviets and the military revolutionary committee   wild cheers   the cycle corps sent from the front has arrived at tsarskoye  and the soldiers are now with us  they recognise the power of the soviets  the necessity of immediate transfer of land to the peasants and industrial control to the workers  the fifth battalion of cyclists  stationed at tsarskoye  is ours      then the delegate of the third cycle battalion  in the midst of delirious enthusiasm he told how the cycle corps had been ordered  three days before  from the south west front to the  defence of petrograd   they suspected  however  the meaning of the order  and at the station of peredolsk were met by representatives of the fifth battalion from tsarskoye  a joint meeting was held  and it was discovered that  among the cyclists not a single man was found willing to shed the blood of his brothers  or to support a government of bourgeois and land owners    kapelinski  for the mensheviki internationalists  proposed to elect a special committee to find a peaceful solution to the civil war   there isn t any peaceful solution   bellowed the crowed   victory is the only solution   the vote was overwhelmingly against  and the mensheviki internationalists left the congress in a whirlwind of jocular insults  there was no longer any panic fear     kameniev from the platform shouted after them   the mensheviki internationalists claimed  emergency  for the question of a  peaceful solution   but they always voted for suspension of the order of the day in favour of declarations of factions which wanted to leave the congress  it is evident   finished kameniev   that the withdrawal of all these renegades was decided upon beforehand    the assembly decided to ignore the withdrawal of the factions  and proceed to the appeal to the workers  soldiers and peasants of all russia   to workers  soldiers and peasants  the second all russian congress of soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies has opened  it represents the great majority of the soviets  there are also a number of peasant deputies  based upon the will of the great majority of the workers   soldiers and peasants  based upon the triumphant uprising of the petrograd workmen and soldiers  the congress assumes the power   the provisional government is deposed  most of the members of the provisional government are already arrested   the soviet authority will at once propose an immediate democratic peace to all nations  and an immediate truce on all fronts  it will assure the free transfer of landlord  crown and monastery lands to the land committees  defend the soldiers rights  enforcing a complete democratisation of the army  establish workers  control over production  ensure the convocation of the constituent assembly at the proper date  take means to supply bread to the cities and articles of first necessity to the villages  and secure to all nationalities living in russia a real right to independent existence   the congress resolves  that all local power shall be transferred to the soviets of workers   soldiers  and peasants  deputies  which must enforce revolutionary order   the congress calls upon the soldiers in the trenches to be watchful and steadfast  the congress of soviets is sure that the revolutionary army will know how to defend the revolution against all attacks of imperialism  until the new government shall have brought about the conclusion of the democratic peace which it will directly propose to all nations  the new government will take all necessary steps to secure everything needful to the revolutionary army  by means of a determined policy

russian congress of soviets of   workers  and soldiers  deputies    delegates from the peasants  soviets    it was exactly 5 17 a m  when krylenko  staggering with fatigue  climbed to the tribune with a telegram in his hand    comrades  from the northern front  the twelfth army sends greetings to the congress of soviets  announcing the formation of a military revolutionary committee which has taken over the command of the northern front   pandemonium  men weeping  embracing each other   general tchermissov has recognised the committee commissar of the provisional government voitinsky has resigned    so  lenin and the petrograd workers had decided on insurrection  the petrograd soviet had overthrown the provisional government  and thrust the  coup d etat  upon the congress of soviets  now there was all great russia to win and then the world  would russia follow and rise  and the world what of it  would the peoples answer and rise  a red world tide   although it was six in the morning  night was yet heavy and chill  there was only a faint unearthly pallor stealing over the silent streets  dimming the watch fires  the shadow of a terrible dawn grey rising over russia                                    chapter v                              plunging ahead  thursday  november 8th  day broke on a city in the wildest excitement and confusion  a whole nation having up in long hissing swells of storm  superficially all was quiet  hundreds of thousands of people retired at a prudent hour  got up early  and went to work  in petrograd the street cars were running  the stores and restaurants open  theatres going  an exhibition of paintings advertised     all the complex routine of common life humdrum even in war time proceeded as usual  nothing is so astounding as the vitality of the social organism how it persists  feeding itself  clothing itself  amusing itself  in the face of the worst calamities      the air was full of rumours about kerensky  who was said to have raised the front  and to be leading a great army against the capital   volia naroda  published a  prikaz  launched by him at pskov   the disorders caused by the insane attempt of the bolsheviki place the country on the verge of a precipice  and demand the effort of our entire will  our courage and the devotion of every one of us  to win through the terrible trial which the fatherland is undergoing      until the declaration of the composition of the new government if one is formed every one ought to remain at his post and fulfil his duty toward bleeding russia  it must be remembered that the least interference with existing army organisations can bring on irreparable misfortunes  by opening the front to the enemy  therefore it is indispensable to preserve at any price the morale of the troops  by assuring complete order and the preservation of the army from new shocks  and by maintaining absolute confidence between officers and their subordinates  i order all the chiefs and commissars  in the name of the safety of the country  to stay at their posts  as i myself retain the post of supreme commander  until the provisional government of the republic shall declare its will      in answer  this placard on all the walls   from the all russian congress of soviets   the ex ministers konovalov  kishkin  terestchenko  maliantovitch  nikitin and others have been arrested by the

side  what a storm of proclamations posted up  hand bills scattered everywhere  newspapers screaming and cursing and prophesying evil  now raged the battle of the printing press all other weapons being in the hands of the soviets   first  the appeal of the committee for salvation of country and revolution  flung broadcast over russia and europe   to the citizens of the russian republic   contrary to the will of the revolutionary masses  on november 7th the bolsheviki of petrograd criminally arrested part of the provisional government  dispersed the council of the republic  and proclaimed an illegal power  such violence committed against the government of revolutionary russia at the moment of its greatest external danger  is an indescribable crime against the fatherland   the insurrection of the bolsheviki deals a mortal blow to the cause of national defence  and postpones immeasurably the moment of peace so greatly desired   civil war  begun by the bolsheviki  threatens to deliver the country to the horrors of anarchy and counter revolution  and cause the failure of the constituent assembly  which must affirm the republican r gime and transmit to the people forever their right to the land   preserving the continuity of the only legal governmental power  the committee for salvation of country and revolution  established on the night of november 7th  takes the initiative in forming a new provisional government  which  basing itself on the forces of democracy  will conduct the country to the constituent assembly and save it from anarchy and counter revolution  the committee for salvation summons you  citizens  to refuse to recognise the power of violence  do not obey its orders   rise for the defence of the country and revolution   support the committee for salvation   signed by the council of the russian republic  the municipal duma of petrograd  the  tsay ee kah  first congress    the executive committee of the peasants  soviets  and from

trample on our liberty  black hundred  pogroms  will spread over russia  if we all conscious workers  soldiers  citizens do not unite      do not trust the promises of the bolsheviki  the promise of immediate peace is a lie  the promise of bread a hoax  the promise of land a fairy tale      they were all in this manner   comrades  you have been basely and cruelly deceived  the seizure of power has been accomplished by the bolsheviki alone     they concealed their plot from the other socialist parties composing the soviet      you have been promised land and freedom  but the counter revolution will profit by the anarchy called forth by the bolsheviki  and will deprive you of land and freedom      the newspapers were as violent   our duty  said the  dielo naroda   is to unmask these traitors to the working class  our duty is to mobilise all our forces and mount guard over the cause of the revolution       izviestia   for the last time speaking in the name of the old  tsay ee kah   threatened awful retribution   as for the congress of soviets  we affirm that there has been no congress of soviets  we affirm that it was merely a private conference of the bolshevik faction  and in that case  they have no right to cancel the powers of the  tsay ee kah        novaya zhizn   while pleading for a new government that should unite all the socialist parties  criticised severely the action of the socialist revolutionaries and the mensheviki in quitting the congress  and pointed out that the bolshevik insurrection meant one thing very clearly  that all illusions about coalition with the bourgeoisie were henceforth demonstrated vain      rabotchi put  blossomed out as  pravda   lenin s newspaper which had been suppressed in july  it crowed  bristling   workers  soldiers  peasants  in march you struck down the tyranny of the clique of nobles  yesterday you struck down the tyranny of the bourgeois gang      the first task now is to guard the approaches to petrograd   the second is definitely to disarm the counter revolutionary elements of petrograd   the third is definitely to organise the revolutionary power and assure the realisation of the popular programme     what few cadet organs appeared  and the bourgeoisie generally  adopted a detached  ironical attitude toward the whole business  a sort of contemptuous  i told you so  to the other parties  influential cadets were to be seen hovering around the municipal duma  and on the outskirts of the committee for salvation  other than that  the bourgeoisie lay low  biding its hour which could not far off  that the bolsheviki would remain in power longer than three days never occurred to anybody except perhaps to lenin  trotzky  the petrograd workers and the simpler soldiers      in the high  amphitheatrical nicolai hall that afternoon i saw the duma sitting in  permanence   tempestuous  grouping around it all the forces of opposition  the old mayer  schreider  majestic with his white hair and beard  was describing his visit to smolny the night before  to protest in the name of the municipal self government   the duma  being the only existing legal government in the city  elected by equal  direct and secret suffrage  would not recognise the new power   he had told trotzky  and trotzky had answered   there is a constitutional remedy for that  the duma can be dissolved and re elected      at this report there was a furious outcry    if one recognises a government by bayonet   continued the old man  addressing the duma   well  we have one  but i consider legitimate only a government recognised by the majority  and not one created by the usurpation of a minority   wild applause on all benches except those of the bolsheviki  amid renewed tumult the mayor announced that the bolsheviki already were violating municipal autonomy by appointing commissars in many departments   the bolshevik speaker shouted  trying to make himself heard  that the decision of the congress of soviets meant that all russia backed up the action of the bolsheviki    you   he cried   you are not the real representative of the people of petrograd   shrieks of  insult  insult   the old mayor  with dignity  reminded him that the duma was elected by the freest possible popular vote   yes   he answered   but that was a long time ago like the  tsay ee kah  like the army committee     there has been no new congress of soviets   they yelled at him    the bolshevik faction refuses to remain any longer in this nest of counter revolution   uproar    and we demand a re election of the duma      whereupon the bolsheviki left the chamber  followed by cries of  german agents  down with the traitors    shingariov  cadet  then demanded that all municipal functionaries who had consented to be commissars of the military revolutionary committee be discharged from their position and indicted  schreider was on his feet  putting a motion to the effect that the duma protested against the menace of the bolsheviki to dissolve it  and as the legal representative of the population  it would refuse to leave its post   outside  the alexander hall was crowded for the meeting of the committee for salvation  and skobeliev was again speaking   never yet   he said   was the fate of the revolution so acute  never yet did the question of the existence of the russian state excite so much anxiety  never yet did history put so harshly and categorically the question is russia to be or not to be  the great hour for the salvation of the revolution has arrived  and in consciousness thereof we observe the close union of the live forces of the revolutionary democracy  by whose organised will a centre for the salvation of the country and the revolution has already been created      and much of the same sort   we shall die sooner than surrender our post    amid violent applause it was announced that the union of railway workers had joined the committee for salvation  a few moments later the post and telegraph employees came in  then some mensheviki internationalists entered the hall  to cheers  the railway men said they did not recognise the bolsheviki and had taken the entire railroad apparatus into their own hands  refusing to entrust it to any usurpatory power  the telegraphers  delegate declared that the operators had flatly refused to work their instruments as long as the bolshevik commissar was in the office  the postmen would not deliver or accept mail at smolny     all the smolny telephones were cut off  with great glee it was reported how uritzky had gone to the ministry of foreign affairs to demand the secret treaties  and how neratov had put him out  the government employees were all stopping work      it was war war deliberately planned  russian fashion  war by strike and sabotage  as we sat there the chairman read a list of names and assignments  so and so was to make the round of the ministries  another was to visit the banks  some ten or twelve were to work the barracks and persuade the soldiers to remain neutral  russian soldiers  do not shed the blood of your brothers    a committee was to go and confer with kerensky  still others were despatched to provincial cities  to form branches of the committee for salvation  and link together the anti bolshevik elements   the crowd was in high spirits   these bolsheviki  will  try to dictate to the  intelligentzia   we ll show them      nothing could be more striking than the contrast between this assemblage and the congress of soviets  there  great masses of shabby soldiers  grimy workmen  peasants poor men  bent and scarred in the brute struggle for existence  here the menshevik and social revolutionary leaders avksentievs  dans  liebers  the former socialist ministers skobelievs  tchernovs  rubbed shoulders with cadets like oily shatsky  sleek vinaver  with journalists  students  intellectuals of almost all camps  this duma crowd was well fed  well dressed  i did not see more than three proletarians among them all      news came  kornilov s faithful  tekhintsi       had slaughtered his    see notes and explanations  guards at bykhov  and he had escaped  kaledin was marching north     the soviet of moscow had set up a military revolutionary committee  and was negotiating with the commandant of the city for possession of the arsenal  so that the workers might be armed   with these facts was mixed an astounding jumble of rumours  distortions  and plain lies  for instance  an intelligent young cadet  formerly private secretary to miliukov and then to terestchenko  drew us aside and told us all about the taking of the winter palace    the bolsheviki were led by german and austrian officers   he affirmed    is that so   we replied  politely   how do you know     a friend of mine was there and saw them     how could he tell they were german officers     oh  because they wore german uniforms    there were hundreds of such absurd tales  and they were not only solemnly published by the anti bolshevik press  but believed by the most unlikely persons socialist revolutionaries and mensheviki who had always been distinguished by their sober devotion to facts      but more serious were the stories of bolshevik violence and terrorism  for example  it was said printed that the red guards had not only thoroughly looted the winter palace  but that they had massacred the  yunkers  after disarming them  had killed some of the ministers in cold blood  and as for the woman soldiers  most of them had been violated  and many had committed suicide because of the tortures they had gone through     all these stories were swallowed whole by the crowd in the duma  and worse still  the mothers and fathers of the students and of the women read these frightful details   often accompanied by lists of names   and toward nightfall the duma began to be besieged by frantic citizens      a typical case is that of prince tumanov  whose body  it was announced in many newspapers  had been found floating in the moika canal  a few hours later this was denied by the prince s family  who added that the prince was under arrest so the press identified the dead man as general demissov  the general having also come to life  we investigated  and could find no trace of any body found whatever      as we left the duma building two boy scouts were distributing hand bills  see app  v  sect  2  to the enormous crowd which blocked the nevsky in front of the door a crowd composed almost entirely of business men  shop keepers   tchinouniki   clerks  one read   from the municipal duma  the municipal duma in its meeting of october 26th  in view of the events of the day decrees  to announce the inviolability of private dwellings  through the house committees it calls upon the population of the town of petrograd to meet with decisive repulse all attempts to enter by force private apartments  not stopping at the use of arms  in the interests of the self defence of citizens   up on the corner of the liteiny  five or six red guards and a couple of sailors had surrounded a news dealer and were demanding that he hand over his copies of the menshevik  rabot chaya gazeta   workers  gazette   angrily he shouted at them  shaking his fist  as one of the sailors tore the papers from his stand  an ugly crowd had gathered around  abusing the patrol  one little workman kept explaining doggedly to the people and the news dealer  over and over again   it has kerensky s proclamation in it  it says we killed russian people  it will make bloodshed       smolny was tenser than ever  if that were possible  the same running men in the dark corridors  squads of workers with rifles  leaders with bulging portfolios arguing  explaining  giving orders as they hurried anxiously along  surrounded by friends and lieutenants  men literally out of themselves  living prodigies of sleeplessness and work men unshaven  filthy  with burning eyes  who drove upon their fixed purpose full speed on engines of exaltation  so much they had to do  so much  take over the government  organise the city  keep the garrison loyal  fight the duma and the committee for salvation  keep out the germans  prepare to do battle with kerensky  inform the provinces what had happened  propagandise from archangel to vladivostok     government and municipal employees refusing to obey their commissars  post and telegraph refusing them communication  railroads roads stonily ignoring their appeals for trains  kerensky coming  the garrison not altogether to be trusted  the cossacks waiting to come out     against them not only the organised bourgeoisie  but all the other socialist parties except the left socialist revolutionaries  a few mensheviki internationalists and the social democrat internationalists  and even they undecided whether to stand by or not  with them  it is true  the workers and the soldier masses the peasants an unknown quantity but after all the bolsheviki were a political faction not rich in trained and educated men      riazanov was coming up the front steps  explaining in a sort of humorous panic that he  commissar of commerce  knew nothing whatever of business  in the upstairs cafe sat a man all by himself in the corner  in a goat skin cape and clothes which had been i was going to say  slept in   but of course he hadn t slept and a three days  growth of beard  he was anxiously figuring on a dirty envelope  and biting his pencil meanwhile  this was menzhinsky  commissar of finance  whose qualifications were that he had once been clerk in a french bank     and these four half running down the hall from the office of the military revolutionary committee  and scribbling on bits of paper as they run these were commissars despatched to the four corners of russia to carry the news  argue  or fight with whatever arguments or weapons came to hand      the congress was to meet at one o clock  and long since the great meeting hall had filled  but by seven there was yet no sign of the presidium     the bolshevik and left social revolutionary factions were in session in their own rooms  all the livelong afternoon lenin and trotzky had fought against compromise  a considerable part of the bolsheviki were in favour of giving way so far as to create a joint all socialist government   we can t hold on   they cried    too much is against us  we haven t got the men  we will be isolated  and the whole thing will fall   so kameniev  riazanov and others   but lenin  with trotzky beside him  stood firm as a rock   let the compromisers accept our programme and they can come in  we won t give way an inch  if there are comrades here who haven t the courage and the will to dare what we dare  let them leave with the rest of the cowards and conciliators  backed by the workers and soldiers we shall go on    at five minutes past seven came word from the left socialist revolutionaries to say that they would remain in the military revolutionary committee    see   said lenin   they are following    a little later  as we sat at the press table in the big hall  an anarchist who was writing for the bourgeois papers proposed to me that we go and find out what had become of the presidium  there was nobody in the  tsay ee kah  office  nor in the bureau of the petrograd soviet  from room to room we wandered  through vast smolny  nobody seemed to have the slightest idea where to find the governing body of the congress  as we went my companion described his ancient revolutionary activities  his long and pleasant exile in france     as for the bolsheviki  he confided to me that they were common  rude  ignorant persons  without aesthetic sensibilities  he was a real specimen of the russian  intelligentzia      so he came at last to room 17  office of the military revolutionary committee  and stood there in the midst of all the furious coming and going  the door opened  and out shot a squat  flat faced man in a uniform without insignia  who seemed to be smiling which smile  after a minute  one saw to be the fixed grin of extreme fatigue  it was krylenko   my friend  who was a dapper  civilized looking young man  gave a cry of pleasure and stepped forward    nicolai vasilievitch   he said  holding out his hand   don t you remember me  comrade  we were in prison together    krylenko made an effort and concentrated his mind and sight   why yes   he answered finally  looking the other up and down with an expression of great friendliness   you are s    zdra stvuitye    they kissed   what are you doing in all this   he waved his arm around    oh  i am just looking on     you seem very successful     yes   replied krylenko  with a sort of doggedness   the proletarian revolution is a great success   he laughed   perhaps perhaps  however  we ll meet in prison again    when we got out into the corridor again my friend went on with his explanations   you see  i am a follower of kropotkin  to us the revolution is a great failure  it has not aroused the patriotism of the masses  of course that only proves that the people are not ready for revolution       it was just 8 40 when a thundering wave of cheers announced the entrance of the presidium  with lenin great lenin among them  a short  stocky figure  with a big head set down in his shoulders  bald and bulging  little eyes  a snubbish nose  wide  generous mouth  and heavy chin  clean shaven now  but already beginning to bristle with the well known beard of his past and future  dressed in shabby clothes  his trousers much too long for him  unimpressive  to be the idol of a mob  loved and revered as perhaps few leaders in history have been  a strange popular leader a leader purely by virtue of intellect  colourless  humourless  uncompromising and detached  without picturesque idiosyncrasies but with the power of explaining profound ideas in simple terms  of analysing a concrete situation  and combined with shrewdness  the greatest intellectual audacity   kameniev was reading the report of the actions of the military revolutionary committee  abolition of capital punishment in the army  restoration of the free right of propaganda  release of officers and soldiers arrested for political crimes  orders to arrest kerensky and confiscation of food supplies in private store houses     tremendous applause   again the representative of the  bund   the uncompromising attitude of the bolsheviki would mean the crushing of the revolution  therefore  the  bund  delegates must refuse any longer to sit in the congress  cries from the audience   we thought you walked out last night  how many times are you going to walk out    then the representative of the mensheviki internationalists  shouts   what  you here still   the speaker explained that only part of the mensheviki internationalists left the congress  the rest were going to stay    we consider it dangerous and perhaps even mortal for the revolution to transfer the power to the soviets  interruptions  but we feel it our duty to remain in the congress and vote against the transfer here    other speakers followed  apparently without any order  a delegate of the coal miners of the don basin called upon the congress to take measures against kaledin  who might cut off coal and food from the capital  several soldiers just arrived from the front brought the enthusiastic greetings of their regiments     now lenin  gripping the edge of the reading stand  letting his little winking eyes travel over the crowd as he stood there waiting  apparently oblivious to the long rolling ovation  which lasted several minutes  when it finished  he said simply   we shall now proceed to construct the socialist order   again that overwhelming human roar    the first thing is the adoption of practical measures to realise peace     we shall offer peace to the peoples of all the belligerent countries upon the basis of the soviet terms no annexations  no indemnities  and the right of self determination of peoples  at the same time  according to our promise  we shall publish and repudiate the secret treaties     the question of war and peace is so clear that i think that i may  without preamble  read the project of a proclamation to the peoples of all the belligerent countries       his great mouth  seeming to smile  opened wide as he spoke  his voice was hoarse not unpleasantly so  but as if it had hardened that way after years and years of speaking and went on monotonously  with the effect of being able to go on forever     for emphasis he bent forward slightly  no gestures  and before him  a thousand simple faces looking up in intent adoration   proclamation to the peoples and governments of all the belligerent nations   the workers  and peasants  government  created by the revolution of november 6th and 7th and based on the soviets of workers   soldiers  and peasants  deputies  proposes to all the belligerent peoples and to their governments to begin immediately negotiations for a just and democratic peace   the government means by a just and democratic peace  which is desired by the immense majority of the workers and the labouring classes  exhausted and depleted by the war that peace which the russian workers and peasants  after having struck down the tsarist monarchy  have not ceased to demand categorically immediate peace without annexations  that is to say  without conquest of foreign territory  without forcible annexation of other nationalities   and without indemnities   the government of russia proposes to all the belligerent peoples immediately to conclude such a peace  by showing themselves willing to enter upon the decisive steps of negotiations aiming at such a peace  at once  without the slightest delay  before the definitive ratification of all the conditions of such a peace by the authorised assemblies of the people of all countries and of all nationalities   by annexation or conquest of foreign territory  the government means conformably to the conception of democratic rights in general  and the rights of the working class in particular all union to a great and strong state of a small or weak nationality  without the voluntary  clear and precise expression of its consent and desire  whatever be the moment when such an annexation by force was accomplished  whatever be the degree civilisation of the nation annexed by force or maintained outside the frontiers of another state  no matter if that nation be in europe or in the far countries across the sea   if any nation is retained by force within the limits of another state  if  in spite of the desire expressed by it   it matters little if that desire be expressed by the press  by popular meetings  decisions of political parties  or by disorders and riots against national oppression   that nation is not given the right of deciding by free vote without the slightest constraint  after the complete departure of the armed forces of the nation which has annexed it or wishes to annex it or is stronger in general the form of its national and political organisation  such a union constitutes an annexation that is to say  conquest and an act of violence   to continue this war in order to permit the strong and rich nations to divide among themselves the weak and conquered nationalities is considered by the government the greatest possible crime against humanity  and the government solemnly proclaims its decision to sign a treaty of peace which will put an end to this war upon the above conditions  equally fair for all nationalities without exception   the government abolishes secret diplomacy  expressing before the whole country its firm decision to conduct all the negotiations in the light of day before the people  and will proceed immediately to the full publication of all secret treaties confirmed or concluded by the government of land owners and capitalists  from march until november 7th  1917  all the clauses of the secret treaties which  as occur in a majority of cases  have for their object to procure advantages and privileges for russian capitalists  to maintain or augment the annexations of the russian imperialists  are denounced by the government immediately and without discussion   in proposing to all governments and all peoples to engage in public negotiations for peace  the government declares itself ready to carry on these negotiations by telegraph  by post  or by pourparlers between the representatives of the different countries  or at a conference of these representatives  to facilitate these pourparlers  the government appoints its authorised representatives in the neutral countries   the government proposes to all the governments and to the peoples of all the belligerent countries to conclude an immediate armistice  at the same time suggesting that the armistice ought to last three months  during which time it is perfectly possible  not only to hold the necessary pourparlers between the representatives of all the nations and nationalities without exception drawn into the war or forced to take part in it  but also to convoke authorised assemblies of representatives of the people of all countries  for the purpose of the definite acceptance of the conditions of peace   in addressing this offer of peace to the governments and to the peoples of all the belligerent countries  the provisional workers  and peasants  government of russia addresses equally and in particular the conscious workers of the three nations most devoted to humanity and the three most important nations among those taking part in the present war england  france  and germany  the workers of these countries have rendered the greatest services to the cause of progress and of socialism  the splendid examples of the chartist movement in england  the series of revolutions  of world wide historical significance  accomplished by the french proletariat and finally  in germany  the historic struggle against the laws of exception  an example for the workers of the whole world of prolonged and stubborn action  and the creation of the formidable organisations of german proletarians all these models of proletarian heroism  these monuments of history  are for us a sure guarantee that the workers of these countries will understand the duty imposed upon them to liberate humanity from the horrors and consequences of war  and that these workers  by decisive  energetic and continued action  will help us to bring to a successful conclusion the cause of peace and at the same time  the cause of the liberation of the exploited working masses from all slavery and all exploitation   when the grave thunder of applause had died away  lenin spoke again    we propose to the congress to ratify this declaration  we address ourselves to the governments as well as to the peoples  for a declaration which would be addressed only to the peoples of the belligerent countries might delay the conclusion of peace  the conditions of peace  drawn up during the armistice  will be ratified by the constituent assembly  in fixing the duration of the armistice at three months  we desire to give to the peoples as long a rest as possible after this bloody extermination  and ample time for them to elect their representatives  this proposal of peace will meet with resistance on the part of the imperialist governments we don t fool ourselves on that score  but we hope that revolution will soon break out in all the belligerent countries  that is why we address ourselves especially to the workers of france  england and germany       the revolution of november 6th and 7th   he ended   has opened the era of the social revolution     the labour movement  in the name of peace and socialism  shall win  and fulfil its destiny      there was something quiet and powerful in all this  which stirred the souls of men  it was understandable why people believed when lenin spoke       by crowd vote it was quickly decided that only representatives of political factions should be allowed to speak on the motion and that speakers should be limited to fifteen minutes   first karelin for the left socialist revolutionaries   our faction had no opportunity to propose amendments to the text of the proclamation  it is a private document of the bolsheviki  but we will vote for it because we agree with its spirit       for the social democrats internationalists kramarov  long  stoop shouldered and near sighted destined to achieve some notoriety as the clown of the opposition  only a government composed of all the socialist parties  he said  could possess the authority to take such important action  if a socialist coalition were formed  his faction would support the entire programme  if not  only part of it  as for the proclamation  the internationalists were in thorough accord with its main points      then one after another  amid rising enthusiasm  ukrainean social democracy  support  lithuanian social democracy  support  populist socialists  support  polish social democracy  support  polish socialists support but would prefer a socialist coalition  lettish social democracy  support     something was kindled in these men  one spoke of the  coming world revolution  of which we are the advance guard   another of  the new age of brotherhood  when all the peoples will become one great family      an individual member claimed the floor   there is contradiction here   he said   first you offer peace without annexations and indemnities  and then you say you will consider all peace offers  to consider means to accept       lenin was on his feet   we want a just peace  but we are not afraid of a revolutionary war     probably the imperialist governments will not answer our appeal but we shall not issue an ultimatum to which it will be easy to say no     if the german proletariat realises that we are ready to consider all offers of peace  that will perhaps be the last drop which overflows the bowl revolution will break out in germany       we consent to examine all conditions of peace  but that doesn t mean that we shall accept them     for some of our terms we shall fight to the end but possibly for others will find it impossible to continue the war     above all  we want to finish the war       it was exactly 10 35 when kameniev asked all in favour of the proclamation to hold up their cards  one delegate dared to raise his hand against  but the sudden sharp outburst around him brought it swiftly down     unanimous   suddenly  by common impulse  we found ourselves on our feet  mumbling together into the smooth lifting unison of the  internationale   a grizzled old soldier was sobbing like a child  alexandra kollontai rapidly winked the tears back  the immense sound rolled through the hall  burst windows and doors and seared into the quiet sky   the war is ended  the war is ended   said a young workman near me  his face shining  and when it was over  as we stood there in a kind of awkward hush  some one in the back of the room     ck of the room                  shouted   comrades  let us remember those who have died for liberty   so we began to sing the funeral march  that slow  melancholy and yet triumphant chant  so russian and so moving  the  internationale  is an alien air  after all  the funeral march seemed the very soul of those dark masses whose delegates sat in this hall  building from their obscure visions a new russia and perhaps more   you fell in the fatal fight  for the liberty of the people  for the honour of the people      you gave up your lives and everything dear to you   you suffered in horrible prisons   you went to exile in chains      without a word you carried your chains because you could not ignore your suffering brothers   because you believed that justice is stronger than the sword      the time will come when your surrendered life will count  that time is near  when tyranny falls the people will rise  great and free   farewell  brothers  you chose a noble path   you are followed by the new and fresh army ready to die and to suffer      farewell  brothers  you chose a noble path   at your grave we swear to fight  to work for freedom and the people s happiness      for this did they lie there  the martyrs of march  in their cold brotherhood grave on mars field  for this thousands and tens of thousands had died in the prisons  in exile  in siberian mines  it had not come as they expected it would come  nor as the  intelligentzia  desired it  but it had come rough  strong  impatient of formulas  contemptuous of sentimentalism  real      lenin was reading the decree on land    1   all private ownership of land is abolished immediately without compensation    2   all land owners  estates  and all lands belonging to the crown  to monasteries  church lands with all their live stock and inventoried property  buildings and all appurtenances  are transferred to the disposition of the township land committees and the district soviets of peasants  deputies until the constituent assembly meets    3   any damage whatever done to the confiscated property which from now on belongs to the whole people  is regarded as a serious crime  punishable by the revolutionary tribunals  the district soviets of peasants  deputies shall take all necessary measures for the observance of the strictest order during the taking over of the land owners  estates  for the determination of the dimensions of the plots of land and which of them are subject to confiscation  for the drawing up of an inventory of the entire confiscated property  and for the strictest revolutionary protection of all the farming property on the land  with all buildings  implements  cattle  supplies of products  etc   passing into the hands of the people    4   for guidance during the realisation of the great land reforms until their final resolution by the constituent assembly  shall serve the following peasant  nakaz   see app  v  sect  3   instructions   drawn up on the basis of 242 local peasant  nakazi  by the editorial board of the   izviestia  of the all russian soviet of peasants  deputies   and published in no 88 of said   izviestia    petrograd  no 88  august 19th  1917    the lands of peasants and of cossacks serving in the army shall not be confiscated    this is not   explained lenin   the project of former minister tchernov  who spoke of  erecting a frame work  and tried to realise reforms from above  from below  on the spot  will be decided the questions of division of the land  the amount of land received by each peasant will vary according to the locality       under the provisional government  the  pomieshtchiki  flatly refused to obey the orders of the land committees those land committees projected by lvov  brought into existence by shingariov  and administered by kerensky    before the debates could begin a man forced his way violently through the crowd in the aisle and climbed upon the platform  it was pianikh  member of the executive committee of the peasants  soviets  and he was mad clean through    the executive committee of the all russian soviets of peasants  deputies protests against the arrest of our comrades  the ministers salazkin and mazlov   he flung harshly in the faces of the crowd   we demand their instant release  they are now in peter paul fortress  we must have immediate action  there is not a moment to lose    another followed him  a soldier with disordered beard and flaming eyes   you sit here and talk about giving the land to the peasants  and you commit an act of tyrants and usurpers against the peasants  chosen representatives  i tell you   he raised his fist   if one hair of their heads is harmed  you ll have a revolt on your hands   the crowd stirred confusedly   then up rose trotzky  calm and venomous  conscious of power  greeted with a roar   yesterday the military revolutionary committee decided to release the socialist revolutionary and menshevik ministers  mazlov  salazkin  gvozdov and maliantovitch on principle  that they are still in peter paul is only because we have had so much to do     they will  however  be detained at their homes under arrest until we have investigated their complicity in the treacherous acts of kerensky during the kornilov affair     never   shouted pianikh   in any revolution have such things been seen as go on here     you are mistaken   responded trotzky   such things have been seen even in this revolution  hundreds of our comrades were arrested in the july days     when comrade kollontai was released from prison by the doctor s orders  avksentiev placed at her door two former agents of the tsar s secret police   the peasants withdrew  muttering  followed by ironical hoots   the representative of the left socialist revolutionaries spoke on the land decree  while agreeing in principle  his faction could not vote on the question until after discussion  the peasants  soviets should be consulted      the mensheviki internationalists  too  insisted on a party caucus   then the leader of the maximalists  the anarchist wing of the peasants   we must do honour to a political party which puts such an act into effect the first day  without jawing about it    a typical peasant was in the tribune  long hair  boots and sheep skin coat  bowing to all corners of the hall   i wish you well  comrades and citizens   he said   there are some cadets walking around outside  you arrested our socialist peasants why not arrest them    this was the signal for a debate of excited peasants  it was precisely like the debate of soldiers of the night before  here were the real proletarians of the land       those members of our executive committee  avksentiev and the rest  whom we thought were the peasants  protectors they are only cadets too  arrest them  arrest them    another   who are these pianikhs  these avksentievs  they are not peasants at all  they only wag their tails    how the crowd rose to them  recognising brothers   the left socialist revolutionaries proposed a half hour intermission  as the delegates streamed out  lenin stood up in his place    we must not lose time  comrades  news all important to russia must be on the press to morrow morning  no delay    and above the hot discussion  argument  shuffling of feet could be heard the voice of an emissary of the military revolutionary committee  crying   fifteen agitators wanted in room 17 at once  to go to the front  hellip   it was almost two hours and a half later that the delegates came straggling back  the presidium mounted the platform  and the session recommenced by the reading of telegrams from regiment after regiment  announcing their adhesion to the military revolutionary committee   in leisurely manner the meeting gathered momentum  a delegate from the russian troops on the macedonian front spoke bitterly of their situation   we suffer there more from the friendship of our  allies  than from the enemy   he said  representatives of the tenth and twelfth armies  just arrived in hot haste  reported   we support you with all our strength   a peasant soldier protested against the release of  the traitor socialists  mazlov and salazkin   as for the executive committee of the peasants  soviets  it should be arrested  en masse  here was real revolutionary talk     a deputy from the russian army in persia declared he was instructed to demand all power to the soviets     a ukrainean officer  speaking in his native tongue   there is no nationalism in this crisis      da zdravstvuyet  the proletarian dictatorship of all lands   such a deluge of high and hot thoughts that surely russia would never again be dumb   kameniev remarked that the anti bolshevik forces were trying to stir up disorders everywhere  and read an appeal of the congress to all the soviets of russia   the all russian congress of soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies  including some peasants  deputies  calls upon the local soviets to take immediate energetic measures to oppose all counter revolutionary anti jewish action and all  pogroms   whatever they may be  the honour of the workers   peasants  and soldiers  revolution demands that no  pogrom  be tolerated   the red guard of petrograd  the revolutionary garrison and the sailors have maintained complete order in the capital   workers  soldiers and peasants  you should follow everywhere the example of the workers and soldiers of petrograd   comrade soldiers and cossacks  on us falls the duty of assuring real revolutionary order   all revolutionary russia and the entire world have their eyes on us      at two o clock the land decree was put to vote  with only one against and the peasant delegates wild with joy     so plunged the bolsheviki ahead  irresistible  over riding hesitation and opposition the only people in russia who had a definite programme of action while the others talked for eight long months   now arose a soldier  gaunt  ragged and eloquent  to protest against the clause of the  nakaz  tending to deprive military deserters from a share in village land allotments  bawled at and hissed at first  his simple  moving speech finally made silence   forced against his will into the butchery of the trenches   he cried   which you yourselves  in the peace decree  have voted senseless as well as horrible  he greeted the revolution with hope of peace and freedom  peace  the government of kerensky forced him again to go forward into galicia to slaughter and be slaughtered  to his pleas for peace  terestchenko simply laughed     freedom  under kerensky he found his committees suppressed  his newspapers cut off  his party speakers put in prison     at home in his village  the landlords were defying his land committees  jailing his comrades     in petrograd the bourgeoisie  in alliance with the germans  were sabotaging the food and ammunition for the army     he was without boots  or clothes     who forced him to desert  the government of kerensky  which you have overthrown   at the end there was applause   but another soldier hotly denounced it   the government of kerensky is not a screen behind which can be hidden dirty work like desertion  deserters are scoundrels  who run away home and leave their comrades to die in the trenches alone  every deserter is a traitor  and should be punished      uproar  shouts of   do volno  teesche    kameniev hastily proposed to leave the matter to the government for decision   see app  v  sect  4   at 2 30 a  m  fell a tense hush  kameniev was reading the decree of the constitution of power   until the meeting of the constituent assembly  a provisional workers  and peasants  government is formed  which shall be named the council of people s commissars   see app  v  sect  5   the administration of the different branches of state activity shall be intrusted to commissions  whose composition shall be regulated to ensure the carrying out of the programme of the congress  in close union with the mass organisations of working men  working women  sailors  soldiers  peasants and clerical employees  the governmental power is vested in a  collegium  made up of the chairmen of these commissions  that is to say  the council of people s commissars   control over the activities of the people s commissars  and the right to replace them  shall belong to the all russian congress of soviets of workers   peasants  and soldiers  deputies  and its central executive committee   still silence  as he read the list of commissars  bursts of applause after each name  lenin s and trotzky s

djougashvili   stalin     railroads   to be filled later   there were bayonets at the edges of the room  bayonets pricking up among the delegates  the military revolutionary committee was arming everybody  bolshevism was arming for the decisive battle with kerensky  the sound of whose trumpets came up the south west wind     in the meanwhile nobody went home  on the contrary hundreds of newcomers filtered in  filling the great room solid with stern faced soldiers and workmen who stood for hours and hours  indefatigably intent  the air was thick with cigarette smoke  and human breathing  and the smell of coarse clothes and sweat   avilov of the staff of  novaya zhizn  was speaking in the name of the social democrat internationalists and the remnant of the mensheviki internationalists  avilov  with his young  intelligent face  looking out of place in his smart frock coat    we must ask ourselves where we are going     the ease with which the coalition government was upset cannot be explained by the strength of the left wing of the democracy  but only by the incapacity of the government to give the people peace and bread  and the left wing cannot maintain itself in power unless it can solve these questions       can it give bread to the people  grain is scarce  the majority of the peasants will not be with you  for you cannot give them the machinery they need  fuel and other primary necessities are almost impossible to procure       as for peace  that will be even more difficult  the allies refused to talk with skobeliev  they will never accept the proposition of a peace conference from  you   you will not be recognised either in london and paris  or in berlin       you cannot count on the effective help of the proletariat of the allied countries  because in most countries it is very far from the revolutionary struggle  remember  the allied democracy was unable even to convoke the stockholm conference  concerning the german social democrats  i have just talked with comrade goldenberg  one of our delegates to stockholm  he was told by the representatives of the extreme left that revolution in germany was impossible during the war      here interruptions began to come thick and fast  but avilov kept on    the isolation of russia will fatally result either in the defeat of the russian army by the germans  and the patching up of a peace between the austro german coalition and the franco british coalition  at the expense of russia  or in a separate peace with germany    i have just learned that the allied ambassadors are preparing to leave  and that committees for salvation of country and revolution are forming in all the cities of russia       no one party can conquer these enormous difficulties  the majority of the people  supporting a government of socialist coalition  can alone accomplish the revolution       he then read the resolution of the two factions   recognising that for the salvation of the conquests of the revolution it is indispensable immediately to constitute a government based on the revolutionary democracy organised in the soviets of workers   soldiers  and peasants  deputies  recognising moreover that the task of this government is the quickest possible attainment of peace  the transfer of the land into the hands of the agrarian committees  the organisation of control over industrial production  and the convocation of the constituent assembly on the date decided  the congress appoints an executive committee to constitute such a government after an agreement with the groups of the democracy which are taking part in the congress   in spite of the revolutionary exaltation of the triumphant crowd  avilov s cool tolerant reasoning had shaken them  toward the end  the cries and hisses died away  and when he finished there was even some clapping   karelin followed him also young  fearless  whose sincerity no one doubted for the left socialist revolutionaries  the party of maria spiridonova  the party which almost alone followed the bolsheviki  and which represented the revolutionary peasants    our party has refused to enter the council of people s commissars because we do not wish forever to separate ourselves from the part of the revolutionary army which left the congress  a separation which would make it impossible for us to serve as intermediaries between the bolsheviki and the other groups of the democracy     and that is our principal duty at this moment  we cannot sustain any government except a government of socialist coalition       we protest  moreover  against the tyrannical conduct of the bolsheviki  our commissars have been driven from their posts  our only organ   znamia truda   banner of labour   was forbidden to appear yesterday       the central duma is forming a powerful committee for salvation of country and revolution  to fight you  already you are isolated  and your government is without the support of a single other democratic group      and now trotzky stood upon the raised tribune  confident and dominating  with that sarcastic expression about his mouth which was almost a sneer  he spoke  in a ringing voice  and the great crowd rose to him    these considerations on the dangers of isolation of our party are not new  on the eve of insurrection our fatal defeat was also predicted  everybody was against us  only a faction of the socialist revolutionaries of the left was with us in the military revolutionary committee  how is it that we were able to overturn the government almost without bloodshed      that fact is the most striking proof that we  were not isolated   in reality the provisional government was isolated  the democratic parties which march against us were isolated  are isolated  and forever cut off from the proletariat    they speak of the necessity for a coalition  there is only one coalition possible the coalition of the workers  soldiers and poorest peasants  and it is our party s honour to have realised that coalition     what sort of coalition did avilov mean  a coalition with those who supported the government of treason to the people  coalition doesn t always add to strength  for example  could we have organised the insurrection with dan and avksentiev in our ranks   roars of laughter    avksentiev gave little bread  will a coalition with the  oborontsi  furnish more  between the peasants and avksentiev  who ordered the arrest of the land committees  we choose the peasants  our revolution will remain the classic revolution of history       they accuse us of repelling an agreement with the other democratic parties  but is it we who are to blame  or must we  as karelin put it  blame it on a  misunderstanding   no  comrades  when a party in full tide of revolution  still wreathed in powder smoke  comes to say   here is the power take it   and when those to whom it is offered go over to the enemy  that is not a misunderstanding     that is a declaration of pitiless war  and it isn t we who have declared war       avilov menaces us with failure of our peace efforts if we remain  isolated   i repeat  i don t see how a coalition with skobeliev  or even terestchenko  can help us to get peace  avilov tries to frighten us by the threat of a peace at our expense  and i answer that in any case  if europe continues to be ruled by the imperialist bourgeoisie  revolutionary russia will inevitably be lost       there are only two alternatives  either the russian revolution will create a revolutionary movement in europe  or the european powers will destroy the russian revolution    they greeted him with an immense crusading acclaim  kindling to the daring of it  with the thought of championing mankind  and from that moment there was something conscious and decided about the insurrectionary masses  in all their actions  which never left them   but on the other side  too  battle was taking form  kameniev recognised a delegate from the union of railway workers  a hardfaced  stocky man with an attitude of implacable hostility  he threw a bombshell    in the name of the strongest organisation in russia i demand the right to speak  and i say to you  the  vikzhel charges me to make known the decision of the union concerning the constitution of power  the central committee refuses absolutely to support the bolsheviki if they persist in isolating themselves from the whole democracy of russia   immense tumult all over the hall    in 1905  and in the kornilov days  the railway workers were the best defenders of the revolution  but you did not invite us to your congress   cries   it was the old  tsay ee kah  which did not invite you   the orator paid no attention   we do not recognise the legality of this congress  since the departure of the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries there is not a legal quorum     the union supports the old  tsay ee kah   and declares that the congress has no right to elect a new committee       the power should be a socialist and revolutionary power  responsible before the authorised organs of the entire revolutionary democracy  until the constitution of such a power  the union of railway workers  which refuses to transport counter revolutionary troops to petrograd  at the same time forbids the execution of any order whatever without the consent of the  vikzhel   the  vikzhel  also takes into its hands the entire administration of the railroads of russia    at the end he could hardly be heard for the furious storm of abuse which beat upon him  but it was a heavy blow that could be seen in the concern on the faces of the presidium  kameniev  however  merely answered that there could be no doubt of the legality of the congress  as even the quorum established by the old  tsay ee kah  was exceeded in spite of the secession of the mensheviki and socialist revolution arises      then came the vote on the constitution of power  which carried the council of people s commissars into office by an enormous majority      the election of the new  tsay ee kah   the new parliament of the russian republic  took barely fifteen minutes  trotzky announced its composition  100 members  of which 70 bolsheviki     as for the peasants  and the seceding factions  places were to be reserved for them   we welcome into the government all parties and groups which will adopt our programme   ended trotzky   and thereupon the second all russian congress of soviets was dissolved  so that the members might hurry to their homes in the four corners of russia and tell of the great happenings      it was almost seven when we woke the sleeping conductors and motor men of the street cars which the street railway workers  union always kept waiting at smolny to take the soviet delegates to their homes  in the crowded car there was less happy hilarity than the night before  i thought  many looked anxious  perhaps they were saying to themselves   now we are masters  how can we do our will    at our apartment house we were held up in the dark by an armed patrol of citizens and carefully examined  the duma s proclamation was doing its work      the landlady heard us come in  and stumbled out in a pink silk wrapper   the house committee has again asked that you take your turn on guard duty with the rest of the men   she said    what s the reason for this guard duty     to protect the house and the women and children     who from     robbers and murderers     but suppose there came a commissar from the military revolutionary committee to search for arms     oh  that s what they ll  say  they are     and besides  what s the difference    i solemnly affirmed that the consul had forbidden all american citizens to carry arms especially in the neighbourhood of the russian  intelligentzia                                     chapter vi                        the committee for salvation  friday  november 9th      novotcherkask  november 8th   in view of the revolt of the bolsheviki  and their attempt to depose the provisional government and to seize the power in petrograd    the cossack government declares that it considers these acts criminal and absolutely inadmissible  in consequence  the cossacks will lend all their support to the provisional government  which is a government of coalition  because of these circumstances  and until the return of the provisional government to power  and the restoration of order in russia  i take upon myself  beginning november 7th  all the power in that which concerns the region of the don   signed  ataman kaledin   president of the government of the cossack troops     prikaz  of the minister president kerensky  dated at gatchina   i  minister president of the provisional government  and supreme commander of all the armed forces of the russian republic  declare that i am at the head of regiments from the front who have remained faithful to the fatherland   i order all the troops of the military district of petrograd  who through mistake or folly have answered the appeal of the traitors to the country and the revolution  to return to their duty without delay   this order shall be read in all regiments  battalions and squadrons   signed   minister president of the provisional    government and supreme commander   a  f  kerensky   telegram from kerensky to the general in command of the northern front   the town of gatchina has been taken by the loyal regiments without bloodshed  detachments of cronstadt sailors  and of the semionovsky and ismailovsky regiments  gave up their arms without resistance and joined the government troops   i order all the designated units to advance as quickly as possible  the military revolutionary committee has ordered its troops to retreat      gatchina  about thirty kilometers south west  had fallen during the night  detachments of the two regiments mentioned not the sailors while wandering captainless in the neighbourhood  had indeed been surrounded by cossacks and given up their arms  but it was not true that they had joined the government troops  at this very moment crowds of them  bewildered and ashamed  were up at smolny trying to explain  they did not think the cossacks were so near     they had tried to argue with the cossacks      apparently the greatest confusion prevailed along the revolutionary front  the garrisons of all the little towns southward had split hopelessly  bitterly into two factions or three  the high command being on the side of kerensky  in default of anything stronger  the majority of the rank and file with the soviets  and the rest unhappily wavering   hastily the military revolutionary committee appointed to command the defence of petrograd an ambitious regular army captain  muraviov  the same muraviov who had organised the death battalions during the summer  and had once been heard to advise the government that  it was too lenient with the bolsheviki  they must be wiped out   a man of military mind  who admired power and audacity  perhaps sincerely      beside my door when i came down in the morning were posted two new orders of the military revolutionary committee  directing that all shops and stores should open as usual  and that all empty rooms and apartments should be put at the disposal of the committee      for thirty six hours now the bolsheviki had been cut off from provincial russia and the outside world  the railway men and telegraphers refused to transmit their despatches  the postmen would not handle their mail  only the government wireless at tsarskoye selo launched half hourly bulletins and manifestoes to the four corners of heaven  the commissars of smolny raced the commissars of the city duma on speeding trains half across the earth  and two aeroplanes  laden with propaganda  fled high up toward the front      but the eddies of insurrection were spreading through russia with a swiftness surpassing any human agency  helsingfors soviet passed resolutions of support  kiev bolsheviki captured the arsenal and the telegraph station  only to be driven out by delegates to the congress of cossacks  which happened to be meeting there  in kazan  a military revolutionary committee arrested the local garrison staff and the commissar of the provisional government  from far krasnoyarsk  in siberia  came news that the soviets were in control of the municipal institutions  at moscow  where the situation was aggravated by a great strike of leather workers on one side  and a threat of general lock out on the other  the soviets had voted overwhelmingly to support the action of the bolsheviki in petrograd     already a military revolutionary committee was functioning   everywhere the same thing happened  the common soldiers and the industrial workers supported the soviets by a vast majority  the officers   yunkers  and middle class generally were on the side of the government as were the bourgeois cadets and the  moderate  socialist parties  in all these towns sprang up committees for salvation of country and revolution  arming for civil war      vast russia was in a state of solution  as long ago as 1905 the process had begun  the march revolution had merely hastened it  and giving birth to a sort of forecast of the new order  had ended by merely perpetuating the hollow structure of the old regime  now  however  the bolsheviki  in one night  had dissipated it  as one blows away smoke  old russia was no more  human society flowed molten in primal heat  and from the tossing sea of flame was emerging the class struggle  stark and pitiless and the fragile  slowly cooling crust of new planets      in petrograd sixteen ministries were on strike  led by the ministries of labour and of supplies the only two created by the all socialist government of august   if ever men stood alone the  handful of bolsheviki  apparently stood alone that grey chill morning  with all storms towering over them   see app  vi  sect  1  back against the wall  the military revolutionary committee struck for its life    de l audace  encore de l audace  et toujours de l audace      at five in the morning the red guards entered the printing office of the city government  confiscated thousands of copies of the appeal protest of the duma  and suppressed the official municipal organ the  viestnik gorodskovo samoupravleniya   bulletin of the municipal self government   all the bourgeois newspapers were torn from the presses  even the  golos soldata   journal of the old  tsay ee kah  which  however  changing its name to  soldatski golos   appeared in an edition of a hundred thousand copies  bellowing rage and defiance   the men who began their stroke of treachery in the night  who have suppressed the newspapers  will not keep the country in ignorance long  the country will know the truth  it will appreciate you  messrs  the bolsheviki  we shall see      as we came down the nevsky a little after midday the whole street before the duma building was crowded with people  here and there stood red guards and sailors  with bayonetted rifles  each one surrounded by about a hundred men and women clerks  students  shopkeepers   tchinovniki  shaking their fists and bawling insults and menaces  on the steps stood boy scouts and officers  distributing copies of the  soldatski golos   a workman with a red band around his arm and a revolver in his hand stood trembling with rage and nervousness in the middle of a hostile throng at the foot of the stairs  demanding the surrender of the papers     nothing like this  i imagine  ever occurred in history  on one side a handful of workmen and common soldiers  with arms in their hands  representing a victorious insurrection and perfectly miserable  on the other a frantic mob made up of the kind of people that crowd the sidewalks of fifth avenue at noon time  sneering  abusing  shouting   traitors  provocators   opritchniki           savage body guards if ian the terrible  17th century   the doors were guarded by students and officers with white arm bands lettered in red   militia of the committee of public safety   and half a dozen boy scouts came and went  upstairs the place was all commotion  captain gomberg was coming down the stairs   they re going to dissolve the duma   he said   the bolshevik commissar is with the mayor now   as we reached the top riazanov came hurrying out  he had been to demand that the duma recognise the council of peoples  commissars  and the mayor had given him a flat refusal   in the offices a great babbling crowd  hurrying  shouting  gesticulating government officials  intellectuals  journalists  foreign correspondents  french and british officers      the city engineer pointed to them triumphantly   the embassies recognise the duma as the only power now   he explained   for these bolshevik murderers and robbers it is only a question of hours  all russia is rallying to us      in the alexander hall a monster meeting of the committee for salvation  fillipovsky in the chair and skobeliev again in the tribune  reporting  to

power of the soviets is not democratic power  but a dictatorship and not the dictatorship of the proletariat  but  against  the proletariat  all those who have felt or know how to feel revolutionary enthusiasm must join now for the defence of the revolution       the problem of the day is not only to render harmless irresponsible demagogues  but to fight against the counter revolution     if rumours are true that certain generals in the provinces are attempting to profit by events in order to march on petrograd with other designs  it is only one more proof that we must establish a solid base of democratic government  otherwise  troubles with the right will follow troubles from the left       the garrison of petrograd cannot remain indifferent when citizens buying the  golos soldata  and newsboys selling the  rabotchaya gazeta  are arrested in the streets       the hour of resolutions has passed     let those who have no longer faith in the revolution retire     to establish a united power  we must again restore the prestige of the revolution       let us swear that either the revolution shall be saved or we shall perish    the hall rose  cheering  with kindling eyes  there was not a single proletarian anywhere in sight      then weinstein    we must remain calm  and not act until public opinion is firmly grouped in support of the committee for salvation then we can pass from the defensive to action    the  vikzhel  representative announced that his organisation was taking the initiative in forming the new government  and its delegates were now discussing the matter with smolny     followed a hot discussion  were the bolsheviki to be admitted to the new government  martov pleaded for their admission  after all  he said  they represented an important political party  opinions were very much divided upon this  the right wing mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries  as well as the populist socialists  the cooperatives and the bourgeois elements being bitterly against       they have betrayed russia   one speaker said   they have started civil war and opened the front to the germans  the bolsheviki must be mercilessly crushed       skobeliev was in favor of excluding both the bolsheviki and the cadets   we got into conversation with a young socialist revolutionary  who had walked out of the democratic conference to gether with the bolsheviki  that night when tseretelli and the  compromisers  forced coalition upon the democracy of russia    you here   i asked him   his eyes flashed fire   yes   he cried   i left the congress with my party wednesday night  i have not risked my life for twenty years and more to submit now to the tyranny of the dark people  their methods are intolerable  but they have not counted on the peasants     when the peasants begin to act  then it is a question of minutes before they are done for     but the peasants will they act  doesn t the land decree settle the peasants  what more do they want     ah  the land decree   he said furiously   yes  do you know what that land decree is  it is  our  decree it is the socialist revolutionary programme  intact  my party framed that policy  after the most careful compilation of the wishes of the peasants themselves  it is an outrage        but if it is your own policy  why do you object  if it is the peasants  wishes  why will they oppose it     you don t understand  don t you see that the peasants will immediately realise that it is all a trick that these usurpers have stolen the socialist revolutionary programme    i asked if it were true that kaledin was marching north   he nodded  and rubbed his hands with a sort of bitter satisfaction   yes  now you see what these bolsheviki have done  they have raised the counter revolution against us  the revolution is lost  the revolution is lost     but won t you defend the revolution     of course we will defend it to the last drop of our blood  but we won t cooperate with the bolsheviki in any way        but if kaledin comes to petrograd  and the bolsheviki defend the city  won t you join with them     of course not  we will defend the city also  but we won t support the bolsheviki  kaledin is the enemy of the revolution  but the bolsheviki are equally enemies of the revolution     which do you prefer kaledin or the bolsheviki     it is not a question to be discussed   he burst out impatiently   i tell you  the revolution is lost  and it is the bolsheviki who are to blame  but listen why should we talk of such things  kerensky is comming     day after tomorrow we shall pass to the offensive     already smolny has sent delegates inviting us to form a new government  but we have them now they are absolutely impotent     we shall not cooperate       outside there was a shot  we ran to the windows  a red guard  finally exasperated by the taunts of the crowd  had shot into it  wounding a young girl in the arm  we could see her being lifted into a cab  surrounded by an excited throng  the clamour of whose voices floated up to us  as we looked  suddenly an armoured automobile appeared around the corner of the mikhailovsky  its guns sluing this way and that  immediately the crowd began to run  as petrograd crowds do  falling down and lying still in the street  piled in the gutters  heaped up behind telephone poles  the car lumbered up to the steps of the duma and a man stuck his head out of the turret  demanding the surrender of the  soldatski golos   the boy scouts jeered and scuttled into the building  after a moment the automobile wheeled undecidedly around and went off up the nevsky  while some hundreds of men and women picked themselves up and began to dust their clothes      inside was a prodigious running about of people with armfuls of  soldatski golos   looking for places to hide them      a journalist came running into the room  waving a paper    here s a proclamation from krasnov   he cried  everybody crowded around   get it printed get it printed quick  and around to the barracks    by the order of the supreme commander i am appointed commandant of the troops concentrated under petrograd   citizens  soldiers  valorous cossacks of the don  of the kuban  of the transbaikal  of the amur  of the yenissei  to all you who have remained faithful to your oath i appeal  to you who have sworn to guard inviolable your oath of cossack i call upon you to save petrograd from anarchy  from famine  from tyranny  and to save russia from the indelible shame to which a handful of ignorant men  bought by the gold of wilhelm  are trying to submit her   the provisional government  to which you swore fidelity in the great days of march  is not overthrown  but by violence expelled from the edifice in which it held its meetings  however the government  with the help of the front armies  faithful to their duty  with the help of the council of cossacks  which has united under its command all the cossacks and which  strong with the morale which reigns in its ranks  and acting in accordance with the will of the russian people  has sworn to serve the country as its ancestors served it in the troublous times of 1612  when the cossacks of the don delivered moscow  menaced by the swedes  the poles  and the lithuanians  your government still exists      the active army considers these criminals with horror and contempt  their acts of vandalism and pillage  their crimes  the german mentality with which they regard russia stricken down but not yet surrendered have alienated from them the entire people   citizens  soldiers  valorous cossacks of the garrison of petrograd  send me your delegates so that i may know who are traitors to their country and who are not  that there may be avoided an effusion of innocent blood   almost the same moment word ran from group to group that the building was surrounded by red guards  an officer strode in  a red band around his arm  demanding the mayor  a few minutes later he left and old schreider came out of his office  red and pale by turns    a special meeting of the duma   he cried   immediately    in the big hall proceedings were halted   all members of the duma for a special meeting     what s the matter     i don t know going to arrest us going to dissolve the duma arresting members at the door   so ran the excited comments   in the nicolai hall there was barely room to stand  the mayor announced that troops were stationed at all the doors  prohibiting all exit and entrance  and that a commissar had threatened arrest and the dispersal of the municipal duma  a flood of impassioned speeches from members  and even from the galleries  responded  the freely elected city government could not be dissolved by  any  power  the mayor s person and that of all the members were inviolable  the tyrants  the provocators  the german agents should never be recognised  as for these threats to dissolve us  let them try only over our dead bodies shall they seize this chamber  where like the roman senators of old we await with dignity the coming of the goths      resolution  to inform the dumas and zemstvos of all russia by telegraph  resolution  that it was impossible for the mayor or the chairman of the duma to enter into any relations whatever with representatives of the military revolutionary committee or with the so called council of people s commissars  resolution  to address another appeal to the population of petrograd to stand up for the defence of their elected town government  resolution  to remain in permanent session      in the meanwhile one member arrived with the information that he had telephoned to smolny  and that the military revolutionary committee said that no orders had been given to surround the duma  that the troops would be withdrawn      as we went downstairs riazanov burst in through the front door  very agitated    are you going to dissolve the duma   i asked    my god  no   he answered   it is all a mistake  i told the mayor this morning that the duma would be left alone      out on the nevsky  in the deepening dusk  a long double file of cyclists came riding  guns slung on their shoulders  they halted  and the crowd pressed in and deluged them with questions    who are you  where do you come from   asked a fat old man with a cigar in his mouth    twelfth army  from the front  we came to support the soviets against the damn  bourgeoisie     ah   were furious cries   bolshevik gendarmes  bolshevik cossacks    a little officer in a leather coat came running down the steps   the garrison is turning   he muttered in my ear   it s the beginning of the end of the bolsheviki  do you want to see the turn of the tide  come on   he started at a half trot up the mikhailovsky  and we followed    what regiment is it     the  brunnoviki       here was indeed serious trouble  the  brunnoviki  were the armoured car troops  the key to the situation  whoever controlled the  brunnoviki  controlled the city   the commissars of the committee for salvation and the duma have been talking to them  there s a meeting on to decide       decide what  which side they ll fight on     oh  no  that s not the way to do it  they ll never fight against the bolsheviki  they will vote to remain neutral and then the  yunkers  and cossacks    the door of the great mikhailovsky riding school yawned blackly  two sentinels tried to stop us  but we brushed by hurriedly  deaf to their indignant expostulations  inside only a single arc light burned dimly  high up near the roof of the enormous hall  whose lofty pilasters and rows of windows vanished in the gloom  around dimly squatted the monstrous shapes of the armoured cars  one stood alone in the centre of the place  under the light  and round it were gathered some two thousand dun colored soldiers  almost lost in the immensity of that imperial building  a dozen men  officers  chairmen of the soldiers  committees and speakers  were perched on top of the car  and from the central turret a soldier was speaking  this was khanjunov  who had been president of last summer s all russian congress of  brunnoviki   a lithe  handsome figure in his leather coat with lieutenant s shoulder straps  he stood pleading eloquently for neutrality    it is an awful thing   he said   for russians to kill their russian brothers  there must not be civil war between soldiers who stood shoulder to shoulder against the tsar  and conquered the foreign enemy in battles which will go down in history  what have we  soldiers  got to do with these squabbles of political parties  i will not say to you that the provisional government was a democratic government  we want no coalition with the bourgeoisie no  but we must have a government of the united democracy  or russia is lost  with such a government there will be no need for civil war  and the killing of brother by brother    this sounded reasonable the great hall echoed to the crash of hands and voices   a soldier climbed up  his face white and strained   comrades   he cried   i came from the rumanian front  to urgently tell you all  there must be peace  peace at once  whoever can give us peace  whether it be the bolsheviki or this new government  we will follow  peace  we at the front cannot fight any longer  we cannot fight either germans or russians   with that he leaped down  and a sort of confused agonised sound rose up from all that surging mass  which burst into something like anger when the next speaker  a menshevik  oboronetz   tried to say that the war must go on until the allies were victorious    you talk like kerensky   shouted a rough voice   a duma delegate  pleading for neutrality  him they listened to  muttering uneasily  feeling him not one of them  never have i seen men trying so hard to understand  to decide  they never moved  stood staring with a sort of terrible intentness at the speaker  their brows wrinkled with the effort of thought  sweat standing out on their foreheads  great giants of men with the innocent clear eyes of children and the faces of epic warriors      now a bolshevik was speaking  one of their own men  violently  full of hate  they liked him no more than the other  it was not their mood  for the moment they were lifted out of the ordinary run of common thoughts  thinking in terms of russia  of socialism  the world  as if it depended on them whether the revolution were to live or die      speaker succeeded speaker  debating amid tense silence  roars of approval  or anger  should we come out or not  khanjunov returned  persuasive and sympathetic  but wasn t he an officer  and an  oboronotz   however much he talked of peace  then a workman from vasili ostrov  but him they greeted with   and are  you  going to give us peace  working man   near us some men  many of them officers  formed a sort of  claque  to cheer the advocates of neutrality  they kept shouting   khanjunov  khanjunov   and whistled insultingly when the bolsheviki tried to speak   suddenly the committeemen and officers on top of the automobile began to discuss something with great heat and much gesticulation  the audience shouted to know what was the matter  and all the great mass tossed and stirred  a soldier  held back by one of the officers  wrenched himself loose and held up his hand    comrades   he cried   comrade krylenko is here and wants to speak to us   an outburst of cheers  whistlings  yells of   prosim  prosim  dolby   go ahead  go ahead  down with him   in the midst of which the people s commissar for military affairs clambered up the side of the car  helped by hands before and behind  pushed and pulled from below and above  rising he stood for a moment  and then walked out on the radiator  put his hands on his hips and looked around smiling  a squat  short legged figure  bare headed  with out insignia on his uniform   the  claque  near me kept up a fearful shouting   khanjunov  we want khanjunov  down with him  shut up  down with the traitor   the whole place seethed and roared  then it began to move  like an avalanche bearing down upon us  great black browed men forcing their way through    who is breaking up our meeting   they shouted   who is whistling here   the  claque   rudely burst asunder  went flying nor did it gather again       comrade soliders   began krylenko  in a voice husky with fatigue   i cannot speak well to you  i am sorry  but i have not had any sleep for four nights       i don t need to tell you that i am a soldier  i don t need to tell you that i want peace  what i must say is that the bolshevik party  successful in the workers  and soldiers  revolution  by the help of you and of all the rest of the brave comrades who have of you and of all the rest of the brave comrades who have hurled down forever the power of the blood thirsty bourgeoisie  promised to offer peace to all the peoples  and that has already been done to day   tumultuous applause    you are asked to remain neutral  to remain neutral while the  yunkers  and the death battalions  who are  never  neutral  shoot us down in the streets and bring back to petrograd kerensky or perhaps some other of the gang  kaledin is marching from the don  kerensky is coming from the front  kornilov is raising the  tekhintsi  to repeat his attempt of august  all these mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries who call upon you now to prevent civil war how have they retained the power except by civil war  that civil war which has endured ever since last july  and in which they constantly stood on the side of the bourgeoisie  as they do now    how can i persuade you  if you have made up your minds  the question is very plain  on one side are kerensky  kaledin  kornilov  the mensheviki  socialist revolutionaries  cadets  dumas  officers     they tell us that their objects are good  on the other side are the workers  the soldiers and sailors  the poorest peasants  the government is in your hands  you are the masters  great russia belongs to you  will you give it back    while he spoke  he kept himself up by sheer evident effort of will  and as he went on the deep sincere feeling back of his words broke through the tired voice  at the end he totered  almost falling  a hundred hands reached up to help him down  and the great dim spaces of the hall gave back the surf of sound that beat upon him   khanjunov tried to speak again  but  vote  vote  vote   they cried  at length  giving in  he read the resolution  that the  brunnoviki  withdraw their representative from the military revolutionary committee  and declare their neutrality in the present civil war  all those in favour should go to the right  those opposed  to the left  there was a moment of hesitation  a still expectancy  and then the crowd began to surge faster and faster  stumbling over one another  to the left  hundreds of big soldiers in a solid mass rushing across the dirt floor in the faint light     near us about fifty men were left stranded  stubbornly in favour  and even as the high roof shook under the shock of victorious roaring  they turned and rapidly walked out of the building and  some of them  out of the revolution      imagine this struggle being repeated in every barracks of the city  the district  the whole front  all russia  imagine the sleepless krylenkos  watching the regiments  hurrying from place to place  arguing  threatening  entreating  and then imaging the same in all the locals of every labour union  in the factories  the villages  on the battle ships of the far flung russian fleets  think of the hundreds of thousands of russian men staring up at speakers all over the vast country  workmen  peasants  soldiers  sailors  trying so hard to understand and to choose  thinking so intensely and deciding so unanimously at the end  so was the russian revolution      up at smolny the new council of people s commissars was not idle  already the first decree was on the presses  to be circulated in thousands through the city streets that night  and shipped in bales by every train southward and east   in the name of the government of the russian republic  chosen by the all russian congress of soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies with participation of peasant deputies  the council of people s commissars decrees   1  the elections for the constituent assembly shall take place at the date determined upon november 12   2  all electoral commissions  organs of local self government  soviets of workers   soldiers  and peasants  deputies  and soldiers  organisations on the front should make every effort to assure free and regular elections at the date determined upon   in the name of the government of the russian republic   the president of the council of people s commissars    vladimir ulianov lenin   in the municipal building the duma was in full blast  a member of the council of the republic was talking as we came in  the council  he said  did not consider itself dissolved at all  but merely unable to continue its labours until it secured a new meeting place  in the meanwhile  its committee of elders had determined to enter  en masse  the committee for salvation     this  i may remark parenthetically  is the last time history mentions the council of the russian republic      then followed the customary string of delegates from the ministries  the  vikzhel   the union of posts and telegraphs  for the hundredth time reiterating their determination not to work for the bolshevik usurpers  a  yunker  who had been in the winter palace told a highly coloured tale of the heroism of himself and his comrades  and disgraceful conduct of the red guards all of which was devoutly believed  somebody read aloud an account in the socialist revolutionary paper  narod   which stated that five hundred million rubles  worth of damage had been done in the winter palace  and describing in great detail the loot and breakage   from time to time couriers came from the telephone with news  the four socialist ministers had been released from prison  krylenko had gone to peter paul to tell admiral verderevsky that the ministry of marine was deserted  and to beg him  for the sake of russia  to take charge under the authority of the council of people s commissars  and the old seaman had consented     kerensky was advancing north from gatchina  the bolshevik garrisons falling back before him  smolny had issued another decree  enlarging the powers of the city dumas to deal with food supplies   this last piece of insolence caused an outburst of fury  he  lenin  the usurper  the tyrant  whose commissars had seized the municipal garage  entered the municipal ware houses  were interfering with the supply committees and the distribution of food he presumed to define the limits of power of the free  independent  autonomous city government  one member  shaking his fist  moved to cut off the food of the city if the bolsheviki dared to interfere with the supply committees     another  representative of the special supply committee  reported that the food situation was very grave  and asked that emissaries be sent out to hasten food trains   diedonenko announced dramatically that the garrison was wavering  the semionovsky regiment had already decided to submit to the orders of the socialist revolutionary party  the crews of the torpedo boats on the neva were shaky  seven members were at once appointed to continue the propaganda      then the old mayor stepped into the tribune   comrades and citizens  i have just learned that the prisoners in peter paul are in danger  fourteen  yunkers  of the pavlovsk school have been stripped and tortured by the bolshevik guards  one has gone mad  they are threatening to lynch the ministers   there was a whirlwind of indignation and horror  which only grew more violent when a stocky little woman dressed in grey demanded the floor  and lifted up her hard  metallic voice  this was vera slutskaya  veteran revolutionist and bolshevik member of the duma    that is a lie and a provocation   she said  unmoved at the torrent of abuse   the workers  and peasants  government  which has abolished the death penalty  cannot permit such deeds  we demand that this story be investigated  at once  if there is any truth in it  the government will take energetic measures    a commission composed of members of all parties was immediately appointed  and with the mayor  sent to peter paul to investigate  as we followed them out  the duma was appointing another commission to meet kerensky  to try and avoid bloodshed when he entered the capital      it was midnight when we bluffed our past the guards at the gate of the fortress  and went forward under the faint glimmer of rare electric lights along the side of the church where lie the tombs of the tsars  beneath the slender golden spire and the chimes  which  for months  continued to play  bozhe tsaria khrani      every day at     god save the tsar   noon     the place was deserted  in most of the windows there were not even lights  occasionally we bumped into a burly figure stumbling along in the dark  who answered questions with the usual    ya nieznayu      graphic page 166 pass to reed fromdepartment of prisons    translation follows   pass from the department of prisons of the soviet government to visit freely all prisons of petrograd and cronstadt   translation   commissar chief bureau of prisons 6th of november  1917          no  213 petrograd  smolny institute  room no

generally investigating the condition of the prisoners  and for thorough social information for the purpose of stopping the flood of newspaper lies against demorcracy         chief commissar        secretary  on the left loomed the low dark outline of trubetskoi bastion  that living grave in which so many martyrs of liberty had lost their lives or their reason in the days of the tsar  where the provisional government had in turn shut up the ministers of the tsar  and now the bolsheviki had shut up the ministers of the provisional government   a friendly sailor led us to the office of the commandant  in a little house near the mint  half a dozen red guards  sailors and soldiers were sitting around a hot room full of smoke  in which a samovar steamed cheerfully  they welcomed us with great cordiality  offering tea  the commandant was not in  he was escorting a commission of   sabotazhniki    sabotageurs  from the city duma  who insisted that the  yunkers  were all being murdered  this seemed to amuse them very much  at one side of the room sat a bald headed  dissipated looking little man in a frock coat and a rich fur coat  biting his moustache and staring around him like a cornered rat  he had just been arrested  somebody said  glancing carelessly at him  that he was a minister or something     the little man didn t seem to hear it  he was evidently terrified  although the occupants of the room showed no animosity whatever toward him   i went across and spoke to him in french   count tolstoy   he answered  bowing stiffly   i do not understand why i was arrested  i was crossing the troitsky bridge on my way home when two of these of these persons held me up  i was a commissar of the provisional government attached to the general staff  but in no sense a member of the government       let him go  said a sailor   he s harmless        no   responded the soldier who had brought the prisoner   we must ask the commandant     oh  the commandant   sneered the sailor   what did you make a revolution for  to go on obeying officers    a  praporshtchik  of the pavlovsky regiment was telling us how the insurrection started   the  polk   regiment  was on duty at the general staff the night of the 6th  some of my comrades and i were standing guard  ivan pavlovitch and another man i don t remember his name well  they hid behind the window curtains in the room where the staff was having a meeting  and they heard a great many things  for   any things  for                example  they heard orders to bring the gatchina  yunkers  to petrograd by night  and an order for the cossacks to be ready to march in the morning     the principal points in the city were to be occupied before dawn  then there was the business of opening the bridges  but when they began to talk about surrounding smolny  then ivan pavlovitch couldn t stand it any longer  that minute there was a good deal of coming and going  so he slipped out and came down to the guard room leaving the other comrade to pick up what he could    i was already suspicious that something was going on  automobiles full of officers kept coming  and all the ministers were there  ivan pavlovitch told me what he had heard  it was half past two in the morning  the secretary of the regimental committee was there  so we told him and asked what to do     arrest everybody coming and going    he says  so we began to do it  in an hour we had some officers and a couple of ministers  whom we sent up to smolny right away  but the military revolutionary committee wasn t ready  they didn t know what to do  and pretty soon back came the order to let everybody go and not arrest anybody else  well  we ran all the way to smolny  and i guess we talked for an hour before they finally saw that it was war  it was five o clock when we got back to the staff  and by that time most of them were gone  but we got a few  and the garrison was all on the march       a red guard from vasili ostrov described in great detail what had happened in his district on the great day of the rising   we didn t have any machine guns over there   he said  laughing   and we couldn t get any from smolny  comrade zalking  who was a member of the  uprava   central bureau  of the ward duma  remembered all at once that there was lying in the meeting room of the  uprava  a machinegun which had been captured from the germans  so he and i and another comrade went there  the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries were having a meeting  well  we opened the door and walked right in on them  as they sat around the table twelve or fifteen of them  three of us  when they saw us they stopped talking and just stared  we walked right across the room  uncoupled the machine gun  comrade zalkind picked up one part  i the other  we put them on our shoulders and walked out and not a single man said a word     do you know how the winter palace was captured   asked a third man  a sailor   along about eleven o clock we found out there weren t any more  yunkers  on the neva side  so we broke in the doors and filtered up the different stairways one by one  or in little bunches  when we got to the top of the stairs the  yunkers  held us up and took away our guns  still our fellows kept coming up  little by little  until we had a majority  then we turned around and took away the  yunkers   guns       just then the commandant entered a merry looking young non commissioned officer with his arm in a sling  and deep circles of sleeplessness under his eyes  his eye fell first on the prisoner  who at once began to explain    oh  yes   interrupted the other   you were one of the committee who refused to surrender the staff wednesday afternoon  however  we don t want you  citizen  apologies   he opened the door and waved his arm for count tolstoy to leave  several of the others  especially the red guards  grumbled protests  and the sailor remarked triumphantly    vot   there  didn t i say so    two soldiers now engaged his attention  they had been elected a committee of the fortress garrison to protest  the prisoners  they said  were getting the same food as the guards  when there wasn t even enough to keep a man from being hungry   why should the counter revolutionists be treated so well     we are revolutionists  comrades  not bandits   answered the commandant  he turned to us  we explained that rumours were going about that the  yunkers  were being tortured  and the lives of the ministers threatened  could we perhaps see the prisoners  so as to be able to prove to the world      no   said the young soldier  irritably   i am not going to disturb the prisoners again  i have just been compelled to wake them up they were sure we were going to massacre them     most of the  yunkers  have been released anyway  and the rest will go out to morrow   he turned abruptly away    could we talk to the duma commission  then    the commandant  who was pouring himself a glass of tea  nodded   they are still out in the hall   he said carelessly   indeed they stood there just outside the door  in the feeble light of an oil lamp  grouped around the mayor and talking excitedly    mr  mayor   i said   we are american correspondents  will you please tell us officially the result of your investigations    he turned to us his face of venerable dignity    there is no truth in the reports   he said slowly   except for the incidents which occurred as the ministers were being brought here  they have been treated with every consideration  as for the  yunkers   not one has received the slightest injury       up the nevsky  in the empty after midnight gloom  an interminable column of soldiers shuffled in silence to battle with kerensky  in dim back streets automobiles without lights flitted to and fro  and there was furtive activity in fontanka 6  headquarters of the peasants  soviet  in a certain apartment of a huge building on the nevsky  and in the  injinierny zamok   school of engineers   the duma was illuminated      in smolny institute the military revolutionary committee flashed baleful fire  pounding like an over loaded dynamo                                    chapter vii                            the revolutionary front  saturday  november 10th      citizens   the military revolutionary committee declares that it will not tolerate any violation of revolutionary order      theft  brigandage  assaults and attempts at massacre will be severely punished      following the example of the paris commune  the committee will destroy without mercy any looter or instigator of disorder      quiet lay the city  not a hold up  not a robbery  not even a drunken fight  by night armed patrols went through the silent streets  and on the corners soldiers and red guards squatted around little fires  laughing and singing  in the daytime great crowds gathered on the sidewalks listening to interminable hot debates between students and soldiers  business men and workmen   citizens stopped each other on the street    the cossacks are coming     no        what s the latest     i don t know anything  where s kerensky     they say only eight versts from petrograd     is it true that the bolsheviki have fled to the battleship  avrora      they say so       only the walls screamed  and the few newspapers  denunciation  appeal  decree      an enormous poster carried the hysterical manifesto of the executive committee of the peasant  soviets       they  the bolsheviki  dare to say that they are supported by the soviets of peasants  deputies  and that they are speaking on behalf of the soviets of peasants  deputies      let all working class russia know that this is a lie  and that all the working peasants in the person of the executive committee of the all russian soviets of peasants  deputies refutes with indignation all participation of the organised peasantry in this criminal violation of the will of the working classes      from the soldier section of the socialist revolutionary party   the insane attempt of the bolsheviki is on the eve of collapse  the garrison is divided     the ministries are on strike and bread is getting scarcer  all factions except the few bolsheviki have left the congress  the bolsheviki are alone      we call upon all sane elements to group themselves around the committee for salvation of country and revolution  and to prepare themselves seriously to be ready at the first call of the central committee      in a hand bill the council of the republic recited its wrongs   ceding to the force of bayonets  the council of the republic has been obliged to separate  and temporarily to interrupt its meetings   the usurpers  with the words  liberty and socialism  on their lips  have set up a rule of arbitrary violence  they have arrested the members of the provisional government  closed the newspapers  seized the printing shops    this power must be considered the enemy of the people and the revolution  it is necessary to do battle with it  and to pull it down      the council of the republic  until the resumption of its labours  invites the citizens of the russian republic to group themselves around the    local committees for salvation of country and revolution  which are organising the overthrow of the bolsheviki and the creation of a government capable of leading the country to the constituent assembly    dielo naroda said   a revolution is a rising of all the people     but here what have we  nothing but a handful of poor fools deceived by lenin and trotzky     their decrees and their appeals will simply add to the museum of historical curiosities      and  narodnoye slovo  people sword populistsocialist     workers  and peasants  government   that is only a pipedream  nobody  either in russia or in the countries of our allies  will recognise this  government  or even in the enemy countries      the bourgeois press had temporarily disappeared     pravada  had an account of the first meeting of the new  tsay ee kah   now the parliament of the russian soviet republic  miliutin  commissar of agriculture  remarked that the peasants  executive committee had called an all russian peasant congress for december 13th    but we cannot wait   he said   we must have the backing of the peasants  i propose that  we  call the congress of peasants  and do it immediately      the left socialist revolutionaries agreed  an appeal to the peasants of russia was hastily drafted  and a committee of five elected to carry out the project   the question of detailed plans for distributing the land  and the question of workers  control of industry  were postponed until the experts working on them should submit a report   three decrees  see app  vii  sect  1  were read and approved  first  lenin s  general rules for the press   ordering the suppression of all newspapers inciting to resistance and disobedience to the new government  inciting to criminal acts  or deliberately perverting the news  the decree of moratorium for house rents  and the decree establishing a workers  militia  also orders  one giving the municipal duma power to requisition empty apartments and houses  the other directing the unloading of freight cars in the railroad terminals  to hasten the distribution of necessities and to free the badly needed rolling stock      two hours later the executive committee of the peasants  soviets was sending broadcast over russia the following telegram   the arbitrary organisation of the bolsheviki  which is called  bureau of organisation for the national congress of peasants  is inviting all the peasants  soviets to send delegates to the congress at petrograd      the executive committee of the soviets of peasants  deputies declares that it considers  now as well as before  that it would be dangerous to take away from the provinces at this moment the forces necessary to prepare for elections to the constituent assembly  which is the only salvation of the working class and the country  we confirm the date of the congress of peasants   december 13th    at the duma all was excitement  officers coming and going  the mayor in conference with the leaders of the committee for salvation  a councillor ran in with a copy of kerensky s proclamation  dropped by hundreds from an aeroplane low flying down the nevsky  which threatened terrible vengeance on all who did not submit  and ordered soldiers to lay down their arms and assemble immediately in mars field   the minister president had taken tsarskoye selo  we were told  and was already in the petrograd campagna  five miles away  he would enter the city to morrow in a few hours  the soviet troops in contact with his cossacks were said to be going over to the provisional government  tchernov was somewhere in between  trying to organise the  neutral  troops into a force to halt the civil war   in the city the garrison regiments were leaving the bolsheviki  they said  smolny was already abandoned     all the governmental machinery had stopped functioning  the employees of the state bank had refused to work under commissars from smolny  refused to pay out money to them  all the private banks were closed  the ministries were on strike  even now a committee from the duma was making the rounds of business houses  collecting a fund to pay the salaries of the strikers      trotzky had gone to the ministry of foreign affairs and ordered the clerks to translate the decree on peace into foreign languages  six hundred functionaries had hurled their resignations in his face     shliapnikov  commissar of labour  had commanded all the employees of his ministry to return to their places within twenty four hours  or lose their places and their pension rights  only the door servants had responded     some of the branches of the special food supply committee had suspended work rather than submit to the bolsheviki     in spite of lavish promises of high wages and better conditions  the operators at the telephone exchange would not connect soviet headquarters      the socialist revolutionary party had voted to expel all members who had remained in the congress of soviets  and all who were taking part in the insurrection      news from the provinces  moghilev had declared against the bolsheviki  at kiev the cossacks had overthrown the soviets and arrested all the insurrectionary leaders  the soviet and garrison of luga  thirty thousand strong  affirmed its loyalty to the provisional government  and appealed to all russia to rally around it  kaledin had dispersed all soviets and unions in the don basin  and his forces were moving north      said a representative of the railway workers   yesterday we sent a telegram all over russia demanding that war between the political parties cease at once  and insisting on the formation of a coalition socialist government  otherwise we shall call a strike to morrow night     in the morning there will be a meeting of all factions to consider the question  the bolsheviki seem anxious for an agreement        if they last that long   laughed the city engineer  a stout  ruddy man      as we came up to smolny not abandoned  but busier than ever  throngs of workers and soldiers running in and out  and doubled guards everywhere we met the reporters for the bourgeois and  moderate  socialist papers    threw us out   cried one  from  volia naroda    bonch bruevitch came down to the press bureau and told us to leave  said we were spies   they all began to talk at once   insult  outrage  freedom of the press    in the lobby were great tables heaped with stacks of appeals  proclamations and orders of the military revolutionary committee  workmen and soldiers staggered past  carrying them to waiting automobiles   one began   to the pillory   in this tragic moment through which the russian masses are living  the mensheviki and their followers and the right socialist revolutionaries have betrayed the working class  they have enlisted on the side of kornilov  kerensky and savinkov      they are printing orders of the traitor kerensky and creating a panic in the city  spreading the most ridiculous rumours of mythical victories by that renegade      citizens  don t believe these false rumours  no power can defeat the people s revolution     premier kerensky and his followers await speedy and well deserved punishment      we are putting them in the pillory  we are abandoning them to the enmity of all workers  soldiers  sailors and peasants  on whom they are trying to rivet the ancient chains  they will never be able to wash from their bodies the stain of the people s hatred and contempt   shame and curses to the traitors of the people      the military revolutionary committee had moved into larger quarters  room 17 on the top floor  red guards were at the door  inside  the narrow space in front of the railing was crowded with well dressed persons  outwardly respectful but inwardly full of murder bourgeois who wanted permits for their automobiles  or passports to leave the city  among them many foreigners     bill shatov and peters were on duty  they suspended all other business to read us the latest bulletins   the one hundred seventy ninth reserve regiment offers its unanimous support  five thousand stevedores at the putilov wharves greet the new government  central committee of the trade unions enthusiastic support  the garrison and squadron at reval elect military revolutionary committees to cooperate  and despatch troops  military revolutionary committees control in pskov and minsk  greetings from the soviets of tsaritzin  rovensky on don  tchernogorsk  sevastopol     the finland

city  two companies on duty in the kremlin have gone over to the soviets  but the arsenal is in the hands of colonel diabtsev and his  yunkers   the revolutionary committee demanded arms for the workers  and riabtsev parleyed with them until this morning  when suddenly he sent an ultimatum to the committee  ordering soviet troops to surrender and the committee to disband  fighting has begun      in petrograd the staff submitted to smolny s commissars at once  the  tsentroflot   refusing  was stormed by dybenko and a company of cronstadt sailors  and a new  tsentroflot  set up  supported by the baltic and the black sea battleships      but beneath all the breezy assurance there was a chill premonition  a feeling of uneasiness in the air  kerensky s cossacks were coming fast  they had artillery  skripnik  secretary of the factory shop committees  his face drawn and yellow  assured me that there was a whole army corps of them  but he added  fiercely   they ll never take us alive   petrovsky laughed weariedly   to morrow maybe we ll get a sleep a long one      lozovsky  with his emaciated  red bearded face  said   what chance have we  all alone     a mob against trained soldiers    south and south west the soviets had fled before kerensky  and the garrisons of gatchina  pavlovsk  tsarskoye selo were divided half voting to remain neutral  the rest  without officers  falling back on the capital in the wildest disorder   in the halls they were pasting up bulletins   from krasnoye selo  november 10th  8 a m    to be communicated to all commanders of staffs  commanders in chief  commanders  everywhere and to all  all  all    the ex minister kerensky has sent a deliberately false telegram to every one everywhere to the effect that the troops of revolutionary petrograd have voluntarily surrendered their arms and joined the armies of the former government  the government of treason  and that the soldiers have been ordered by the military revolutionary committee to retreat  the troops of a free people do not retreat nor do they surrender   our troops have left gatchina in order to avoid bloodshed between themselves and their mistaken brother cossacks  and in order to take a more convenient position  which is at present so strong that if kerensky and his companions in arms should even increase their forces ten times  still there would be no cause for anxiety  the spirit of our troops is excellent   in petrograd all is quiet    chief of the defence of petrograd and the petrograd district    lieutenant colonel muraviov   as we left the military revolutionary committee antonov entered  a paper in his hand  looking like a corpse    send this   said he   to all district soviets of workers  deputies and factoryshop committees  the kornilovist bands of kerensky are threatening the approaches to the capital  all the necessary orders have been given to crush mercilessly the counter revolutionary attempt against the people and its conquests   the army and the red guard of the revolution are in need of the immediate support of the workers   we order the ward soviets and factory shop committees   1  to move out the greatest possible number of workers for the digging of trenches  the erection of barricades and reinforcing of wire entanglements   2  wherever it shall be necessary for this purpose to stop work at the factories this shall be done immediately   3  all common and barbed wire available must be assembled  and also all implements for the digging of trenches and the erection of barricades   4  all available arms must be taken   5  the strictest discipline is to be observed  and every one must be ready to support the army of the revolution by all means    chairman of the petrograd soviet of worker s and soldiers  deputies    people s commissar leon trotzky    chairman of the military revolutionary committee    commander in chief podvoisky   as we came out into the dark and gloomy day all around the grey horizon factory whistles were blowing  a hoarse and nervous sound  full of foreboding  by tens of thousands the working people poured out  men and women  by tens of thousands the humming slums belched out their dun and miserable hordes  red petrograd was in danger  cossacks  south and southwest they poured through the shabby streets toward the moskovsky gate  men  women and children  with rifles  picks  spades  rolls of wire  cartridge belts over their working clothes     such an immense  spontaneous outpouring of a city never was seen  they rolled along torrent like  companies of soldiers borne with them  guns  motor trucks  wagons the revolutionary proletariat defending with its breast the capital of the workers  and peasants  republic   before the door of smolny was an automobile  a slight man with thick glasses magnifying his red rimmed eyes  his speech a painful effort  stood leaning against a mud guard with his hands in the pockets of a shabby raglan  a great bearded sailor  with the clear eyes of youth  prowled restlessly about  absently toying with an enormous blue steel revolver  which never left his hand  these were antonov and dybenko   some soldiers were trying to fasten two military bicycles on the running board  the chauffeur violently protested  the enamel would get scratched  he said  true  he was a bolshevik  and the automobile was commandeered from a bourgeois  true  the bicycles were for the use of orderlies  but the chauffeur s professional pride was revolted     so the bicycles were abandoned      the people s commissars for war and marine were going to inspect the revolutionary front wherever that was  could we go with them  certainly not  the automobile only held five the two commissars  two orderlies and the chauffeur  however  a russian acquaintance of mine  whom i will call trusishka  calmly got in and sat down  nor could any argument dislodge him      i see no reason to doubt trusishka s story of the journey  as they went down the suvorovsky prospect some one mentioned food  they might be out three or four days  in a country indifferently well provisioned  they stopped the car  money  the commissar of war looked through his pockets he hadn t a kopek  the commissar of marine was broke  so was the chauffeur  trusishka bought the provisions      just as they turned into the nevsky a tire blew out    what shall we do   asked antonov    commandeer another machine   suggested dybenko  waving his revolver  antonov stood in the middle of the street and signalled a passing machine  driven by a soldier    i want that machine   said antonov    you won t get it   responded the soldier    do you know who i am   antonov produced a paper upon which was written that he had been appointed commander in chief of all the armies of the russian republic  and that every one should obey him without question    i don t care if you re the devil himself   said the soldier  hotly   this machine belongs to the first machine gun regiment  and we re carrying ammunition in it  and you can t have it       the difficulty  however  was solved by the appearance of an old battered taxi cab  flying the italian flag   in time of trouble private cars were registered in the name of foreign consulates  so as to be safe from requisition   from the interior of this was dislodged a fat citizen in an expensive fur coat  and the party continued on its way   arrived at narvskaya zastava  about ten miles out  antonov called for the commandant of the red guard  he was led to the edge of the town  where some few hundred workmen had dug trenches and were waiting for the cossacks    everything all right here  comrade   asked antonov    everything perfect  comrade   answered the commandant    the troops are in excellent spirits     only one thing we have no ammunition        in smolny there are two billion rounds   antonov told him   i will give you an order   he felt in his pockets   has any one a piece of paper    dybenko had none nor the couriers  trusishka had to offer his note book       devil  i have no pencil   cried antonov   who s got a pencil   needless to say  trusishka had the only pencil in the crowd      we who were left behind made for the tsarskoye selo station  up the nevsky  as we passed  red guards were marching  all armed  some with bayonets and some without  the early twilight of winter was falling  heads up they tramped in the chill mud  irregular lines of four  without music  without drums  a red flag crudely lettered in gold   peace  land   floated over them  they were very young  the expression on their faces was that of who know they are going to die     half fearful  half contemptuous  the crowds on the sidewalk watched them pass  in hateful silence       graphic page 184  pass to the northern front   this pass was issued upon the recommendation of trotzky three days after the bolshevik revolution  it gives me the right of free travel to the northern front and an added note on the back extends the permission to all fronts  it will be noticed that the speaks of the  petersburg   instead of the  petrograd  soviet  it was the fashion among thorough going internationalists to abolish all names which smacked of  patriotism   but at the same time  it would not do to restore the  saint                             translation  executive committee petrograd soviet of workers

 for the secretary  at the railroad station nobody knew just where kerensky was  or where the front lay  trains went no further  however  than tsarskoye      our car was full of commuters and country people going home  laden with bundles and evening papers  the talk was all of the bolshevik rising  outside of that  however  one would never have realised that civil war was rending mighty russia in two  and that the train was headed into the zone of battle  through the window we could see  in the swiftly deepening darkness  masses of soldiers going along the muddy road toward the city  flinging out their arms in argument  a freight train  swarming with troops and lit up by huge bonfires  was halted on a siding  that was all  back along the flat horizon the glow of the city s lights faded down the night  a street car crawled distantly along a far flung suburb      tsarskoye selo station was quiet  but knots of soldiers stood here and there talking in low tones and looking uneasily down the empty track in the direction of gatchina  i asked some of them which side they were on   well   said one   we don t exactly know the rights of the matter     there is no doubt that kerensky is a provocator  but we do not consider it right for russian men to be shooting russian men    in the station commandant s office was a big  jovial  bearded common soldier  wearing the red arm band of a regimental committee  our credentials from smolny commanded immediate respect  he was plainly for the soviets  but bewildered    the red guards were here two hours ago  but they went away again  a commissar came this morning  but he returned to petrograd when the cossacks arrived     the cossacks are here then    he nodded  gloomily   there has been a battle  the cossacks came early in the morning  they captured two or three hundred of our men  and killed about twenty five     where are the cossacks     well  they didn t get this far  i don t know just where they are  off that way      he waved his arm vaguely westward   we had dinner an excellent dinner  better and cheaper than could be got in petrograd in the station restaurant  nearby sat a french officer who had just come on foot from gatchina  all was quiet there  he said  kerensky held the town   ah  these russians   he went on   they are original  what a civil war  everything except the fighting    we sallied out into the town  just at the door of the station stood two soldiers with rifles and bayonets fixed  they were surrounded by about a hundred business men  government officials and students  who attacked them with passionate argument and epithet  the soldiers were uncomfortable and hurt  like children unjustly scolded   a tall young man with a supercilious expression  dressed in the uniform of a student  was leading the attack    you realise  i presume   he said insolently   that by taking up arms against your brothers you are making your selves the tools of murderers and traitors     now brother  answered the soldier earnestly   you don t understand  there are two classes  don t you see  the proletariat and the bourgeoisie  we      oh  i know that silly talk   broke in the student rudely   a bunch of ignorant peasants like you hear somebody bawling a few catch words  you don t understand what they mean  you just echo them like a lot of parrots   the crowd laughed   i m a marxian student  and i tell you that this isn t socialism you are fighting for  it s just plain pro german anarchy     oh  yes  i know   answered the soldier  with sweat dripping from his brow   you are an educated man  that is easy to see  and i am only a simple man  but it seems to me      i suppose   interrupted the other contemptuously   that you believe lenin is a real friend of the proletariat     yes  i do   answered the soldier  suffering    well  my friend  do you know that lenin was sent through germany in a closed car  do you know that lenin took money from the germans     well  i don t know much about that   answered the soldier stubbornly   but it seems to me that what he says is what i want to hear  and all the simple men like me  now there are two classes  the bourgeoisie and the proletariat      you are a fool  why  my friend  i spent two years in schl sselburg for revolutionary activity  when you were still shooting down revolutionists and singing  god save the tsar   my name is vasili georgevitch panyin  didn t you ever hear of me     i m sorry to say i never did   answered the soldier with humility   but then  i am not an educated man  you are probably a great hero     i am   said the student with conviction   and i am opposed to the bolsheviki  who are destroying our russia  our free revolution  now how do you account for that    the soldier scratched his head   i can t account for it at all   he said  grimacing with the pain of his intellectual processes   to me it seems perfectly simple but then  i m not well educated  it seems like there are only two classes  the proletariat and the bourgeoisie      there you go again with your silly formula   cried the student      only two classes   went on the soldier  doggedly   ldquo and whoever isn t on one side is on the other      we wandered on up the street  where the lights were few and far between  and where people rarely passed  a threatening silence hung over the place as of a sort of purgatory between heaven and hell  a political no man s land  only the barber shops were all brilliantly lighted and crowded  and a line formed at the doors of the public bath  for it was saturday night  when all russia bathes and perfumes itself  i haven t the slightest doubt that soviet troops and cossacks mingled in the places where these ceremonies were performed   the nearer we came to the imperial park  the more deserted were the streets  a frightened priest pointed out the headquarters of the soviet  and hurried on  it was in the wing of one of the grand ducal palaces  fronting the park  the windows were dark  the door locked  a soldier  lounging about with his hands in the top of his trousers  looked us up and down with gloomy suspicion   the soviet went away two days ago   said he   where   a shrug    nie znayu   i don t know    a little further along was a large building  brightly illuminated  from within came a sound of hammering  while we were hesitating  a soldier and a sailor came down the street  hand in hand  i showed them my pass from smolny   are you for the soviets   i asked  they did not answer  but looked at each other in a frightened way    what is going on in there   asked the sailor  pointing to the building    i don t know    timidly the soldier put out his hand and opened the door a crack  inside a great hall hung with bunting and evergreens  rows of chairs  a stage being built   a stout woman with a hammer in her hand and her mouth full of tacks came out   what do you want   she asked    is there a performance to night   said the sailor  nervously    there will be private theatricals sunday night   she answered severely   go away    we tried to engage the soldier and sailor in conversation  but they seemed frightened and unhappy  and drew off into the darkness   we strolled toward the imperial palaces  along the edge of the vast  dark gardens  their fantastic pavilions and ornamental bridges looming uncertainly in the night  and soft water splashing from the fountains  at one place  where a ridiculous iron swan spat unceasingly from an artificial grotto  we were suddenly aware of observation  and looked up to encounter the sullen  suspicious gaze of half a dozen gigantic armed soldiers  who stared moodily down from a grassy terrace  i climbed up to them   who are you   i asked    we are the guard   answered one  they all looked very depressed  as undoubtedly they were  from weeks and weeks of all day all night argument and debate    are you kerensky s troops  or the soviets     there was silence for a moment  as they looked uneasily at each other  then   we are neutral   said he   we went on through the arch of the huge ekaterina palace  into the palace enclosure itself  asking for headquarters  a sentry outside a door in a curving white wing of the palace said that the commandant was inside   in a graceful  white  georgian room  divided into unequal parts by a two sided fire place  a group of officers stood anxiously talking  they were pale and distracted  and evidently hadn t slept  to one  an oldish man with a white beard  his uniform studded with decorations  who was pointed out as the colonel  we showed our bolshevik papers   he seemed surprised   how did you get here without being killed   he asked politely   it is very dangerous in the streets just now  political passion is running very high in tsarskoye selo  there was a battle this morning  and there will be another to morrow morning  kerensky is to enter the town at eight o clock     where are the cossacks     about a mile over that way   he waved his arm    and you will defend the city against them     oh dear no   he smiled   we are holding the city for kerensky   our hearts sank  for our passes stated that we were revolutionary to the core  the colonel cleared his throat   about those passes of yours   he went on   your lives will be in danger if you are captured  therefore  if you want to see the battle  i will give you an order for rooms in the officers  hotel  and if you will come back here at seven o clock in the morning  i will give you new passes     so you are for kerensky   we said    well  not exactly  for  kerensky   the colonel hesitated   you see  most of the soldiers in the garrison are bolsheviki  and to day  after the battle  they all went away in the direction of petrograd  taking the artillery with them  you might say that none of the  soldiers  are for kerensky  but some of them just don t want to fight at all  the  officers  have almost all gone over to kerensky s forces  or simply gone away  we are ahem in a most difficult position  as you see       we did not believe that there would be any battle     the colonel courteously sent his orderly to escort us to the railroad station  he was from the south  born of french immigrant parents in bessarabia   ah   he kept saying   it is not the danger or the hardships i mind  but being so long  three years  away from my mother       looking out of the window of the train as we sped through the cold dark toward petrograd  i caught glimpses of clumps of soldiers gesticulating in the light of fires  and of clusters of armoured cars halted together at cross roads  the chauffeurs hanging out of the turrets and shouting to each other      all the troubled night over the bleakflats leaderless bands of soldiers and red guards wandered  clashing and confused  and the commissars of the military revolutionary committee hurried from one group to another  trying to organise a defence      back in town excited throngs were moving in tides up and down the nevsky  something was in the air  from the warsaw railway station could be heard far off cannonade  in the  yunker  schools there was feverish activity  duma members went from barracks to barracks  arguing and pleading  narrating fearful stories of bolshevik violence massacre of the  yunkers  in the winter palace  rape of the women soldiers  the shooting of the girl before the duma  the murder of prince tumanov     in the alexander hall of the duma building the committee for salvation was in special session  commissars came and went  running     all the journalists expelled from smolny were there  in high spirits  they did not believe our report of conditions in tsarskoye  why  everybody knew that tsarskoye was in kerensky s hands  and that the cossacks were now at pulkovo  a committee was being elected to meet kerensky at the railway station in the morning      one confided to me  in strictest secrecy  that the counter revolution would begin at midnight  he showed me two proclamations  one signed by gotz and polkovnikov  ordering the  yunker  schools  soldier convalescents in the hospitals  and the knights of st  george to mobilise on a war footing and wait for orders from the committee for salvation  the other from the committee for salvation itself  which read as follows   to the population of petrograd   comrades  workers  soldiers and citizens of revolutionary petrograd   nary petrograd                 the bolsheviki  while appealing for peace at the front  are inciting to civil war in the rear   do not dig their provocatory appeals   do not dig trenches   down with the traitorous barricades   lay down your arms   soldiers  return to your barracks   the war begun in petrograd is the death of the revolution   in the name of liberty  land  and peace  unite around the committee for salvation of country and revolution   as we left the duma a company of red guards  stern faced and desperate  came marching down the dark  deserted street with a dozen prisoners members of the local branch of the council of cossacks  caught red handed plotting counter revolution in their headquarters      a soldier  accompanied by a small boy with a pail of paste  was sticking up great flaring notices   by virtue of the present  the city of petrograd and its suburbs are declared in a state of siege  all assemblies or meetings in the streets  and generally in the open air  are forbidden until further orders   n  podvoisky  president of the military  revolutionary committee   as we went home the air was full of confused sound automobile horns  shouts  distant shots  the city stirred uneasily  wakeful   in the small hours of the morning a company of  yunkers   disguised as soldiers of the semionovsky regiment  presented themselves at the telephone exchange just before the hour of changing guard  they had the bolshevik password  and took charge without arousing suspicion  a few minutes later antonov appeared  making a round of inspection  him they captured and locked in a small room  when the relief came it was met by a blast of rifle fire  several being killed   counter revolution had begun                                   chapter viii                              counter revolution  next morning  sunday the 11th  the cossacks entered tsarskoye selo  kerensky  see app  viii  sect  1  himself riding a white horse and all the church bells clamouring  from the top of a little hill outside the town could be seen the golden spires and many coloured cupolas  the sprawling grey immensity of the capital spread along the dreary plain  and beyond  the steely gulf of finland   there was no battle  but kerensky made a fatal blunder  at seven in the morning he sent word to the second tsarskoye selo rifles to lay down their arms  the soldiers replied that they would remain neutral  but would not disarm  kerensky gave them ten minutes in which to obey  this angered the soldiers  for eight months they had been governing themselves by committee  and this smacked of the old r gime     a few minutes later cossack artillery opened fire on the barracks  killing eight men  from that moment there were no more  neutral  soldiers in tsarskoye      petrograd woke to bursts of rifle fire  and the tramping thunder of men marching  under the high dark sky a cold wind smelt of snow  at dawn the military hotel and the telegraph agency had been taken by large forces of  yunkers   and bloodily recaptured  the telephone station was besieged by sailors  who lay behind barricades of barrels  boxes and tin sheets in the middle of the morskaya  or sheltered themselves at the corner of the gorokhovaya and of st  isaac s square  shooting at anything that moved  occasionally an automobile passed in and out  flying the red cross flag  the sailors let it pass      albert rhys williams was in the telephone exchange  he went out with the red cross automobile  which was ostensibly full of wounded  after circulating about the city  the car went by devious ways to the mikhailovsky  yunker  school  headquarters of the counter revolution  a french officer  in the court yard  seemed to be in command     by this means ammunition and supplies were conveyed to the telephone exchange  scores of these pretended ambulances acted as couriers and ammunition trains for the  yunkers    five or six armoured cars  belonging to the disbanded british armoured car division  were in their hands  as louise bryant was going along st  isaac s square one came rolling up from the admiralty  on its way to the telephone exchange  at the corner of the gogolia  right in front of her  the engine stalled  some sailors ambushed behind wood piles began shooting  the machine gun in the turret of the thing slewed around and spat a hail of bullets indiscriminately into the wood piles and the crowd  in the archway where miss bryant stood seven people were shot dead  among them two little boys  suddenly  with a shout  the sailors leaped up and rushed into the flaming open  closing around the monster  they thrust their bayonets into the loop holes  again and again  yelling    the chauffeur pretended to be wounded  and they let him go free to run to the duma and swell the tale of bolshevik atrocities    among the dead was a british officer      later the newspapers told of another french officer  captured in a  yunker  armoured car and sent to peter paul  the french embassy promptly denied this  but one of the city councillors told me that he himself had procured the officer s release from prison      whatever the official attitude of the allied embassies  individual french and british officers were active these days  even to the extent of giving advice at executive sessions of the committee for salvation   all day long in every quarter of the city there were skirmishes between  yunkers  and red guards  battles between armoured cars     volleys  single shots and the shrill chatter of machine guns could be heard  far and near  the iron shutters of the shops were drawn  but business still went on  even the moving picture shows  all outside lights dark  played to crowded houses  the street cars ran  the telephones were all working  when you called central  shooting could be plainly heard over the wire     smolny was cut off  but the duma and the committee for salvation were in constant communication with all the  yunker  schools and with kerensky at tsarskoye   at seven in the morning the vladimir  yunker  school was visited by a patrol of soldiers  sailors and red guards  who gave the  yunkers  twenty minutes to lay down their arms  the ultimatum was rejected  an hour later the  yunkers  got ready to march  but were driven back by a violent fusillade from the corner of the grebetskaya and the bolshoy prospekt  soviet troops surrounded the building and opened fire  two armoured cars cruising back and forth with machine guns raking it  the  yunkers  telephoned for help  the cossacks replied that they dare not come  because a large body of sailors with two cannon commanded their barracks  the pavlovsk school was surrounded  most of the mikhailov  yunkers  were fighting in the streets      at half past eleven three field pieces arrived  another demand to surrender was met by the  yunkers  shooting down two of the soviet delegates under the white flag  now began a real bombardment  great holes were torn in the walls of the school  the  yunkers  defended themselves desperately  shouting waves of red guards  assaulting  crumpled under the withering blast     kerensky telephoned from tsarskoye to refuse all parley with the military revolutionary committee   frenzied by defeat and their heaps of dead  the soviet troops opened a tornado of steel and flame against the battered building  their own officers could not stop the terrible bombardment  a commissar from smolny named kirilov tried to halt it  he was threatened with lynching  the red guards  blood was up   at half past two the  yunkers  hoisted a white flag  they would surrender if they were guaranteed protection  this was promised  with a rush and a shout thousands of soldiers and red guards poured through windows  doors and holes in the wall  before it could be stopped five  yunkers  were beaten and stabbed to death  the rest  about two hundred  were taken to peter paul under escort  in small groups so as to avoid notice  on the way a mob set upon one party  killing eight more  yunkers      more than a hundred red guards and soldiers had fallen      two hours later the duma got a telephone message that the victors were marching toward the  injinierny zamok  the engineers  school  a dozen members immediately set out to distribute among them armfuls of the latest proclamation of the committee for salvation  several did not come back     all the other schools surrendered without resistance  and the  yunkers  were sent unharmed to peter paul and cronstadt      the telephone exchange held out until afternoon  when a bolshevik armoured car appeared  and the sailors stormed the place  shrieking  the frightened telephone girls ran to and fro  the  yunkers  tore from their uniforms all distinguishing marks  and one offered williams  anything  for the loan of his overcoat  as a disguise      they will massacre us  they will massacre us   they cried  for many of them had given their word at the winter palace not to take up arms against the people  williams offered to mediate if antonov were released  this was immediately done  antonov and williams made speeches to the victorious sailors  inflamed by their many dead and once more the  yunkers  went free     all but a few  who in their panic tried to flee over the roofs  or to hide in the attic  and were found and hurled into the street   tired  bloody  triumphant  the sailors and workers swarmed into the switchboard room  and finding so many pretty girls  fell back in an embarrassed way and fumbled with awkward feet  not a girl was injured  not one insulted  frightened  they huddled in the corners  and then  finding themselves safe  gave vent to their spite   ugh  the dirty  ignorant people  the fools      the sailors and red guards were embarrassed   brutes  pigs   shrilled the girls  indignantly putting on their coats and hats  romantic had been their experience passing up cartridges and dressing the wounds of their dashing young defenders  the  yunkers   many of them members of noble families  fighting to restore their beloved tsar  these were just common workmen  peasants   dark people       the commissar of the military revolutionary committee  little vishniak  tried to persuade the girls to remain  he was effusively polite   you have been badly treated   he said   the telephone system is controlled by the municipal duma  you are paid sixty rubles a month  and have to work ten hours and more     from now on all that will be changed  the government intends to put the telephones under control of the ministry of posts and telegraphs  your wages will be immediately raised to one hundred and fifty rubles  and your working hours reduced  as members of the working class you should be happy     members of the  working class  indeed  did he mean to infer that there was anything in common between these these animals and  us   remain  not if they offered a thousand rubles     haughty and spiteful the girls left the place      the employees of the building  the line men and labourers they stayed  but the switch boards must be operated the telephone was vital     only half a dozen trained operators were available  volunteers were called for  a hundred responded  sailors  soldiers  workers  the six girls scurried backward and forward  instructing  helping  scolding     so  crippled  halting  but  going   the wires slowly began to hum  the first thing was to connect smolny with the barracks and the factories  the second  to cut off the duma and the  yunker  schools     late in the afternoon word of it spread through the city  and hundreds of bourgeois called up to scream   fools  devils  how long do you think you will last  wait till the cossacks come    dusk was already falling  on the almost deserted nevsky  swept by a bitter wind  a crowd had gathered before the kazan cathedral  continuing the endless debate  a few workmen  some soldiers and the rest shop keepers  clerks and the like    but lenin won t get germany to make peace   cried one   a violent young soldier replied   and whose fault is it  your damn kerensky  dirty bourgeois  to hell with kerensky  we don t want him  we want lenin       outside the duma an officer with a white arm band was tearing down posters from the wall  swearing loudly  one read   to the population of petrograd   at this dangerous hour  when the municipal duma ought to use every means to calm the population  to assure it bread and other necessities  the right socialist revolutionaries and the cadets  forgetting their duty  have turned the duma into a counter revolutionary meeting  trying to raise part of the population against the rest  so as to facilitate the victory of kornilov kerensky  instead of doing their duty  the right socialist revolutionaries and the cadets have transformed the duma into an arena of political attack upon the soviets of workers   soldiers  and peasants  deputies  against the revolutionary government of peace  bread and liberty   citizens of petrograd  we  the bolshevik municipal councillors elected by you we want you to know that the right socialist revolutionaries and the cadets are engaged in counter revolutionary action  have forgotten their duty  and are leading the population to famine  to civil war  we  elected by 183 000 votes  consider it our duty to bring to the attention of our constituents what is going on in the duma  and declare that we disclaim all responsibility for the terrible but inevitable consequences      far away still sounded occasional shots  but the city lay quiet  cold  as if exhausted by the violent spasms which had torn it   in the nicolai hall the duma session was coming to an end  even the truculent duma seemed a little stunned  one after another the commissars reported capture of the telephone exchange  street fighting  the taking of the vladimir school      the duma   said trupp   is on the side of the democracy in its struggle against arbitrary violence  but in any case  whichever side wins  the duma will always be against lynchings and torture       konovski  cadet  a tall old man with a cruel face   when the troops of the legal government arrive in petrograd  they will shoot down these insurgents  and that will not be lynching   protests all over the hall  even from his own party   here there was doubt and depression  the counter revolution was being put down  the central committee of the socialist revolutionary party had voted lack of confidence in its officers  the left wing was in control  avksentiev had resigned  signed  a courier reported that the committee of welcome sent to meet kerensky at the railway station had been arrested  in the streets could be heard the dull rumble of distant cannonading  south and southwest  still kerensky did not come     only three newspapers were out  pravda  dielo naroda  and  novaya zhizn   all of them devoted much space to the new  coalition  government  the socialist revolutionary paper demanded a cabinet without either cadets or bolsheviki  gorky was hopeful  smolny had made concessions  a purely socialist government was taking shape all elements except the bourgeoisie  as for  pravda   it sneered   we ridicule these coalitions with political parties whose most prominent members are petty journalists of doubtful reputation  our  coalition  is that of the proletariat and the revolutionary army with the poor peasants     on the walls a vainglorious announcement of the  vikzhel   threatening to strike if both sides did not compromise   the conquerors of these riots  the saviours of the wreck of our country  these will be neither the bolsheviki  nor the committee for salvation  nor the troops of kerensky but we  the union of railwaymen     red guards are incapable of handling a complicated business like the railways  as for the provisional government  it has shown itself incapable of holding the power     we refuse to lend our services to any party which does not act by authority of     a government based on the confidence of all the democracy      smolny thrilled with the boundless vitality of inexhaustible humanity in action   in trade union headquarters lozovsky introduced me to a delegate of the railway workers of the nicolai line  who said that the men were holding huge mass meetings  condemning the action of their leaders    all power to the soviets   he cried  pounding on the table   the oborontsi  in the central committee are playing ko rgrave nilov s game  they tried to send a mission to the stavka  but we arrested them at minsk     our branch has demanded an all russian convention  and they refuse to call it       the same situation as in the soviets  the army committees  one after another the various democratic organisations  all over russia  were cracking and changing  the cooperatives were torn by internal struggles  the meetings of the peasants  executive broke up in stormy wrangling  even among the cossacks there was trouble      on the top floor the military revolutionary committee was in full blast  striking and slacking not  men went in  fresh and vigorous  night and day and night and day they threw themselves into the terrible machine  and came out limp  blind with fatigue  hoarse and filthy  to fall on the floor and sleep     the committee for salvation had been outlawed  great piles of new proclamations  see app  viii  sect  2  littered the floor       the conspirators  who have no support among the garrison or the working class  above all counted on the suddenness of their attack  their plan was discovered in time by sub lieutenant blagonravov  thanks to the revolutionary vigilance of a soldier of the red guard  whose name shall be made public  at the centre of the plot was the committee for salvation  colonel polkovnikov was in command of their forces  and the orders were signed by gotz  former member of the provisional government  allowed at liberty on his word of honour      bringing these facts to the attention of the petrograd population  the military revolutionary committee orders the arrest of all concerned in the conspiracy  who shall be tried before the revolutionary tribunal      from moscow  word that the  yunkers  and cossacks had surrounded the kremlin and ordered the soviet troops to lay down their arms  the soviet forces complied  and as they were leaving the kremlin  were set upon and shot down  small forces of bolsheviki had been driven from the telephone and telegraph offices  the  yunkers  now held the centre of the city      but all around them the soviet troops were mustering  street fighting was slowly gathering way  all attempts at compromise had failed     on the side of the soviet  ten thousand garrison soldiers and a few red guards  on the side of the government  six thousand  yunkers   twenty five hundred cossacks and two thousand white guards   the petrograd soviet was meeting  and next door the new  tsay ee kah   acting on the decrees and orders  see app  viii  sect  3  which came down in a steady stream from the council of people s commissars in session upstairs  on the order in which laws are to be ratified and published  establishing an eight hour days for workers  and lunatcharsky s  basis for a system of popular education   only a few hundred people were present at the two meetings  most of them armed  smolny was almost deserted  except for the guards  who were busy at the hall windows  setting up machine guns to command the flanks of the building   in the  tsay ee kah  a delegate of the  vikzhel  was speaking   we refuse to transport the troops of either party     we have sent a committee to kerensky to say that if he continues to march on petrograd we will break his lines of communication       he made the usual plea for a conference of all the socialist parties to form a new government      kameniev answered discreetly  the bolsheviki would be very glad to attend the conference  the centre of gravity  however  lay not in composition of such a government  but in its acceptance of the programme of the congress of soviets       the  tsay ee kah  had deliberated on the declaration made by the left socialist revolutionaries and the social democrats internationalists  and had accepted the proposition of proportional representation at the conference  even including delegates from the army committees and the peasants  soviets      in the great hall  trotzky recounted the events of the day    we offered the vladimir  yunkers  a chance to surrender   he said   we wanted to settle matters without bloodshed  but now that blood has been spilled there is only one way pitiless struggle  it would be childish to think we can win by any other means     the moment is decisive  everybody must cooperate with the military revolutionary committee  report where there are stores of barbed wire  benzine  guns       we ve won the power  now we must keep it    the menshevik yoffe tried to read his party s declaration  but trotzky refused to allow  a debate about principle     our debates are now in the streets   he cried   the decisive step has been taken  we all  and i in particular  take the responsibility for what is happening       soldiers from the front  from gatchina  told their stories  one from the death battalion  four hundred eighty first artillery   when the trenches hear of this  they will cry   this is  our  government    a  yunker  from peterhof said that he and two others had refused to march against the soviets  and when his comrades had returned from the defence of the winter palace they appointed him their commissar  to go to smolny and offer their services to the  real  revolution      then trotzky again  fiery  indefatigable  giving orders  answering questions    the petty bourgeoisie  in order to defeat the workers  soldiers and peasants  would combine with the devil himself   he said once  many cases of drunkenness had been remarked the last two days   no drinking  comrades  no one must be on the streets after eight in the evening  except the regular guards  all places suspected of having stores of liquor should be searched  and the liquor destroyed   see app  viii  sect  4  no mercy to the sellers of liquor       the military revolutionary committee sent for the delegation from the viborg section  then for the members from putilov  they clumped out hurriedly    for each revolutionist killed   said trotzky   we shall kill five counter revolutionists    down town again  the duma brilliantly illuminated and great crowds pouring in  in the lower hall wailing and cries of grief  the throng surged back and forth before the bulletin board  where was posted a list of  yunkers  killed in the day s fighting or supposed to be killed  for most of the dead afterward turned up safe and sound     up in the alexander hall the committee for salvation held forth  the gold and red epaulettes of officers were conspicuous  the familiar faces of the menshevik and socialist revolutionary intellectuals  the hard eyes and bulky magnificence of bankers and diplomats  officials of the old r gime  and well dressed women      the telephone girls were testifying  girl after girl came to the tribune over dressed  fashion aping little girls  with pinched faces and leaky shoes  girl after girl  flushing with pleasure at the applause of the  nice  people of petrograd  of the officers  the rich  the great names of politics girl after girl  to narrate her sufferings at the hands of the proletariat  and proclaim her loyalty to all that was old  established and powerful      the duma was again in session in the nicolai hall  the mayor said hopefully that the petrograd regiments were ashamed of their actions  propaganda was making headway    graphic page 205 proclamation for  wine pogroms     revolutionary law and order  a proclamation of the finland regiment  in december  1917  announcing desperate remedies for  wine pogroms   for translation see appendix 5       emissaries came and went  reporting horrible deeds by the bolsheviki  interceding to save the  yunkers   busily investigating       the bolsheviki   said trupp   will be conquered by moral force  and not by bayonets        meanwhile all was not well on the revolutionary front  the enemy had brought up armoured trains  mounted with cannon  the soviet forces  mostly raw red guards  were without officers and without a definite plan  only five thousand regular soldiers had joined them  the rest of the garrison was either busy suppressing the  yunker  revolt  guarding the city  or undecided what to do  at ten in the evening lenin addressed a meeting of delegates from the city regiments  who voted overwhelmingly to fight  a committee of five soldiers was elected to serve as general staff  and in the small hours of the morning the regiments left their barracks in full battle array     going home i saw them pass  swinging along with the regular tread of veterans  bayonets in perfect alignment  through the deserted streets of the conquered city      at the same time  in the headquarters of the  vikzhel  down on the sadovaya  the conference of all the socialist parties to form a new government was under way  abramovitch  for the centre mensheviki  said that there should be neither conquerors nor conquered that bygones should be bygones     in this were agreed all the left wing parties  dan  speaking in the name of the right mensheviki  proposed to the bolsheviki the following conditions for a truce  the red guard to be disarmed  and the petrograd garrison to be placed at the orders of the duma  the troops of kerensky not to fire a single shot or arrest a single man  a ministry of all the socialist parties  except the bolsheviki   for smolny riazanov and kameniev declared that a coalition ministry of all parties was acceptable  but protested at dan s proposals  the socialist revolutionaries were divided  but the executive committee of the peasants s soviets and the populist socialists flatly refused to admit the bolsheviki     after bitter quarrelling a commission was elected to draw up a workable plan      all that night the commission wrangled  and all the next day  and the next night  once before  on the 9th of november  there had been a similar effort at conciliation  led by martov and gorky  but at the approach of kerensky and the activity of the committee for salvation  the right wing of the mensheviki  socialist revolutionaries and populist socialists suddenly withdrew  now they were awed by the crushing of the  yunker  rebellion     monday the 12th was a day of suspense  the eyes of all russia were fixed on the grey plain beyond the gates of petrograd  where all the available strength of the old order faced the unorganised power of the new  the unknown  in moscow a truce had been declared  both sides parleyed  awaiting the result in the capital  now the delegates to the congress of soviets  hurrying on speeding trains to the farthest reaches of asia  were coming to their homes  carrying the fiery cross  in wide spreading ripples news of the miracle spread over the face of the land  and in its wake towns  cities and far villages stirred and broke  soviets and military revolutionary committees against dumas  zemstvos and government commissars red guards against white street fighting and passionate speech     the result waited on the word from petrograd      smolny was almost empty  but the duma was thronged and noisy  the old mayor  in his dignified way  was protesting against the appeal of the bolshevik councillors    the duma is not a centre of counter revolution   he said  warmly   the duma takes no part in the present struggle between the parties  but at a time when there is no legal power in the land  the only centre of order is the municipal self government  the peaceful population recognises this fact  the foreign embassies recognise only such documents as are signed by the mayor of the town  the mind of a european does not admit of any other situation  as the municipal self government is the only organ which is capable of protecting the interests of the citizens  the city is bound to show hospitality  to all organisations which desire to profit by such hospitality  and therefore the duma cannot prevent the distribution of any newspapers whatever within the duma building  the sphere of our work is increasing  and we must be given full liberty of action  and our rights must be respected by both parties       we are perfectly neutral  when the telephone exchange was occupied by the  yunkers  colonel polkovnikov ordered the telephones to smolny disconnected  but i protested  and the telephones were kept going       at this there was ironic laughter from the bolshevik benches  and imprecations from the right    and yet   went on schreider   they look upon us as counter revolutionaries and report us to the population  they deprive us of our means of transport by taking away our last motor cars  it will not be our fault if there is famine in the town  protests are of no use       kobozev  bolshevik member of the town board  was doubtful whether the military revolutionary committee had requisitioned the municipal automobiles  even granting the fact  it was probably done by some unauthorised individual  in the emergency    the mayor   he continued   tells us that we must not make political meetings out of the duma  but every menshevik and socialist revolutionary here talks nothing but party propaganda  and at the door they distribute their illegal newspapers   iskri   sparks    soldatski golos  and  rabotchaya gazeta   inciting to insurrection  what if we bolsheviki should also begin to distribute our papers here  but this shall not be  for we respect the duma  we have not attacked the municipal self government  and we shall not do so  but you have addressed an appeal to the population  and we are entitled also to do so      followed him shingariov  cadet  who said that there could be no common language with those who were liable to be brought before the attorney general for indictment  and who must be tried on the charge of treason     he proposed again that all bolshevik members should be expelled from the duma  this was tabled  however  for there were no personal charges against the members  and they were active in the municipal administration   then two mensheviki internationalists  declaring that the appeal of the bolshevik councillors was a direct incitement to massacre   if everything that is against the bolsheviki is counter revolutionary   said pinkevitch   then i do not know the difference between revolution and anarchy     the bolsheviki are depending upon the passions of the unbridled masses  we have nothing but moral force  we will protest against massacres and violence from both sides  as our task is to find a peaceful issue     the notice posted in the streets under the heading  to the pillory   which calls upon the people to destroy the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries   said nazariev   is a crime which you  bolsheviki  will not be able to wash away  yesterday s horrors are but a preface to what you are preparing by such a proclamation     i have always tried to reconcile you with the other parties  but at present i feel for you nothing but contempt    the bolshevik councillors were on their feet  shouting angrily  assailed by hoarse  hateful voices and waving arms      outside the hall i ran into the city engineer  the menshevik gomberg and three or four reporters  they were all in high spirits    see   they said   the cowards are afraid of us  they don t dare arrest the duma  their military revolutionary committee doesn t dare to send a commissar into this building  why  on the corner of the sadovaya to day  i saw a red guard try to stop a boy selling  soldatski golos      the boy just laughed at him  and a crowd of people wanted to lynch the bandit  it s only a few hours more  now  even if kerensky wouldn t come they haven t the men to run a government  absurd  i understand they re even fighting among themselves at smolny    a socialist revolutionary friend of mine drew me aside   i know where the committee for salvation is hiding   he said   do you want to go and talk with them    by this time it was dusk  the city had again settled down to normal shop shutters up  lights shining  and on the streets great crowds of people slowly moving up and down and arguing      at number 86 nevsky we went through a passage into a courtyard  surrounded by tall apartment buildings  at the door of apartment 229 my friend knocked in a peculiar way  there was a sound of scuffling  an inside door slammed  then the front door opened a crack and a woman s face appeared  after a minute s observation she led us in a placid looking  middle aged lady who at once cried   kyril  it s all right   in the dining room  where a samovar steamed on the table and there were plates full of bread and raw fish  a man in uniform emerged from behind the window curtains  and another  dressed like a workman  from a closet  they were delighted to meet an american reporter  with a certain amount of gusto both said that they would certainly be shot if the bolsheviki caught them  they would not give me their names  but both were socialist revolutionaries       why   i asked   do you publish such lies in your newspapers    without taking offence the officer replied   yes  i know  but what can we do   he shrugged   you must admit that it is necessary for us to create a certain frame of mind in the people       the other man interrupted   this is merely an adventure on the part of the bolsheviki  they have no intellectuals      the ministries won t work     russia is not a city  but a whole country     realising that they can only last a few days  we have decided to come to the aid of the strongest force opposed to them kerensky and help to restore order     that is all very well   i said   but why do you combine with the cadets    the pseudo workman smiled frankly   to tell you the truth  at this moment the masses of the people are following the bolsheviki  we have no following now  we can t mobilise a handful of soldiers  there are no arms available     the bolsheviki are right to a certain extent  there are at this moment in russia only two parties with any force the bolsheviki and the reactionaries  who are all hiding under the coat tails of the cadets  the cadets think they are using us  but it is really we who are using the cadets  when we smash the bolsheviki we shall turn against the cadets        will the bolsheviki be admitted into the new government    he scratched his head   that s a problem   he admitted   of course if they are not admitted  they sll probably do this all over again  at any rate  they will have a chance to hold the balance of power in the constituent that is  if there  is  a constituent     and then  too   said the officer   that brings up the question of admitting the cadets into the new government and for the same reasons  you know the cadets do not really want the constituent assembly not if the bolsheviki can be destroyed now   he shook his head   it is not easy for us russians  politics  you americans are born politicians  you have had politics all your lives  but for us well  it has only been a year  you know     what do you think of kerensky   i asked    oh  kerensky is guilty of the sins of the provisional government   answered the other man   kerensky himself forced us to accept coalition with the bourgeoisie  if he had resigned  as he threatened  it would have meant a new cabinet crisis only sixteen weeks before the constituent assembly  and that we wanted to avoid     but didn t it amount to that anyway     yes  but how were we to know  they tricked us the kerenskys and avksentievs  gotz is a little more radical  i stand with tchernov  who is a real revolutionist     why  only to day lenin sent word that he would not object to tchernov entering the government    we wanted to get rid of the kerensky government too  but we thought it better to wait for the constituent     at the beginning of this affair i was with the bolsheviki  but the central committee of my party voted unanimously against it and what could i do  it was a matter of party discipline       in a week the bolshevik government will go to pieces  if the socialist revolutionaries could only stand aside and wait  the government would fall into their hands  but if we wait a week the country will be so disorganised that the german imperialists will be victorious  that is why we began our revolt with only two regiments of soldiers promising to support us and they turned against us     that left only the  yunkers         how about the cossacks    the officer sighed   they did not move  at first they said they would come out if they had infantry support  they said moreover that they had their men with kerensky  and that they were doing their part     then  too  they said that the cossacks were always accused of being the hereditary enemies of democracy     and finally   the bolsheviki promise that they will not take away our land  there is no danger to us  we remain neutral     during this talk people were constantly entering and leaving most of them officers  their shoulder straps torn off  we could see them in the hall  and hear their low  vehement voices  occasionally  through the half drawn porti res  we caught a glimpse of a door opening into a bath room  where a heavily built officer in a colonel s uniform sat on the toilet  writing something on a pad held in his lap  i recognised colonel polkovnikov  former commandant of petrograd  for whose arrest the military revolutionary committee would have paid a fortune    our programme   said the officer   this is it  land to be turned over to the land committees  workmen to have full representation in the control of industry  an energetic peace programme  but not an ultimatum to the world such as the bolsheviki issued  the bolsheviki cannot keep their promises to the masses  even in the country itself  we won t let them     they stole our land programme in order to get the support of the peasants  that is dishonest  if they had waited for the constituent assembly     it doesn t matter about the constituent assembly   broke in the officer   if the bolsheviki want to establish a socialist state here  we cannot work with them in any event  kerensky made the great mistake  he let the bolsheviki know what he was going to do by announcing in the council of the republic that he had ordered their arrest       but what   i said   do you intend to do now    the two men looked at one another   you will see in a few days  if there are enough troops from the front on our side  we shall not compromise with the bolsheviki  if not  perhaps we shall be forced to       out again on the nevsky we swung on the step of a streetcar bulging with people  its platforms bent down from the weight and scraping along the ground  which crawled with agonising slowness the long miles to smolny   meshkovsky  a neat  frail little man  was coming down the hall  looking worried  the strikes in the ministries  he told us  were having their effect  for instance  the council of people s commissars had promised to publish the secret treaties  but neratov  the functionary in charge  had disappeared  taking the documents with him  they were supposed to be hidden in the british embassy      worst of all  however  was the strike in the banks   without money   said menzhinsky   we are helpless  the wages of the railroad men  of the postal and telegraph employees  must be paid     the banks are closed  and the key to the situation  the state bank  is also shut  all the bank clerks in russia have been bribed to stop work       but lenin has issued an order to dynamite the state bank vaults  and there is a decree just out  ordering the private banks to open to morrow  or we will open them ourselves    the petrograd soviet was in full swing  thronged with armed men  trotzky reporting    the cossacks are falling back from krasnoye selo    sharp  exultant cheering    but the battle is only beginning  at pulkovo heavy fighting is going on  all available forces must be hurried there       from moscow  bad news  the kremlin is in the hands of the  yunkers   and the workers have only a few arms  the result depends upon petrograd    at the front  the decrees on peace and land are provoking great enthusiasm  kerensky is flooding the trenches with tales of petrograd burning and bloody  of women and children massacred by the bolsheviki  but no one believes him       the cruisers  oleg  avrora  and  respublica  are anchored in the neva  their guns trained on the approaches to the city        why aren t you out there with the red guards   shouted a rough voice    i m going now   answered trotzky  and left the platform  his face a little paler than usual  he passed down the side of the room          e room                       surrounded by eager friends  and hurried out to the waiting automobile   kameniev now spoke  describing the proceedings of the reconciliation conference  the armistice conditions proposed by the mensheviki  he said  had been contemptuously rejected  even the branches of the railwaymen s union had voted against such a proposition       now that we ve won the power and are sweeping all russia   he declared   all they ask of us are three little things  1  to surrender the power  2  to make the soldiers continue the war  3  to make the peasants forget about the land       lenin appeared for a moment  to answer the accusations of the socialist revolutionaries    they charge us with stealing their land programme     if that is so  we bow to them  it is good enough for us       so the meeting roared on  leader after leader explaining  exhorting  arguing  soldier after soldier  workman after workman  standing up to speak his mind and his heart     the audience flowed  changing and renewed continually  from time to time men came in  yelling for the members of such and such a detachment  to go to the front  others  relieved  wounded  or coming to smolny for arms and equipment  poured in      it was almost three o clock in the morning when  as we left the hall  holtzman  of the military revolutionary committee  came running down the hall with a transfigured face    it s all right   he shouted  grabbing my hands   telegram from the front  kerensky is smashed  look at this    he held out a sheet of paper  scribbled hurriedly in pencil  and then  seeing we couldn t read it  he declaimed aloud   pulkovo  staff  2 10 a m   the night of october 30th to 31st will go down in history  the attempt of kerensky to move counter revolutionary troops against the capital of the revolution has been decisively repulsed  kerensky is retreating  we are advancing  the soldiers  sailors and workers of petrograd have shown that they can and will with arms in their hands enforce the will and authority of the democracy  the bourgeoisie tried to isolate the revolutionary army  kerensky attempted to break it by the force of the cossacks  both plans met a pitiful defeat   the grand idea of the domination of the worker and peasant democracy closed the ranks of the army and hardened its will  all the country from now on will be convinced that the power of the soviets is no ephemeral thing  but an invincible fact     the repulse of kerensky is the repulse of the land owners  the bourgeoisie and the kornilovists in general  the repulse of kerensky is the confirmation of the right of the people to a peaceful free life  to land  bread and power  the pulkovo detachment by its valorous blow has strengthened the cause of the workers  and peasants s revolution  there is no return to the past  before us are struggles  obstacles and sacrifices  but the road is clear and victory is certain   revolutionary russia and the soviet power can be proud of their pulkovo detachment  acting under the command of colonel walden  eternal memory to those who fell  glory to the warriors of the revolution  the soldiers and the officers who were faithful to the people   long live revolutionary  popular  socialist russia   in the name of the council   l  trotzky  people s commissar      driving home across znamensky square  we made out an unusual crowd in front of the nicolai railway station  several thousand sailors were massed there  bristling with rifles   standing on the steps  a member of the  vikzhel  was pleading with them    comrades  we cannot carry you to moscow  we are neutral  we do not carry troops for either side  we cannot take you to moscow  where already there is terrible civil war       all the seething square roared at him  the sailors began to surge forward  suddenly another door was flung wide  in it stood two or three brakeman  a fireman or so    this way  comrades   cried one   we will take you to moscow or vladivostok  if you like  long live the revolution                                  chapter ix                                 victory   order number i   to the troops of the pulkovo detachment   november 13  1917  38 minutes past 9 a  m   after a cruel fight the troops of the pulkovo detachment completely routed the counter revolutionary forces  who retreated from their positions in disorder  and under cover of tsarskoye selo fell back toward pavlovsk ii and gatchina   our advanced units occupied the northeastern extremity of tsarskoye selo and the station alexandrovskaya  the colpinno detachment was on our left  the krasnoye selo detachment to our right   i ordered the pulkovo forces to occupy tsarskoye selo  to fortify its approaches  especially on the side of gatchina   also to pass and occupy pavlovskoye  fortifying its southern side  and to take up the railroad as far as dno   the troops must take all measures to strengthen the positions occupied by them  arranging trenches and other defensive works   they must enter into close liaison with the detachments of colpinno and krasnoye selo  and also with the staff of the commander in chief for the defence of petrograd   signed    commander in chief aver all forces acting against the counter revolutionary troops of kerensky    lieutenant colonel muraviov   tuesday morning  but how is this  only two days ago the petrograd campagna was full of leaderless bands  wandering aimlessly  without food  without artillery  without a plan  what had fused that disorganised mass of undisciplined red guards  and soldiers without officers  into an army obedient to its own elected high command  tempered to meet and break the assault of cannon and cossack cavalry   see app  ix  sect  1   people in revolt have a way of defying military precedent  the ragged armies of the french revolution are not forgotten valmy and the lines of weissembourg  massed against the soviet forces were  yunkers   cossacks  land owners  nobility  black hundreds the tsar come again   okhrana  and siberian chains  and the vast and terrible menace of the germans     victory  in the words of carlyle  meant  apotheosis and millennium without end    sunday night  the commissars of the military revolutionary committee returning desperately from the field  the garrison of petrograd elected its committee of five  its battle staff  three soldiers and two officers  all certified free from counter revolutionary taint  colonel muraviov  ex patriot  was in command an efficient man  but to be carefully watched  at colpinno  at obukhovo  at pulkovo and krasnoye selo were formed provisional detachments  increased in size as the stragglers came in from the surrounding country mixed soldiers  sailors and red guards  parts of regiments  infantry  cavalry and artillery all together  and a few armoured cars   day broke  and the pickets of kerensky s cossacks came in touch  scattered rifle fire  summons to surrender  over the bleak plain on the cold quiet air spread the sound of battle  falling upon the ears of roving bands as they gathered about their little fires  waiting     so it was beginning  they made toward the battle  and the worker hordes pouring out along the straight roads quickened their pace     thus upon all the points of attack automatically converged angry human swarms  to be met by commissars and assigned positions  or work to do  this was  their  battle  for  their  world  the officers in command were elected by  them   for the moment that incoherent multiple will was one will      those who participated in the fighting described to me how the sailors fought until they ran out of cartridges  and then stormed  how the untrained workmen rushed the charging cossacks and tore them from their horses  how the anonymous hordes of the people  gathering in the darkness around the battle  rose like a tide and poured over the enemy     before midnight of monday the cossacks broke and were fleeing  leaving their artillery behind them  and the army of the proletariat  on a long ragged front  moved forward and rolled into tsarskoye  before the enemy had a chance to destroy the great government wireless station  from which now the commissars of smolny were hurling out to the world paeans of triumph      to all soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies  the 12th of november  in a bloody combat near tsarskoye selo  the revolutionary army defeated the counter revolutionary troops of kerensky and kornilov  in the name of the revolutionary government i order all regiments to take the offensive against the enemies of the revolutionary democracy  and to take all measures to arrest kerensky  and also to oppose any adventure which might menace the conquests of the revolution and the victory of the proletariat   long live the revolutionary army  muraviov   news from the provinces      at sevastopol the local

soviet was in control  from kazan came reports of a battle in the streets   yunkers  and a brigade of artillery against the bolshevik garrison      desperate fighting had broken out again in moscow  the  yunkers  and white guards held the kremlin and the centre of the town  beaten upon from all sides by the troops of the military revolutionary committee  the soviet artillery was stationed in skobeliev square  bombarding the city duma building  the prefecture and the hotel metropole  the cobblestones of the tverskaya and nikitskaya had been torn up for trenches and barricades  a hail of machine gun fire swept the quarters of the great banks and commercial houses  there were no lights  no telephones  the bourgeois population lived in the cellars     the last bulletin said that the military revolutionary committee had delivered an ultimatum to the committee of public safety  demanding the immediate surrender of the kremlin  or bombardment would follow    bombard the kremlin   cried the ordinary citizen   they dare not    from vologda to chita in far siberia  from pskov to sevastopol on the black sea  in great cities and little villages  civil war burst into flame  from thousands of factories  peasant communes  regiments and armies  ships on the wide sea  greetings poured into petrograd greetings to the government of the people   the cossack government at novotcherkask telegraphed to kerensky    the government of the cossack troops invites the provisional government and the members of the council of the republic to come  if possible  to novotcherkask  where we can organise in common the struggle against the bolsheviki     in finland  also  things were stirring  the soviet of helsingfors and the  tsentrobalt   central committee of the baltic fleet   jointly proclaimed a state of siege  and declared that all attempts to interfere with the bolshevik forces  and all armed resistance to its orders  would be severely repressed  at the same time the finnish railway union called a countrywide general strike  to put into operation the laws passed by the socialist diet of june  1917  dissolved by kerensky      early in the morning i went out to smolny  going up the long wooden sidewalk from the outer gate i saw the first thin  hesitating snow flakes fluttering down from the grey  windless sky   snow   cried the soldier at the door  grinning with delight   good for the health   inside  the long  gloomy halls and bleak rooms seemed deserted  no one moved in all the enormous pile  a deep  uneasy sound came to my ears  and looking around  i noticed that everywhere on the floor  along the walls  men were sleeping  rough  dirty men  workers and soldiers  spattered and caked with mud  sprawled alone or in heaps  in the careless attitudes of death  some wore ragged bandages marked with blood  guns and cartridge belts were scattered about     the victorious proletarian army   in the upstairs buffet so thick they lay that one could hardly walk  the air was foul  through the clouded windows a pale light streamed  a battered samovar  cold  stood on the counter  and many glasses holding dregs of tea  beside them lay a copy of the military revolutionary committee s last bulletin  upside down  scrawled with painful hand writing  it was a memorial written by some soldier to his comrades fallen in the fight against kerensky  just as he had set it down before falling on the floor to sleep  the writing was blurred with what looked like tears      alexei vinogradov  d  maskvin  s  stolbikov  a  voskressensky  d  leonsky  d  preobrazhensky

military revolutionary committee still functioned  unsleeping  skripnik  emerging from the inner room  said that gotz had been arrested  but had flatly denied signing the proclamation of the committee for salvation  as had avksentiev  and the committee for salvation itself had repudiated the appeal to the garrison  there was still disafiection among the city regiments  skripnik reported  the volhynsky regiment had refused to fight against kerensky   several detachments of  neutral  troops  with tchernov at their head  were at gatchina  trying to persuade kerensky to halt his attack on petrograd   skripnik laughed   there can be no  neutrals  now   he said   we ve won   his sharp  bearded face glowed with an almost religious exaltation   more than sixty delegates have arrived from the front  with assurances of support by all the armies except the troops on the rumanian front  who have not been heard from  the army committees have suppressed all news from petrograd  but we now have a regular system of couriers        graphic page 224 certificate approving telegram transmission  order given me at staff headquarters by command of the council of people s commissars  to

herewith  has been examined by the government of people s commissars  and there is no objection to its transmission  and also it is recommended that all cooperate in every way to transmit same to its

all night session of the conference to form a new government  but happy   already the socialist revolutionaries are inclined to admit us into the new government   he told me   the right wing groups are frightened by the revolutionary tribunals  they demand  in a sort of panic  that we dissolve them before going any further      we have accepted the proposition of the  vikzhel  to form a homogeneous socialist ministry  and they re working on that now  you see  it all springs from our victory  when we were down  they would t have us at any price  not everybody s in favour of some agreement with the soivets     what we need is a really decisive victory  kerensky wants an armistice  but he ll have to surrender  see app  ix  sect  2         that was the temper of the bolshevik leaders  to a foreign journalist who asked trotzky what statement he had to make to the world  trotzky replied   at this moment the only statement possible is the one we are making through the mouths of our cannon    but there was an undercurrent of real anxiety in the tide of victory  the question of finances  instead of opening the banks  as had been ordered by the military revolutionary committee  the union of bank employees had held a meeting and declared a formal strike  smolny had demanded some thirty five millions of rubles from the state bank  and the cashier had locked the vaults  only paying out money to the representatives of the provisional government  the reactionaries were using the state bank as a political weapon  for instance  when the  vikzhel  demanded money to pay the salaries of the employees of the government railroads  it was told to apply to smolny      i went to the state bank to see the new commissar  a redhaired ukrainean bolshevik named petrovitch  he was trying to bring order out of the chaos in which affairs had been left by the striking clerks  in all the offices of the huge place perspiring volunteer workers  soldiers and sailors  their tongues sticking out of their mouths in the intensity of their effort  were poring over the great ledgers with a bewildered air      the duma building was crowded  there were still isolated cases of defiance toward the new government  but they were rare  the central land committee had appealed to the peasants  ordering them not to recognise the land decree passed by the congress of the soviets  because it would cause confusion and civil war  mayor schreider announced that because of the bolshevik insurrection  the elections to the constituent assembly would have to be indefinitely postponed   two questions seemed to be uppermost in all minds  shocked by the ferocity of the civil war  first  a truce to the bloodshed  see app  ix  sect  3  second  the creation of a new government  there was no longer any talk of  destroying the bolsheviki  and very little about excluding them from the government  except from the populist socialists and the peasants  soviets  even the central army committee at the  stavka   the most determined enemy of smolny  telephoned from moghilev   if  to constitute the new ministry  it is necessary to come to an understanding with the bolsheviki  we agree to admit them  in a minority  to the cabinet     pravda   ironically calling attention to kerensky s  humanitarian sentiments   published his despatch to the committee for salvation   in accord with the proposals of the committee for salvation and all the democratic organisations united around it  i have halted all military action against the rebels  a delegate of the committee has been sent to enter into negotiations  take all measures to stop the useless shedding of blood   the  vikzhel  sent a telegram to all russia   the conference of the union of railway workers with the representatives of both the belligerent parties  who admit the necessity of an agreement  protest energetically against the use of political terrorism in the civil war  especially when it is carried on between different factions of the revolutionary democracy  and declare that political terrorism  in whatever form  is in contradiction to the very idea of the negotiations for a new government       graphic page 227 leaflet    popular leaflet sold in the streets just after the bolshevik insurrection  containing rhymes and jokes about the defeated bourgeoisie and the  moderate  socialist leaders  called   how the boorzhui  bourgeoisie  lost the power    delegations from the conference were sent to the front  to gatchina  in the conference itself everything seemed on the point of final settlement  it had even been decided to elect a provisional people s council  composed of about four hundred members seventy five representing smolny  seventy five the old  tsay ee kah   and the rest split up among the town dumas  the trade unions  land committees and political parties  tchernov was mentioned as the new premier  lenin and trotzky  rumour said  were to be excluded      about noon i was again in front of smolny  talking with the driver of an ambulance bound for the revolutionary front  could i go with him  certainly  he was a volunteer  a university student  and as we rolled down the street shouted over his shoulder to me phrases of execrable german    also  gut  wir nach die kasernen zu essen gehen    i made out that there would be lunch at some barracks   on the kirotchnaya we turned into an immense courtyard surrounded by military buildings  and mounted a dark stairway to a low room lit by one window  at a long wooden table were seated some twenty soldiers  eating  shtchi   cabbage soup  from a great tin wash tub with wooden spoons  and talking loudly with much laughter    welcome to the battalion committee of the sixth reserve engineers  battalion   cried my friend  and introduced me as an american socialist  whereat every one rose to shake my hand  and one old soldier put his arms around me and gave me a hearty kiss  a wooden spoon was produced and i took my place at the table  another tub  full of  kasha   was brought in  a huge loaf of black bread  and of course the inevitable tea pots  at once every one began asking me questions about america  was it true that people in a free country sold their votes for  money   if so  how did they get what they wanted  how about this  tammany   was it true that in a free country a little group of people could control a whole city  and exploited it for their personal benefit  why did the people stand it  even under the tsar such things could not happen in russia  true  here there was always graft  but to buy and sell a whole city full of people  and in a free country  had the people no revolutionary feeling  i tried to explain that in my country people tried to change things by law    of course   nodded a young sergeant  named baklanov  who spoke french   but you have a highly developed capitalist class  then the capitalist class must control the legislatures and the courts  how then can the people change things  i am open to conviction  for i do not know your country  but to me it is incredible       i said that i was going to tsarskoye selo   i  too   said baklanov  suddenly   and i and i   the whole roomful decided on the spot to go to tsarskoye selo   just then came a knock on the door  it opened  and in it stood the figure of the colonel  no one rose  but all shouted a greeting   may i come in   asked the colonel    prosim  prosim    they answered heartily  he entered  smiling  a tall  distinguished figure in a goat skin cape embroidered with gold   i think i heard you say that you were going to tsarskoye selo  comrades   he said   could i go with you    baklanov considered   i do not think there is anything to be done here to day   he answered   yes  comrade  we shall be very glad to have you   the colonel thanked him and sat down  filling a glass of tea   in a low voice  for fear of wounding the colonel s pride  baklanov explained to me   you see  i am the chairman of the committee  we control the battalion absolutely  except in action  when the colonel is delegated by us to command  in action his orders must be obeyed  but he is strictly responsible to us  in barracks he must ask our permission before taking any action     you might call him our executive officer       arms were distributed to us  revolvers and rifles  we might meet some cossacks  you know  and we all piled into the ambulance  together with three great bundles of newspapers for the front  straight down the liteiny we rattled  and along the zagorodny prospekt  next to me sat a youth with the shoulder straps of a lieutenant  who seemed to speak all european languages with equal fluency  he was a member of the battalion committee    i am not a bolshevik   he assured me  emphatically   my family is a very ancient and noble one  i  myself  am  you might say  a cadet        but how     i began  bewildered    oh  yes  i am a member of the committee  i make no secret of my political opinions  but the others do not mind  because they know i do not believe in opposing the will of the majority     i have refused to take any action in the present civil war  however  for i do not believe in taking up arms against my brother russians        provocator  kornilovitz   the others cried at him gaily  slapping him on the shoulder      passing under the huge grey stone archway of the moskovsky gate  covered with golden hieroglyphics  ponderous imperial eagles and the names of tsars  we sped out on the wide straight highway  grey with the first light fall of snow  it was thronged with red guards  stumbling along on foot toward the revolutionary front  shouting and singing  and others  greyfaced and muddy  coming back  most of them seemed to be mere boys  women with spades  some with rifles and bandoleers  others wearing the red cross on their arm bands the bowed  toil worm women of the slums  squads of soldiers marching out of step  with an affectionate jeer for the red guards  sailors  grim looking  children with bundles of food for their fathers and mothers  all these  coming and going  trudged through the whitened mud that covered the cobbles of the highway inches deep  we passed cannon  jingling southward with their caissons  trucks bound both ways  bristling with armed men  ambulances full of wounded from the direction of the battle  and once a peasant cart  creaking slowly along  in which sat a white faced boy bent over his shattered stomach and screaming monotonously  in the fields on either side women and old men were digging trenches and stringing barbed wire entanglements   back northward the clouds rolled away dramatically  and the pale sun came out  across the flat  marshy plain petrograd glittered  to the right  white and gilded and coloured bulbs and pinnacles  to the left  tall chimneys  some pouring out black smoke  and beyond  a lowering sky over finland  on each side of us were churches  monasteries     occasionally a monk was visible  silently watching the pulse of the proletarian army throbbing on the road   at pulkovo the road divided  and there we halted in the midst of a great crowd  where the human streams poured from three directions  friends meeting  excited and congratulatory  describing the battle to one another  a row of houses facing the cross roads was marked with bullets  and the earth was trampled into mud half a mile around  the fighting had been furious here     in the near distance riderless cossack horses circled hungrily  for the grass of the plain had died long ago  right in front of us an awkward red guard was trying to ride one  falling off again and again  to the childlike delight of a thousand rough men   the left road  along which the remnants of the cossacks had retreated  led up a little hill to a hamlet  where there was a glorious view of the immense plain  grey as a windless sea  tumultuous clouds towering over  and the imperial city disgorging its thousands along all the roads  far over to the left lay the little hill of kranoye selo  the parade ground of the imperial guards  summer camp  and the imperial dairy  in the middle distance nothing broke the flat monotony but a few walled monasteries and convents  some isolated factories  and several large buildings with unkempt grounds that were asylums and orphanages       here   said the driver  as we went on over a barren hill   here was where vera slutskaya died  yes  the bolshevik member of the duma  it happened early this morning  she was in an automobile  with zalkind and another man  there was a truce  and they started for the front trenches  they were talking and laughing  when all of a sudden  from the armoured train in which kerensky himself was riding  somebody saw the automobile and fired a cannon  the shell struck vera slutskaya and killed her       and so we came into tsarskoye  all bustling with the swaggering heroes of the proletarian horde  now the palace where the soviet had met was a busy place  red guards and sailors filled the court yard  sentries stood at the doors  and a stream of couriers and commissars pushed in and out  in the soviet room a samovar had been set up  and fifty or more workers  soldiers  sailors and officers stood around  drinking tea and talking at the top of their voices  in one corner two clumsy handed workingmen were trying to make a multigraphing machine go  at the centre table  the huge dybenko bent over a map  marking out positions for the troops with red and blue pencils  in his free hand he carried  as always  the enormous bluesteel revolver  anon he sat himself down at a typewriter and pounded away with one finger  every little while he would pause  pick up the revolver  and lovingly spin the chamber   a couch lay along the wall  and on this was stretched a young workman  two red guards were bending over him  but the rest of the company did not pay any attention  in his breast was a hole  through his clothes fresh blood came welling up with every heart beat  his eyes were closed and his young  bearded face was greenish white  faintly and slowly he still breathed  with every breath sighing    mir boudit  mir boudit    peace is coming  peace is coming     dybenko looked up as we came in   ah   he said to baklanov   comrade  will you go up to the commandant s headquarters and take charge  wait  i will write you credentials   he went to the typewriter and slowly picked out the letters   the new commandant of tsarskoye selo and i went toward the ekaterina palace  baklanov very excited and important  in the same ornate  white room some red guards were rummaging curiously around  while my old friend  the colonel  stood by the window biting his moustache  he greeted me like a long lost brother  at a table near the door sat the french bessarabian  the bolsheviki had ordered him to remain  and continue his work    what could i do   he muttered   people like myself cannot fight on either side in such a war as this  no matter how much we may instinctively dislike the dictatorship of the mob     i only regret that i am so far from my mother in bessarabia    baklanov was formally taking over the office from the commandant   here   said the colonel nervously   are the keys to the desk    a red guard interrupted   where s the money   he asked rudely  the colonel seemed surprised   money  money  ah  you mean the chest  there it is   said the colonel   just as i found it when i took possession three days ago  keys   the colonel shrugged   i have no keys    the red guard sneered knowingly   very convenient   he said    let us open the chest   said baklanov   bring an axe  here is an american comrade  let him smash the chest open  and write down what he finds there    i swung the axe  the wooden chest was empty    let s arrest him   said the red guard  venomously   he is kerensky s man  he has stolen the money and given it to kerensky    baklanov did not want to   oh  no   he said   it was the kornilovitz before him  he is not to blame    the devil   cried the red guard   he is kerensky s man  i tell you  if  you  won t arrest him  then  we  will  and we ll take him to petrograd and put him in peter paul  where he belongs   at this the other red guards growled assent  with a piteous glance at us the colonel was led away      down in front of the soviet palace an auto truck was going to the front  half a dozen red guards  some sailors  and a soldier or two  under command of a huge workman  clambered in  and shouted to me to come along  red guards issued from headquarters  each of them staggering under an arm load of small  corrugated iron bombs  filled with  grubit  which  they say  is ten times as strong  and five times as sensitive as dynamite  these they threw into the truck  a three inch cannon was loaded and then tied onto the tail of the truck with bits of rope and wire   we started with a shout  at top speed of course  the heavy truck swaying from side to side  the cannon leaped from one wheel to the other  and the  grubit  bombs went rolling back and forth over our feet  fetching up against the sides of the car with a crash   the big red guard  whose name was vladimir nicolaievitch  plied me with questions about america   why did america come into the war  are the american workers ready to throw over the capitalists  what is the situation in the mooney case now  will they extradite berkman to san francisco   and other  very difficult to answer  all delivered in a shout above the roaring of the truck  while we held on to each other and danced amid the caroming bombs   occasionally a patrol tried to stop us  soldiers ran out into the road before us  shouted   shtoi    and threw up their guns   we paid no attention   the devil take you   cried the red guards   we don t stop for anybody  we re red guards   and we thundered imperiously on  while vladimir nicolaievitch bellowed to me about the internationalisation of the panama canal  and such matters      about five miles out we saw a squad of sailors marching back  and slowed down    where s the front  brothers    the foremost sailor halted and scratched his head   this morning   he said   it was about half a kilometer down the road  but the damn thing isn t anywhere now  we walked and walked and walked  but we couldn t find it    they climbed into the truck  and we proceeded  it must have been about a mile further that vladimir nicolaievitch cocked his ear and shouted to the chauffeur to stop    firing   he said   do you hear it   for a moment dead silence  and then  a little ahead and to the left  three shots in rapid succession  along here the side of the road was heavily wooded  very much excited now  we crept along  speaking in whispers  until the truck was nearly opposite the place where the firing had come from  descending  we spread out  and every man carrying his rifle  went stealthily into the forest   two comrades  meanwhile  detached the cannon and slewed it around until it aimed as nearly as possible at our backs   it was silent in the woods  the leaves were gone  and the tree trunks were a pale wan colour in the low  sickly autumn sun  not a thing moved  except the ice of little woodland pools shivering under our feet  was it an ambush   we went uneventfully forward until the trees began to thin  and paused  beyond  in a little clearing  three soldiers sat around a small fire  perfectly oblivious   vladimir nicolaievitch stepped forward    zra zvuitye   comrades   he greeted  while behind him one cannon  twenty rifles and a truck load of  grubit  bombs hung by a hair  the soldiers scrambled to their feet    what was the shooting going on around here    one of the soldiers answered  looking relieved   why we were just shooting a rabbit or two  comrade       the truck hurtled on toward romanov  through the bright  empty day  at the first cross roads two soldiers ran out in front of us  waving their rifles  we slowed down  and stopped    passes  comrades    the red guards raised a great clamour   we are red guards  we don t need any passes     go on  never mind them    but a sailor objected   this is wrong  comrades  we must have revolutionary discipline  suppose some counterrevolutionaries came along in a truck and said   we don t need any passes   the comrades don t know you    at this there was a debate  one by one  however  the sailors and soldiers joined with the first  grumbling  each red guard produced his dirty  bumaga   paper   all were alike except mine  which had been issued by the revolutionary staff at smolny  the sentries declared that i must go with them  the red guards objected strenuously  but the sailor who had spoken first insisted   this comrade we know to be a true comrade   he said   but there are orders of the committee  and these orders must be obeyed  that is revolutionary discipline       in order not to make any trouble  i got down from the truck  and watched it disappear careening down the road  all the company waving farewell  the soldiers consulted in low tones for a moment  and then led me to a wall  against which they placed me  it flashed upon me suddenly  they were going to shoot me   in all three directions not a human being was in sight  the only sign of life was smoke from the chimney of a  datchya   a rambling wooden house a quarter of a mile up the side road  the two soldiers were walking out into the road  desperately i ran after them    but comrades  see  here is the seal of the military revolutionary committee    they stared stupidly at my pass  then at each other    it is different from the others   said one  sullenly   we cannot read  brother    i took him by the arm   come   i said   let s go to that house  some one there can surely read   they hesitated   no   said one  the other looked me over   why not   he muttered   after all  it is a serious crime to kill an innocent man    we walked up to the front door of the house and knocked  a short  stout woman opened it  and shrank back in alarm  babbling   i don t know anything about them  i don t know anything about them   one of my guards held out the pass  she screamed   just to read it  comrade   hesitatingly she took the paper and read aloud  swiftly   the bearer of this pass  john reed  is a representative of the american social democracy  an internationalist      out on the road again the two soldiers held another consultation   we must take you to the regimental committee   they said  in the fast deepening twilight we trudged along the muddy road  occasionally we met squads of soldiers  who stopped and surrounded me with looks of menace  handling my pass around and arguing violently as to whether or not i should be killed      it was dark when we came to the barracks of the second tsarskoye selo rifles  low sprawling buildings huddled along the post road  a number of soldiers slouching at the entrance asked eager questions  a spy  a provocator  we mounted a winding stair and emerged into a great  bare room with a huge stove in the centre  and rows of cots on the floor  where about a thousand soldiers were playing cards  talking  singing  and asleep  in the roof was a jagged hole made by kerensky s cannon      i stood in the doorway  and a sudden silence ran among the groups  who turned and stared at me  of a sudden they began to move  slowly and then with a rush  thundering  with faces full of hate   comrades  comrades   yelled one of my guards   committee  committee   the throng halted  banked around me  muttering  out of them shouldered a lean youth  wearing a red arm band    who is this   he asked roughly  the guards explained   give me the paper   he read it carefully  glancing at me with keen eyes  then he smiled and handed me the pass   comrades  this is an american comrade  i am chairman of the committee  and i welcome you to the regiment      a sudden general buzz grew into a roar of greeting  and they pressed forward to shake my hand    you have not dined  here we have had our dinner  you shall go to the officers  club  where there are some who speak your language       he led me across the court yard to the door of another building  an aristocratic looking youth  with the shoulder straps of a lieutenant  was entering  the chairman presented me  and shaking hands  went back    i am stepan georgevitch morovsky  at your service   said the lieutenant  in perfect french  from the ornate entrance hall a ceremonial staircase led upward  lighted by glittering lustres  on the second floor billiard rooms  card rooms  a library opened from the hall  we entered the dining room  at a long table in the centre of which sat about twenty officers in full uniform  wearing their gold  and silver handled swords  the ribbons and crosses of imperial decorations  all rose politely as i entered  and made a place for me beside the colonel  a large  impressive man with a grizzled beard  orderlies were deftly serving dinner  the atmosphere was that of any officers  mess in europe  where was the revolution    you are not bolsheviki   i asked morovsky   a smile went around the table  but i caught one or two glancing furtively at the orderly    no   answered my friend   there is only one bolshevik officer in this regiment  he is in petrograd to night  the colonel is a menshevik  captain kherlov there is a cadet  i myself am a socialist revolutionary of the right wing     i should say that most of the officers in the army are not bolsheviki  but like me they believe in democracy  they believe that they must follow the soldier masses       dinner over  maps were brought  and the colonel spread them out on the table  the rest crowded around to see    here   said the colonel  pointing to pencil marks   were our positions this morning  vladimir kyrilovitch  where is your company    captain kherlov pointed   according to orders  we occupied the position along this road  karsavin relieved me at five o clock    just then the door of the room opened  and there entered the chairman of the regimental committee  with another soldier  they joined the group behind the colonel  peering at the map               map                              good   said the colonel   now the cossacks have fallen back ten kilometres in our sector  i do not think it is necessary to take up advanced positions  gentlemen  for to night you will hold the present line  strengthening the positions by      if you please   interrupted the chairman of the regimental committee   the orders are to advance with all speed  and prepare to engage the cossacks north of gatchina in the morning  a crushing defeat is necessary  kindly make the proper dispositions    there was a short silence  the colonel again turned to the map   very well   he said  in a different voice   stepan georgevitch  you will please    rapidly tracing lines with a blue pencil  he gave his orders  while a sergeant made shorthand notes  the sergeant then withdrew  and ten minutes later returned with the orders typewritten  and one carbon copy  the chairman of the committee studied the map with a copy of the orders before him    all right   he said  rising  folding the carbon copy  he put it in his pocket  then he signed the other  stamped it with a round seal taken from his pocket  and presented it to the colonel      here was the revolution   i returned to the soviet palace in tsarskoye in the regimental staff automobile  still the crowds of workers  soldiers and sailors pouring in and out  still the choking press of trucks  armoured cars  cannon before the door  and the shouting  the laughter of unwonted victory  half a dozen red guards forced their way through  a priest in the middle  this was father ivan  they said  who had blessed the cossacks when they entered the town  i heard afterward that he was shot      see app  ix  sect  4   dybenko was just coming out  giving rapid orders right and left  in his hand he carried the big revolver  an automobile stood with racing engine at the kerb  alone  he climbed in the rear seat  and was off off to gatchina  to conquer kerensky   toward nightfall he arrived at the outskirts of the town  and went on afoot  what dybenko told the cossacks nobody knows  but the fact is that general krasnov and his staff and several thousand cossacks surrendered  and advised kerensky to do the same   see app  ix  sect  5   as for kerensky i reprint here the deposition made by general krasnov on the morning of november 14th    gatchina  november 14  1917  to day  about three o clock  a  m    i was summoned by the supreme commander  kerensky   he was very agitated  and very nervous     general   he said to me   you have betrayed me  your cossacks declare categorically that they will arrest me and deliver me to the sailors      yes   i answered   there is talk of it  and i know that you have no sympathy anywhere      but the officers say the same thing      yes  most of all it is the officers who are discontented with you      what shall i do  i ought to commit suicide      if you are an honorable man  you will go immediately to petrograd with a white flag  you will present yourself to the military revolutionary committee  and enter into negotiations as chief of the provisional government      all right  i will do that  general      i will give you a guard and ask that a sailor go with you      no  no  not a sailor  do you know whether it is true that dybenko is here      i don t know who dybenko is      he is my enemy     there is nothing to do  if you play for high stakes you must know how to take a chance      yes  i ll leave to night      why  that would be a flight  leave calmly and openly  so that every one can see that you are not running away      very well  but you must give me a guard on which i can count      good     i went out and called the cossack russkov  of the tenth regiment of the don  and ordered him to pick out ten cossacks to accompany the supreme commander  half an hour later the cossacks came to tell me that kerensky was not in his quarters  that he had run away    i gave the alarm and ordered that he be searched for  supposing that he could not have left gatchina  but he could not be found       and so kerensky fled  alone   disguised in the uniform of a sailor   and by that act lost whatever popularity he had retained among the russian masses      i went back to petrograd riding on the front seat of an auto truck  driven by a workman and filled with red guards  we had no kerosene  so our lights were not burning  the road was crowded with the proletarian army going home  and new reserves pouring out to take their places  immense trucks like ours  columns of artillery  wagons  loomed up in the night  without lights  as we were  we hurtled furiously on  wrenched right and left to avoid collisions that seemed inevitable  scraping wheels  followed by the epithets of pedestrians   across the horizon spread the glittering lights of the capital  immeasurably more splendid by night than by day  like a dike of jewels heaped on the barren plain   the old workman who drove held the wheel in one hand  while with the other he swept the far gleaming capital in an exultant gesture    mine   he cried  his face all alight   all mine now  my petrograd

party proudly claiming kerensky as a member all passionately protested that he could only be held responsible to the constituent assembly   on the evening of november 16th i watched two thousand red guards swing down the zagorodny prospekt behind a military band playing the  marseillaise  and how appropriate it sounded with blood red flags over the dark ranks of workmen  to welcome home again their brothers who had defended  red petrograd   in the bitter dusk they tramped  men and women  their tall bayonets swaying  through streets faintly lighted and slippery with mud  between silent crowds of bourgeois  contemptuous but fearful      all were against them business men  speculators  investors  land owners  army officers  politicians  teachers  students  professional men  shop keepers  clerks  agents  the other socialist parties hated the bolsheviki with an implacable hatred  on the side of the soviets were the rank and file of the workers  the sailors  all the undemoralised soldiers  the landless peasants  and a few a very few intellectuals      from the farthest corners of great russia  whereupon desperate street fighting burst like a wave  news of

artillery against the last strong hold of the bourgeoisie the kremlin    they are bombarding the kremlin   the news passed from mouth to mouth in the streets of petrograd  almost with a sense of terror  travellers from  white and shining little mother moscow  told fearful tales  thousands killed  the tverskaya and the kuznetsky most in flames  the church of vasili blazheiny a smoking ruin  usspensky cathedral crumbling down  the spasskaya gate of the kremlin tottering  the duma burned to the ground   see app  x  sect  1   nothing that the bolsheviki had done could compare with this fearful blasphemy in the heart of holy russia  to the ears of the devout sounded the shock of guns crashing in the face of the holy orthodox church  and pounding to dust the sanctuary of the russian nation      on november 15th  lunatcharsky  commissar of education  broke into tears at the session of the council of people s commissars  and rushed from the room  crying   i cannot stand it  i cannot bear the monstrous destruction of beauty and tradition       that afternoon his letter of resignation was published in the newspapers   i have just been informed  by people arriving from moscow  what has happened there   the cathedral of st  basil the blessed  the cathedral of the assumption  are being bombarded  the kremlin  where are now gathered the most important art treasures of petrograd and of moscow  is under artillery fire  there are thousands of victims   the fearful struggle there has reached a pitch of bestial ferocity   what is left  what more can happen   i cannot bear this  my cup is full  i am unable to endure these horrors  it is impossible to work under the pressure of thoughts which drive me mad   that is why i am leaving the council of people s commissars   i fully realise the gravity of this decision  but i can bear no more      see app  x  sect  2   that same day the white guards and  yunkers  in the kremlin surrendered  and were allowed to march out

to ensure punctual obedience to this order   5  at the signature of the treaty  all prisoners made by the two parties shall be released      for two days now the bolsheviki had been in control of the city  the frightened citizens were creeping out of their cellars to seek their dead  the barricades in the streets were being removed  instead of diminishing  however  the stories of destruction in moscow continued to grow     and it was under the influence of these fearful reports that we decided to go there   petrograd  after all  in spite of being for a century the seat of government  is still an artificial city  moscow is real russia  russia as it was and will be  in moscow we would get the true feeling of the russian people about the revolution  life was more intense there   for the past week the petrograd military revolutionary committee  aided by the rank and file of the railway workers  had seized control of the nicolai railroad  and hurled trainload after trainload of sailors and red guards southwest     we were provided with passes from smolny  without which no one could leave the capital     when the train backed into the station  a mob of shabby soldiers  all carrying huge sacks of eatables  stormed the doors  smashed the windows  and poured into all the compartments  filling up the aisles and even climbing onto the roof  three of us managed to wedge our way into a compartment  but almost immediately about twenty soldiers entered     there was room for only four people  we argued  expostulated  and the conductor joined us but the soldiers merely laughed  were they to bother about the comfort of a lot of  boorzhui   bourgeois   we produced the passes from smolny  instantly the soldiers changed their attitude    come  comrades   cried one   these are american  tovarishtchi   they have come thirty thousand versts to see our revolution  and they are naturally tired       with polite and friendly apologies the soldiers began to leave  shortly afterward we heard them breaking into a compartment occupied by two stout  well dressed russians  who had bribed the conductor and locked their door      about seven o clock in the evening we drew out of the station  an immense long train drawn by a weak little locomotive burning wood  and stumbled along slowly  with many stops  the soldiers on the roof kicked with their heels and sang whining peasant songs  and in the corridor  so jammed that it was impossible to pass  violent political debates raged all night long  occasionally the conductor came through  as a matter of habit  looking for tickets  he found very few except ours  and after a half hour of futile wrangling  lifted his arms despairingly and withdrew  the atmosphere was stifling  full of smoke and foul odours  if it hadn t been for the broken windows we would doubtless have smothered during the night   in the morning  hours late  we looked out upon a snowy world  it was bitter cold  about noon a peasant woman got on with a basket full of bread chunks and a great can of luke warm coffee substitute  from then on until dark there was nothing but the packed train  jolting and stopping  and occasional stations where a ravenous mob swooped down on the scantily furnished buffet and swept it clean     at one of these halts i ran into nogin and rykov  the seceding commissars  who were returning to moscow to put their grievances before their own soviet   1and further along was bukharin  a short  red bearded man with the eyes of a fanatic  more left than lenin   they said of him      then the three strokes of the bell and we made a rush for the train  worming our way through the packed and noisy aisle     a good natured crowd  bearing the discomfort with humorous patience  interminably arguing about everything from the situation in petrograd to the british trade union system  and disputing loudly with the few  boorzhui  who were on board  before we reached moscow almost every car had organised a committee to secure and distribute food  and these committees became divided into political factions  who wrangled over fundamental principles      the station at moscow was deserted  we went to the office of the commissar  in order to arrange for our return tickets  he was a sullen youth with the shoulder straps of a lieutenant  when we showed him our papers from smolny  he lost his temper and declared that he was no bolshevik  that he represented the committee of public safety     it was characteristic in the general turmoil attending the conquest of the city  the chief railway station had been forgotten by the victors      not a cab in sight  a few blocks down the street  however  we woke up a grotesquely padded  izvostchik  asleep upright on the box of his little sleigh   how much to the centre of the town    he scratched his head   the  barini  won t be able to find a room in any hotel   he said   but i ll take you around for a hundred rubles      before the revolution it cost  two   we objected  but he simply shrugged his shoulders   it takes a good deal of courage to drive a sleigh nowadays   he went on  we could not beat him down below fifty     as we sped along the silent  snowy half lighted streets  he recounted his adventures during the six days  fighting   driving along  or waiting for a fare on the corner   he said   all of a sudden  pooff   a cannon ball exploding here   pooff   a cannon ball there   ratt ratt   a machine gun     i gallop  the devils shooting all around  i get to a nice quiet street and stop  doze a little   pooff   another cannon ball   ratt

hurried along the side walks  an icy wind blew from the great plain  cutting to the bone  at the first hotel we entered an office illuminated by two candles    yes  we have some very comfortable rooms  but all the windows are shot out  if the  gospodin  does not mind a little fresh air       down the tverskaya the shop windows were broken  and there were shell holes and torn up paving stones in the street  hotel after hotel  all full  or the proprietors still so frightened that all they could say was   no  no  there is no room  there is no room   on the main streets  where the great banking houses and mercantile houses lay  the bolshevik artillery had been indiscriminately effective  as one soviet official told me   whenever we didn t know just where the  yunkers  and white guards were  we bombarded their pocketbooks       at the big hotel national they finally took us in  for we were foreigners  and the military revolutionary committee had promised to protect the dwellings of foreigners     on the top floor the manager showed us where shrapnel had shattered several windows   the animals   said he  shaking his first at imaginary bolsheviki   but wait  their time will come  in just a few days now their ridiculous government will fall  and then we shall make them suffer    we dined at a vegetarian restaurant with the enticing name   i eat nobody   and tolstoy s picture

square  red guards stood sentry at the door  at the head of the wide  formal stairway  whose walls were plastered with announcements of committee meetings and addresses of political parties  we passed through a series of lofty ante rooms  hung with red shrouded pictures in gold frames  to the splendid state salon  with its magnificent crystal lustres and gilded cornices  a low voiced hum of talk  underlaid with the whirring bass of a score of sewing machines  filled the place  huge bolts of red and black cotton cloth were unrolled  serpentining across the parqueted floor and over tables  at which sat half a hundred women  cutting and sewing streamers and banners for the funeral of the revolutionary dead  the faces of these women were roughened and scarred with life at its most difficult  they worked now sternly  many of them with eyes red from weeping     the losses of the red army had been heavy   at a desk in one corner was rogov  an intelligent  bearded man with glasses  wearing the black blouse of a worker  he invited us to march with the central executive committee in the funeral procession next morning       it is impossible to teach the socialist revolutionaries and the mensheviki anything   he exclaimed   they compromise from sheer habit  imagine  they proposed that we hold a joint funeral with the  yunkers      graphic page 251 questionairre for the bourgeoioisie

swiped my overcoat  my money  watch and even the ring on my finger  this is all i ve got to wear    from him i learned many details of the bloody six day battle which had rent moscow in two  unlike in

 the regiment held a meeting to decide what action to take  resolved  that the regiment remain neutral  and continue its present activities which consisted in peddling rubbers and sunflower seeds    but worst of all   said melnichansky   we had to organise while we were fighting  the other side knew just what it wanted  but here the soldiers had their soviet and the workers theirs     there was a fearful wrangle over who should be commander in chief  some regiments talked for days before they decided what to do  and when the officers suddenly deserted us  we had no battle staff to give orders       vivid little pictures he gave me  on a cold grey day he had stood at a corner of the nikitskaya  which was swept by blasts of machine gun fire  a throng of little boys were gathered there street waifs who used to be newsboys  shrill  excited as if with a new game  they waited until the firing slackened  and then tried to run across the street     many were killed  but the rest dashed backward

were plainly with him  it was very late before the workers arrived  the working class quarters were on the outskirts of the town  and no street cars were running  but about midnight they began to clump up the stairs  in groups of ten or twenty big  rough men  in coarse clothes  fresh from the battle line  where they had fought like devils for a week  seeing their comrades fall all about them   scarcely had the meeting formally opened before nogin was assailed with a tempest of jeers and angry shouts  in vain he tried to argue  to explain  they would not listen  he had left the council of

blazheiny loomed fantastic  its bright coloured  convoluted and blazoned cupolas vague in the darkness  there was no sign of any damage     along one side of the square the dark towers and walls of the kremlin stood up  on the high walls flickered redly the light of hidden flames  voices reached us across the immense place  and the sound of picks and shovels  we crossed over   mountains of dirt and rock were piled high near the base of the wall  climbing these we looked down into two massive pits  ten or fifteen feet deep and fifty yards long  where hundreds of soldiers and workers were digging in the light of huge fires   a young student spoke to us in german   the brotherhood grave   he explained   to morrow we shall bury here five hundred proletarians who died for the revolution    he took us down into the pit  in frantic haste swung the picks and shovels  and the earth mountains grew  no one spoke  overhead the night was thick with stars  and the ancient imperial kremlin wall

that the tsar was not the only tyrant in the world  capitalism was worse  and in all the countries of the world capitalism was emperor     russian revolutionary tactics are best       as we left  the workers in the pit  exhausted and running with sweat in spite of the cold  began to climb wearily out  across the red square a dark knot of men came hurrying  they swarmed into the pits  picked up the tools and began digging  digging  without a word      so  all the long night volunteers of the people relieved each other  never halting in their driving speed  and the cold light of the dawn laid bare the great square  white with snow  and the yawning brown pits of the brotherhood grave  quite finished   we rose before sunrise  and hurried through the dark streets to skobeliev square  in all the great city not a human being could be seen  but there was a faint sound of stirring  far and near  like a deep wind coming  in the pale half light a little group of men and women were gathered before the soviet headquarters  with a sheaf of gold lettered red banners the central executive committee of the moscow soviets  it grew light  from afar the vague stirring sound deepened and became louder  a steady and tremendous bass  the city was rising  we set out down the tverskaya  the banners flapping overhead  the little street chapels along our way were locked and dark  as was the chapel of the iberian virgin  which each new tsar used to visit before he went to the kremlin to crown himself  and which  day or night  was always open and crowded  and brilliant with the candles of the devout gleaming on the gold and silver and jewels of the ikons  now  for the first time since napoleon was in moscow  they say  the candles were out   the holy orthodox church had withdrawn the light

the iberian gate a human river was flowing  and the vast red square was spotted with people  thousands of them  i remarked that as the throng passed the iberian chapel  where always before the passerby had crossed himself  they did not seem to notice it      we forced our way through the dense mass packed near the kremlin wall  and stood upon one of the dirt mountains  already several men were there  among them muranov  the soldier who had been elected commandant of moscow a tall  simple looking  bearded man with a gentle face   through all the streets to the red square the torrents of people poured  thousands upon thousands of them  all with the look of the poor and the toiling  a military band came marching up  playing the  internationale   and spontaneously the song caught and spread like wind ripples on a sea  slow and solemn  from the top of the kremlin wall gigantic banners unrolled to the ground  red  with great letters in gold and in white  saying   martyrs of the beginning of world social revolution   and  long live the brotherhood of workers of the world    a bitter wind swept the square  lifting the banners  now from the far quarters of the city the workers of the different factories were arriving  with their dead  they could be seen coming through the gate  the blare of their banners  and the dull red like blood of the coffins they carried  these were rude boxes  made of unplaned wood and daubed with crimson  borne high on the shoulders of rough men who marched with tears streaming down their faces  and followed by women who sobbed and screamed  or walked stiffly  with white  dead faces  some of the coffins were open  the lid carried behind them  others were covered with gilded or silvered cloth  or had a soldier s hat nailed on the top  there were many wreaths of hideous artificial flowers      through an irregular lane that opened and closed again the procession slowly moved toward us  now through the gate was flowing an endless stream of banners  all shades of red  with silver and gold lettering  knots of crepe hanging from the top and some anarchist flags  black with white letters  the band was playing the revolutionary funeral march  and against the immense singing of the mass of people  standing uncovered  the paraders sang hoarsely  choked with sobs      between the factory workers came companies of soldiers with their coffins  too  and squadrons of cavalry  riding at salute  and artillery batteries  the cannon wound with red and black forever  it seemed  their banners said   long live the third international   or  we want an honest  general  democratic peace    slowly the marchers came with their coffins to the entrance of the grave  and the bearers clambered up with their burdens and went down into the pit  many of them were women squat  strong proletarian women  behind the dead came other women women young and broken  or old  wrinkled women making noises like hurt animals  who tried to follow their sons and husbands into the brotherhood grave  and shrieked when compassionate hands restrained them  the poor love each other so   all the long day the funeral procession passed  coming in by the iberian gate and leaving the square by way of the nikolskaya  a river of red banners  bearing words of hope and brotherhood and stupendous prophecies  against a back ground of fifty thousand people  under the eyes of the world s workers and their descendants forever      one by one the five hundred coffins were laid in the pits  dusk fell  and still the banners came drooping and fluttering  the band played the funeral march  and the huge assemblage chanted  in the leafless branches of the trees above the grave the wreaths were hung  like strange  multi coloured blossoms  two hundred men began to shovel in the dirt  it rained dully down upon the coffins with a thudding sound  audible beneath the singing      the lights came out  the last banners passed  and the last moaning women  looking back with awful intensity as they went  slowly from the great square ebbed the proletarian tide      i suddenly realised that the devout russian people no longer needed priests to pray them into heaven  on earth they were building a kingdom more bright than any heaven had to offer  and for which it was a glory to die                                    chapter xi                  the conquest of power

looking up at the building as if god were in it  some pointed out the imperial eagles over the door  laughing     red guards came to mount guard  all the soldiers turned to look  curiously  as if they had heard of them but never seen them  they laughed good naturedly and pressed out of line to slap the red guards on the back  with half joking  half admiring remarks      the provisional government was no more  on november 15th  in all the churches of the capital  the priests stopped praying for it  but as lenin himself told the  tsay ee kah   that was  only the beginning of the conquest of power   deprived of arms  the opposition  which still controlled the economic life of the country  settled down to organise disorganisation  with all the russian genius for cooperative action to obstruct  cripple and discredit the soviets   the strike of government employees was well organised  financed by the banks and commercial establishments  every move of the bolsheviki to take over the government apparatus was resisted   trotzky went to the ministry of foreign affairs  the functionaries refused to recognise him  locked themselves in  and when the doors were forced  resigned  he demanded the keys of the archives  only when he brought workmen to force the locks were they given up  then it was discovered that neratov  former assistant foreign minister  had disappeared with the secret treaties      shliapnikov tried to take possession of the ministry of labour  it was bitterly cold  and there was no one to light the fires  of all the hundreds of employees  not one would show him where the office of the minister was      alexandra kollontai  appointed the 13th of november commissar of public welfare the department of charities and public institutions was welcomed with a strike of all but forty of the functionaries in the ministry  immediately the poor of the great cities  the inmates of institutions  were plunged in miserable want  delegations of starving cripples  of orphans with blue  pinched faces  besieged the building  with tears streaming down her face  kollontai arrested the strikers until they should deliver the keys of the office and the safe  when she got the keys  however  it was discovered that the former minister  countess panina  had gone off with all the funds  which she refused to surrender except on the order of the constituent assembly   see app  xi  sect  4   in the ministry of agriculture  the ministry of supplies  the ministry of finance  similar incidents occurred  and the employees  summoned to return or forfeit their positions and their pensions  either stayed away or returned to sabotage     almost all the  intelligentzia  being anti bolshevik  there was nowhere for the soviet government to recruit new staffs      the private banks remained stubbornly closed  with a back door open for speculators  when bolshevik commissars entered  the clerks left  secreting the books and removing the funds  all the employees of the state bank struck except the clerks in charge of the vaults and the manufacture of money  who refused all demands from smolny and privately paid out huge sums to the committee for salvation and the city duma   twice a commissar  with a company of red guards  came formally to insist upon the delivery of large sums for government expenses  the first time  the city duma members and the menshevik and socialist revolutionary leaders were present in imposing numbers  and spoke so gravely of the consequences that the commissar was frightened  the second time he arrived with a warrant  which he proceeded to read aloud in due form  but some one called his attention to the fact that it had no date and no seal  and the traditional russian respect for  documents  forced him again to withdraw      the officials of the credit chancery destroyed their books  so that all record of the financial relations of russia with foreign countries was lost   the supply committees  the administrations of the municipal owned public utilities  either did not work at all  or sabotaged  and when the bolsheviki  compelled by the desperate needs of the city population  attempted to help or to control the public service  all the employees went on strike immediately  and the duma flooded russia with telegrams about bolshevik  violation of municipal autonomy    at military headquarters  and in the offices of the ministries of war and marine  where the old officials had consented to work  the army committees and the high command blocked the soviets in every way possible  even to the extent of neglecting the troops at the front  the  vikzhel  was hostile  refusing to transport soviet troops  every troop train that left petrograd was taken out by force  and railway officials had to be arrested each time whereupon the  vikzhel  threatened an immediate general strike unless they were released      smolny was plainly powerless  the newspapers said that all the factories of petrograd must shut down for lack of fuel in three weeks  the  vikzhel  announced that trains must cease running by december first  there was food for three days only in petrograd  and no more coming in  and the army on the front was starving     the committee for salvation  the various central committees  sent word all over the country  exhorting the population to ignore the government decrees  and the allied embassies were either coldly indifferent  or openly hostile      the opposition newspapers  suppressed one day and reappearing next morning under new names  heaped bitter sarcasm on the new regime   see app  xi  sect  5  even  novaya zhizn  characterised it as  a combination of demagoguery and impotence    from day to day  it said  the government of the people s commissars sinks deeper and deeper into the mire of superficial haste  having easily conquered the power    the bolsheviki can not make use of it   powerless to direct the existing mechanism of government  they are unable at the same time to create a new one which might work easily and freely according to the theories of social experimenters   just a little while ago the bolsheviki hadn t enough men to run their growing party a work above all of speakers and writers  where then are they going to find trained men to execute the diverse and complicated functions of government   the new government acts and threatens  it sprays the country with decrees  each one more radical and more  socialist  than the last  but in this exhibition of socialism on paper more likely designed for the stupefaction of our descendants there appears neither the desire nor the capacity to solve the immediate problems of the day   meanwhile the  vikzhel s  conference to form a new government continued to meet night and day  both sides had already agreed in principle to the basis of the government  the composition of the people s council was being discussed  the cabinet was tentatively chosen  with tchernov as premier  the bolsheviki were admitted in a large minority  but lenin and trotzky were barred  the central committees of the menshevik and socialist revolutionary parties  the executive committee of the peasant s soviets  resolved that  although unalterably opposed to the  criminal politics  of the bolsheviki  they would   in order to halt the fratricidal bloodshed   not oppose their entrance into the people s council   the flight of kerensky  however  and the astounding success of the soviets everywhere  altered the situation  on the 16th  in a meeting of the  tsay ee kah   the left socialist revolutionaries insisted that the bolsheviki should form a coalition government with the other socialist parties  otherwise they would withdraw from the military revolutionary committee and the  tsay ee kah   malkin said   the news from moscow  where our comrades are dying on both sides of the barricades  determines us to bring up once more the question of organisation of power  and it is not only our right to do so  but our duty     we have won the right to sit with the bolsheviki here within the walls of smolny institute  and to speak from this tribune  after the bitter internal party struggle  we shall be obliged  if you refuse to compromise  to pass to open battle outside     we must propose to the democracy terms of an acceptable compromise       after a recess to consider this ultimatum  the bolsheviki returned with a resolution  read by kameniev   the  tsay ee kah  considers it necessary that there enter into the government representatives of  all the socialist parties composing the soviets of workers   soldiers  and peasants  deputies who recognise the conquests of the revolution of november 7th that is to say  the establishment of a government of soviets  the decrees on peace  land  workers  control over industry  and the arming of the working class   the  tsay ee kah  therefore resolves to propose negotiations concerning the constitution of the government to all parties  of the soviet   and insists upon the following conditions as a basis   the government is responsible to the  tsay ee kah   the  tsay ee kah  shall be enlarged to 150 members  to these 150 delegates of the soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies shall be added 75 delegates of the  provincial  soviets of peasants  deputies  80 from the front organisations of the army and navy  40 from the trade unions  25 from the various all russian unions  in proportion to their importance  10 from the  vikzhel   and 5 from the post and telegraph workers   and 50 delegates from the socialist groups in the petrograd city duma  in the ministry itself  at least one half the portfolios must be reserved to the bolsheviki  the ministries of labour  interior and foreign affairs must be given to the bolsheviki  the command of the garrisons of petrograd and moscow must remain in the hands of delegates of the moscow and petrograd soviets   the government undertakes the systematic arming of the workers of all russia   it is resolved to insist upon the candidature of comrades lenin and trotzky   kameniev explained   the so called  people s council    he said   proposed by the conference  would consist of about 420 members  of which about 150 would be bolsheviki  besides  there would be delegates from the counter revolutionary old  tsay ee kah   100 members chosen by the municipal dumas kornilovtsi all  100 delegates from the peasants  soviets appointed by avksentiev  and 80 from the old army committees  who no longer represent the soldier masses    we refuse to admit the old  tsay ee kah   and also the representatives of the municipal dumas  the delegates from the peasants  soviets shall be elected by the congress of peasants  which we have called  and which will at the same time elect a new executive committee  the proposal to exclude lenin and trotzky is a proposal to decapitate our party  and we do not accept it  and finally  we see no necessity for a  people s council  anyway  the soviets are open to all socialist parties  and the  tsay ee kah  represents them in their real proportions among the masses       karelin  for the left socialist revolutionaries  declared that his party would vote for the bolshevik resolution  reserving the right to modify certain details  such as the representation of the peasants  and demanding that the ministry of agriculture be reserved for the left socialist revolutionaries  this was agreed to      later  at a meeting of the petrograd soviet  trotzky answered a question about the formation of the new government    i don t know anything about that  i am not taking part in the negotiations     however  i don t think that they are of great importance       that night there was great uneasiness in the conference  the delegates of the city duma withdrew      but at smolny itself  in the ranks of the bolshevik party  a formidable opposition to lenin s policy was growing  on the night of november 17th the great hall was packed and ominous for the meeting of the  tsay ee kah    larin  bolshevik  declared that the moment of elections to the constituent assembly approached  and it was time to do away with  political terrorism     the measures taken against the freedom of the press should be modified  they had their reason during the struggle  but now they have no further excuse  the press should be free  except for appeals to riot and insurrection    in a storm of hisses and hoots from his own party  larin offered the following resolution   the decree of the council of people s commissars concerning the press is herewith repealed   measures of political repression can only be employed subject to decision of a special tribunal  elected by the  tsay ee kah  proportionally to the strength of the different parties represented  and this tribunal shall have the right also to reconsider measures of repression already taken   this was met by a thunder of applause  not only from the left socialist revolutionaries  but also from a part of the bolsheviki   avanessov  for the leninites  hastily proposed that the question of the press be postponed until after some compromise between the socialist parties had been reached  overwhelmingly voted down    the revolution which is now being accomplished   went on avanessov   has not hesitated to attack private property  and it is as private property that we must examine the question of the press       thereupon he read the official bolshevik resolution   the suppression of the bourgeois press was dictated not only by purely military needs in the course of the insurrection  and for the checking of counter revolutionary action  but it is also necessary as a measure of transition toward the establishment of a new r gime with regard to the press a r gime under which the capitalist owners of printing presses and of paper cannot be the all powerful and exclusive manufacturers of public opinion   we must further proceed to the confiscation of private printing plants and supplies of paper  which should become the property of the soviets  both in the capital and in the provinces  so that the political parties and groups can make use of the facilities of printing in proportion to the actual strength of the ideas they represent in other words  proportionally to the number of their constituents   the re stablishment of the so called  freedom of the press   the simple return of printing presses and paper to the capitalists  poisoners of the mind of the people this would be an inadmissible surrender to the will of capital  a giving up of one of the most important conquests of the revolution  in other words  it would be a measure of unquestionably counter revolutionary character   proceeding from the above  the  tsay ee kah  categorically rejects all propositions aiming at the re stablishment of the old r gime in the domain of the press  and unequivocally supports the point of view of the council of people s commissars on this question  against pretentions and ultimatums dictated by petty bourgeois prejudices  or by evident surrender to the interests of the counter revolutionary bourgeoisie   the reading of this resolution was interrupted by ironical shouts from the left socialist revolutionaries  and bursts of indignation from the insurgent bolsheviki  karelin was on his feet  protesting   three weeks ago the bolsheviki were the most ardent defenders of the freedom of the press    the arguments in this resolution suggest singularly the point of view of the old black hundreds and the censors of the tsarist r gime for they also talked of  poisoners of the mind of the people     trotzky spoke at length in favour of the resolution  he distinguished between the press during the civil war  and the press after the victory   during civil war the right to use violence belongs only to the oppressed       cries of  who s the oppressed now  cannibal       the victory over our adversaries is not yet achieved  and the newspapers are arms in their hands  in these conditions  the closing of the newspapers is a legitimate measure of defence      then passing to the question of the press after the victory  trotzky continued    the attitude of socialists on the question of freedom of the press should be the same as their attitude toward the freedom of business     the rule of the democracy which is being established in russia demands that the domination of the press by private property must be abolished  just as the domination of industry by private property     the power of the soviets should confiscate all printing plants    cries   confiscate the printing shop of  pravda       the monopoly of the press by the bourgeoisie must be abolished  otherwise it isn t worth while for us to take the power  each group of citizens should have access to print shops and paper     the ownership of print type and of paper belongs first to the workers and peasants  and only afterwards to the bourgeois parties  which are in a minority     the passing of the power into the hands of the soviets will bring about a radical transformation of the essential conditions of existence  and this transformation will necessarily be evident in the press     if we are going to nationalise the banks  can we then tolerate the financial journals  the old r gime must die  that must be understood once and for all      applause and angry cries   karelin declared that the  tsay ee kah  had no right to pass upon this important question  which should be left to a special committee  again  passionately  he demanded that the press be free   then lenin  calm  unemotional  his forehead wrinkled  as he spoke slowly  choosing his words  each sentence falling like a hammer blow   the civil war is not yet finished  the enemy is still with us  consequently it is impossible to abolish the measures of repression against the press    we bolsheviki have always said that when we reached a position of power we would close the bourgeois press  to tolerate the bourgeois newspapers would mean to cease being a socialist  when one makes a revolution  one cannot mark time  one must always go forward or go back  he who now talks about the  freedom of the press  goes backward  and halts our headlong course toward socialism    we have thrown off the yoke of capitalism  just as the first revolution threw off the yoke of tsarism   if the first revolution had the right to suppress the monarchist papers   then we have the right to suppress the bourgeois press  it is impossible to separate the question of the freedom of the press from the other questions of the class struggle  we have promised to close these newspapers  and we shall do it  the immense majority of the people is with us    now that the insurrection is over  we have absolutely no desire to suppress the papers of the other socialist parties  except inasmuch as they appeal to armed insurrection  or to disobedience to the soviet government  however  we shall not permit them  under the pretence of freedom of the socialist press  to obtain  through the secret support of the bourgeoisie  a monopoly of printing presses  ink and paper     these essentials must become the property of the soviet government  and be apportioned  first of all  to the socialist parties in strict proportion to their voting strength       then the vote  the resolution of larin and the left socialist revolutionaries was defeated by 31 to 22  the lenin motion was carried by 34 to 24  among the minority were the bolsheviki riazanov and lozovsky  who declared that it was impossible for them to vote against any restriction on the freedom of the press   upon this the left socialist revolutionaries declared they could no longer be responsible for what was being done  and withdrew from the military revolutionary committee and all other positions of executive responsibility   five members nogin  rykov  miliutin  teodorovitch and shiapnikov resigned from the council of people s commissars  declaring   we are in favour of a socialist government composed of all the parties in the soviets  we consider that only the creation of such a government can possibly guarantee the results of the heroic struggle of the working class and the revolutionary army  outside of that  there remains only one way  the constitution of a purely bolshevik government by means of political terrorism  this last is the road taken by the council of people s commissars  we cannot and will not follow it  we see that this leads directly to the elimination from political life of many proletarian organisations  to the establishment of an irresponsible r gime  and to the destruction of the revolution and the country  we cannot take the responsibility for such a policy  and we renounce before the  tsay ee kah  our function as people s commissars   other commissars  without resigning their positions  signed the declaration riazanov  derbychev of the press department  arbuzov  of the government printing plant  yureniev  of the red guard  feodorov  of the commissariat of labour  and larin  secretary of the section of elaboration of decrees   at the same time kameniev  rykov  miliutin  zinoviev and nogin resigned from the central committee of the bolshevik party  making public their reasons       the constitution of such a government  composed of all the parties of the soviet  is indispensable to prevent a new flow of blood  the coming famine  the destruction of the revolution by the kaledinists  to assure the convocation of the constituent assembly at the proper time  and to apply effectively the programme adopted by the congress of soviets      we cannot accept the responsibility for the disastrous policy of the central committee  carried on against the will of an enormous majority of the proletariat and the soldiers  who are eager to see the rapid end of the bloodshed between the different political parties of the democracy     we renounce our title as members of the central committee  in order to be able to say openly our opinion to the masses of workers and soldiers      we leave the central committee at the moment of victory  we cannot calmly look on while the policy of the chiefs of the central committee leads toward the loss of the fruits of victory and the crushing of the proletariat      the masses of the workers  the soldiers of the garrison  stirred restlessly  sending their delegations to smolny  to the conference for formation of the new government  where the break in the ranks of the bolsheviki caused the liveliest joy   but the answer of the leninites was swift and ruthless  shliapnikov and teodorovitch submitted to party discipline and returned to their posts  kameniev was stripped of his powers as president of the  tsay ee kah   and sverdlov elected in his place  zinoviev was deposed as president of the petrograd soviet  on the morning of the 5th   pravda  contained a ferocious proclamation to the people of russia  written by lenin  which was printed in hundreds of thousands of copies  posted on the walls everywhere  and distributed over the face of russia   the second all russian congress of soviets gave the majority to the bolshevik party  only a government formed by this party can therefore be a soviet government  and it is known to all that the central committee of the bolshevik party  a few hours before the formation of the new government and before proposing the list of its members to the all russian congress of soviets  invited to its meeting three of the most eminent members of the left socialist revolutionary group  comrades kamkov  spiro and karelin  and asked them to participate in the new government  we regret infinitely that the invited comrades refused  we consider their refusal inadmissible for revolutionists and champions of the working class  we are willing at any time to include the left socialist revolutionaries in the government  but we declare that  as the party of the majority at the second all russian congress of soviets  we are entitled and bound before the people to form a government          comrades  several members of the central committee of our party and the council of people s commissars  kameniev  zinoviev  nogin  rykov  miliutin and a few others left yesterday  november 17th  the central committee of our party  and the last three  the council of people s commissars      the comrades who left us acted like deserters  because they not only abandoned the posts entrusted to them  but also disobeyed the direct instructions of the central committee of our party  to the effect that they should await the decisions of the petrograd and moscow party organisations before retiring  we blame decisively such desertion  we are firmly convinced that all conscious workers  soldiers and peasants  belonging to our party or sympathising with it  will also disapprove of the behaviour of the deserters      remember  comrades  that two of these deserters  kameniev and zinoviev  even before the uprising in petrograd  appeared as deserters and strike breakers  by voting at the decisive meeting of the central committee  october 23d  1917  against the insurrection  and even after the resolution passed by the central committee  they continued their campaign at a meeting of the party workers     but the great impulse of the masses  the great heroism of millions of workers  soldiers and peasants  in moscow  petrograd  at the front  in the trenches  in the villages  pushed aside the deserters as a railway train scatters saw dust      shame upon those who are of little faith  hesitate  who doubt  who allow themselves to be frightened by the bourgeoisie  or who succumb before the cries of the latter s direct or indirect accomplices  there is not a shadow of hesitation in the masses of petrograd  moscow  and the rest of russia          we shall not submit to any ultimatums from small groups of intellectuals which are not followed by the masses  which are practically only supported by kornilovists  savinkovists   yunkers   and so forth      the response from the whole country was like a blast of hot storm  the insurgents never got a chance to  say openly their opinion to the masses of workers and soldiers   upon the  tsay ee kah  rolled in like breakers the fierce popular condemnation of the  deserters   for days smolny was thronged with angry delegations and committees  from the front  from the volga  from the petrograd factories   why did they dare leave the government  were they paid by the bourgeoisie to destroy the revolution  they must return and submit to the decisions of the central committee    only in the petrograd garrison was there still uncertainty  a great soldier meeting was held on november 24th  addressed by representatives of all the political parties  by a vast majority lenin s policy was sustained  and the left socialist revolutionaries were told that they must enter the government      see next page    the mensheviki delivered a final ultimatum  demanding that all ministers and  yunkers  be released  that all newspapers be allowed full freedom  that the red guard be disarmed and the garrison put under command of the duma  to this smolny answered that all the socialist ministers and also all but a very few  yunkers  had been already set free  that all newspapers were free except the bourgeois press  and that the soviet would remain in command of the armed forces     on the 19th the conference to form a new government disbanded  and the opposition one by one slipped away to moghilev  where  under the wing of the general staff  they continued to form government after government  until the end

the army all that is necessary  opposition to these measures is a crime against the people  we warn the rich classes and their sympathisers that  if they do not cease their sabotage and their provocation in halting the transportation of food  they will be the first to suffer  they will be deprived of the right of receiving food  all the reserves which they possess will be requisitioned  the property of the principal criminals will be confiscated   we have done our duty in warning those who play with fire   we are convinced that in case decisive measures become necessary  we shall be solidly supported by all workers  soldiers  and peasants   on the 22d of november the walls of the city were placarded with a sheet headed  extraordinary communication    the council of people s

received a crust of bread now for several days  and in two or three days they will not have any more biscuits which are being doled out to them from reserve supplies until now never touched     already delegates from all parts of the front are talking of a necessary removal of part of the army to the rear  foreseeing that in a few days there will be headlong flight of the soldiers  dying from hunger  ravaged by the three years  war in the trenches  sick  insufficiently clothed  bare footed  driven mad by superhuman misery    the military revolutionary committee brings this to the notice of the petrograd garrison and the workers of petrograd  the situation at the front demands the most urgent and decisive measures      meanwhile the higher functionaries of the government institutions  banks  railroads  post and telegraph  are on strike and impeding the work of the government in supplying the front with provisions     each hour of delay may cost the life of thousands of soldiers  the counter revolutionary functionaries are the most dishonest criminals toward their hungry and dying brethren on the front      the military revolutionary committee gives these criminals a last warning  in event of the least resistance or opposition on their part  the harshness of the measures which will be adopted against them will correspond to the seriousness of their crime                                      the masses of workers and soldiers responded by a savage tremor of rage  which swept all russia  in the capital the government and bank employees got out hundreds of proclamations and appeals  see app  xi  sect  14   protesting  defending themselves  such as this one   to the attention of all citizens   the state bank is closed   why   because the violence exercised by the bolsheviki against the state bank has made it impossible for us to work  the first act of the people s commissars was to demand ten million rubles  and on november 27th they demanded twenty five millions  without any indication as to where this money was to go       we functionaries cannot take part in plundering the people s property  we stopped work   citizens  the money in the state bank is yours  the people s money  acquired by your labour  your sweat and blood  citizens  save the people s property from robbery  and us from violence  and we shall immediately

impossible for the employees to work  appeals to the population to support them against smolny     but the dominant worker and soldier did not believe them  it was firmly fixed in the popular mind that the employees were sabotaging  starving the army  starving the people     in the long bread lines  which as formerly stood in the iron winter streets  it was not  the government  which was blamed  as it had been under kerensky  but the  tchinovniki   the sabotageurs  for the government was  their  government   their  soviets and the functionaries of the ministries were against it      at the centre of all this opposition was the duma  and its militant organ  the committee for salvation  protesting against all the decrees of the council of people s commissars  voting again and again not to recognise the soviet government  openly cooperating with the new counter revolutionary  governments  set up at moghilev     on the 17th of november  for example  the committee for salvation addressed  all municipal governments  zemstvos  and all democratic and revolutionary organisations of peasants  workers  soldiers and other citizens   in these words   do not recognise the government of the bolsheviki  and struggle against it   form local committees for salvation of country and revolution  who will unite all democratic forces  so as to aid the all russian committee for salvation in the tasks which it has set itself      meanwhile the elections for the constituent assembly in petrograd  see app  xi  sect  15  gave an enormous plurality to the bolsheviki  so that even the mensheviki internationalists pointed out that the duma ought to be re elected  as it no longer represented the political composition of the petrograd population     at the same time floods of resolutions from workers  organisations  from military units  even from the peasants in the surrounding country  poured in upon the duma  calling it  counter revolutionary  kornilovitz   and demanding that it resign  the last days of the duma were stormy with the bitter demands of the municipal workers for decent living wages  and the threat of strikes      on the 23d a formal decree of the military revolutionary committee dissolved the committee for salvation  on the 29th  the council of people s commissars ordered the dissolution and re election of the petrograd city duma   in view of the fact that the central duma of petrograd  elected september 2d      has definitely lost the right to represent the population of petrograd  being in complete disaccord with its state of mind and its aspirations     and in view of the fact that the personnel of the duma majority  although having lost all political following  continues to make use of its prerogatives to resist in a counter revolutionary manner the will of the workers  soldiers and peasants  to sabotage and obstruct the normal work of the government the council of people s commissars considers it its duty to invite the population of the capital to pronounce judgment on the policy of the organ of municipal autonomy   to this end the council of people s commissars resolves    1  to dissolve the municipal duma  the dissolution to take effect november 30th  1917    2  all functionaries elected or appointed by the present duma shall remain at their posts and fulfil the duties confided to them  until their places shall be filled by representatives of the new duma    3  all municipal employees shall continue to fulfil their duties  those who leave the service of their own accord shall be considered discharged    4  the new elections for the municipal duma of petrograd are fixed for december 9th  1917       5  the municipal duma of petrograd shall meet december 11th  1917  at two o clock    6  those who disobey this decree  as well as those who intentionally harm or destroy the property of the municipality  shall be immediately arrested and brought before the revolutionary tribunals      the duma met defiantly  passing resolutions to the effect that it would  defend its position to the last drop of its blood   and appealing desperately to the population to save their  own elected city government   but the population remained indifferent or hostile  on the 31st mayor schreider and several members were arrested  interrogated  and released  that day and the next the duma continued to meet  interrupted frequently by red guards and sailors  who politely requested the assembly to disperse  at the meeting of december 2d  an officer and some sailors entered the nicolai hall while a member was speaking  and ordered the members to leave  or force would be used  they did so  protesting to the last  but finally  ceding to violence    the new duma  which was elected ten days later  and for which the  moderate  socialists refused to vote  was almost entirely bolshevik      there remained several centres of dangerous opposition  such as the  republics  of ukraine and finland  which were showing definitely anti soviet tendencies  both at helsingfors and at kiev the governments were gathering troops which could be depended upon  and entering upon campaigns of crushing bolshevism  and of disarming and expelling russian troops  the ukrainean rada had taken command of all southern russia  and was furnishing kaledin reinforcements and supplies  both finland and ukraine were beginning secret negotiations with the germans  and were promptly recognised by the allied governments  which loaned them huge sums of money  joining with the propertied classes to create counter revolutionary centres of attack upon soviet russia  in the end  when bolshevism had conquered in both these countries  the defeated bourgeoisie called in the germans to restore them to power      but the most

not intend to divide the cossack lands among the peasants of great russia   no   answered trotzky  the cossacks deliberated for a while   well   they asked   does the soviet government intend to confiscate the estates of our great cossack land owners and divide them among the working cossacks   to this lenin replied   that   he said   is for  you  to do  we shall support the working cossacks in all their actions     the best way to begin is to form cossacks soviets  you will be given representation in the  tsay ee kah   and then it will be  your  government  too      the cossacks departed

   only over my dead body   responded kaledin  a month later  seeing his army melt away before his eyes  kaledin blew out his brains  and the cossack movement was no more      meanwhile at moghilev were gathered the old  tsay ee kah  the  moderate  socialist leaders from avksentiev to tchernov the active chiefs of the old army committees  and the reactionary officers  the staff steadily refused to recognise the council of people s commissars  it had united about it the death battalions  the knights of st  george  and the cossacks of the front  and was in close and secret touch with the allied military attach s  and with the kaledin movement and the ukrainean rada      the allied governments had made no reply to the peace decree of november 8th  in which the congress of soviets had

lenin  the direction of foreign affairs has been entrusted to me  people s commissar for foreign affairs      in drawing your attention to the text  approved by the all russian congress  of the proposition for an armistice and a democratic peace without annexations or indemnities  based on the right of self determination of peoples  i have the honour to request you to consider that document as a formal proposal of an immediate armistice on all fronts  and the opening of immediate peace negotiations  a proposal which the authorised government of the russian republic addresses at the same time to all the belligerent peoples and their governments   please accept  mr  ambassador  the profound assurance of the esteem of the soviet government toward your people  who cannot but wish for peace  like all the other peoples exhausted and drained by this unexampled butchery      the same night the council of people s commissars telegraphed to general dukhonin       the council of people s commissars considers it indispensable without delay to make a formal proposal of armistice to all the powers  both enemy and allied  a declaration conforming to this decision has been sent by the commissar for foreign affairs to the representatives of the allied powers at petrograd   the council of people s commissars orders you  citizen commander     to propose to the enemy military

1  to inform the council by direct wire immediately of any and all steps in the pourparlers with the representatives of the enemy armies   2  not to sign the act of armistice until it has been passed upon by the council of people s commissars   the allied ambassadors received trotzky s note with contemptuous silence  accompanied by anonymous interviews in the newspapers  full of spite and ridicule  the order to dukhonin was characterised openly as an act of treason      as for dukhonin  he gave no sign  on the night of november 22nd he was communicated with by telephone  and asked if he intended to obey the order  dukhonin answered that he could not  unless it emanated from  a government sustained by the army and the country    by telegraph he was immediately dismissed from the post of supreme commander  and krylenko appointed in his place  following his tactics of appealing to the masses  lenin sent a radio to all regimental  divisional and corps committees  to all soldiers and sailors of the army and the fleet  acquainting them with dukhonin s refusal  and ordering that  the regiments on the front shall elect delegates to begin negotiations with the enemy detachments opposite their positions       on the 23d  the military attaches of the allied nations  acting on instructions from their governments  presented a note to dukhonin  in which he was solemnly warned not to  violate the conditions of the treaties concluded between the powers of the entente   the note went on to say that if a separate armistice with germany were concluded  that act  would result in the most serious consequences  to russia  this communication dukhonin at once sent out to all the soldiers  committees      next morning trotzky made another appeal to the troops  characterising the note of the allied representatives as a flagrant interference in the internal affairs of russia  and a bald attempt  to force by threats the russian army and the russian people to continue the war in execution of the treaties concluded by the tsar       from smolny poured out proclamation after proclamation   see app  xi  sect  19  denouncing dukhonin and the counter revolutionary officers about

accompanied by three detachments of fanatical sailors  set out for the  stavka   breathing threats of vengeance   see app  xi  sect  20  and received by the soldiers everywhere with tremendous ovations a triumphal progress  the central army committee issued a declaration in favour of dukhonin  and at once ten thousand troops moved upon moghilev      on december 2d the garrison of moghilev rose and seized the city  arresting dukhonin and the army committee  and going out with victorious red banners to meet the new supreme commander  krylenko entered moghilev next morning  to find a howling mob gathered about the railway car in which dukhonin had been imprisoned  krylenko made a speech in which he implored the soldiers not to harm dukhonin  as he was to be taken to petrograd and judged by the revolutionary tribunal  when he had finished  suddenly dukhonin himself appeared at the window  as if to address the throng  but with a savage roar the people rushed the car  and falling upon the old general  dragged him out and beat him to death on the platform      so ended the revolt of the  stavka       immensely strengthened by the collapse of the last important stronghold of hostile military power in russia  the soviet government began with confidence the organisation of the state  many of the old functionaries flocked to its banner  and many members of other parties entered the government service  the financially ambitious  however  were checked by the decree on salaries of government employees  fixing the salaries of the people s commissars the highest at five hundred rubles  about fifty dollars  a month     the strike of government employees  led by the union of unions  collapsed  deserted by the financial and commercial interests which had been backing it  the bank clerks returned to their jobs      with the decree on the nationalisation of banks  the formation of the supreme council of people s economy  the putting into practical operation of the land decree in the villages  the democratic reorganisation of the army  and the sweeping changes in all branches of the government and of life  with all these  effective only by the will of the masses of workers  soldiers and peasants  slowly began  with many mistakes and hitches  the moulding of proletarian russia   not by compromise with the propertied classes  or with the other political leaders  not by conciliating the old government mechanism  did the bolsheviki conquer the power  nor by the organized violence of a small clique  if the masses all over russia had not been ready for insurrection it must have failed  the only reason for bolshevik success lay in their accomplishing the vast and simple desires of the most profound strata of the people  calling them to the work of tearing down and destroying the old  and afterward  in the smoke of falling ruins  cooperating with them to erect the frame work of the new                                    chapter xii                          the peasants  congress  it was on november 18th that the snow came  in the morning we woke to window ledges heaped white  and snowflakes falling so whirling thick that it was impossible to see ten feet ahead  the mud was gone  in a twinkling the gloomy city became white  dazzling  the  droshki  with their padded coachmen turned into sleights  bounding along the uneven street at headlong speed  their drivers  beards stiff and frozen     in spite of revolution  all russia plunging dizzily into the unknown and terrible future  joy swept the city with the coming of the snow  everybody was smiling  people ran into the streets  holding out their arms to the soft  falling flakes  laughing  hidden was all the greyness  only the gold and coloured spires and cupolas  with heightened barbaric splendour  gleamed through the white snow   even the sun came out  pale and watery  at noon  the colds and rheumatism of the rainy months vanished  the life of the city grew gay  and the very revolution ran swifter      i sat one evening in a  traktir  a kind of lower class inn across the street from the gates of smolny  a low ceilinged  loud place called  uncle tom s cabin   much frequented by red guards  they crowded it now  packed close around the little tables with their dirty table cloths and enormous china tea pots  filling the place with foul cigarette smoke  while the harassed waiters ran about crying   seichass  seichass   in a minute  right away    in one corner sat a man in the uniform of a captain  addressing the assembly  which interrupted him at every few words    you are no better than murderers   he cried   shooting down your russian brothers on the streets     when did we do that   asked a worker    last sunday you did it  when the  yunkers       well  didn t they shoot us   one man exhibited his arm in a sling   haven t i got something to remember them by  the devils    the captain shouted at the top of his voice   you should remain neutral  you should remain neutral  who are you to destroy the legal government  who is lenin  a german      who are you  a counter revolutionist  a provocator   they bellowed at him   when he could make himself heard the captain stood up   all right   said he   you call yourselves the people of russia  but you re  not  the people of russia  the  peasants  are the people of russia  wait until the peasants      yes   they cried   wait until the peasants speak  we know what the peasants will say     aren t they workingmen like ourselves    in the long run  everything depended upon the peasants  while the peasants had been politically backward  still they had their own peculiar ideas  and they constituted more than eighty per cent of the people of russia  the bolsheviki had a comparatively small following among the peasants  and a permanent dictatorship of russia by the industrial workers was impossible     the traditional peasant party was the socialist revolutionary party  of all the parties now supporting the soviet government  the left socialist revolutionaries were the logical inheritors of peasant leadership and the left socialist revolutionaries  who were at the mercy of the organised city proletariat  desperately needed the backing of the peasants      meanwhile smolny had not neglected the peasants  after the land decree  one of the first actions of the new  tsay ee kah  had been to call a congress of peasants  over the head of the executive committee of the peasants  soviets  a few days later was issued detailed regulations for the  volost   township  land committees  followed by lenin s  instruction to peasants    see app  xii  sect  1  which explained the bolshevik revolution and the new government in simple terms  and on november 16th  lenin and miliutin published the  instructions to provincial emissaries   of whom thousands were sent by the soviet government into the villages   1  upon his arrival in the province to which he is accredited  the emissary should call a joint meeting of the central executive committees of the soviets of workers   soldiers  and peasants  deputies  to whom he should make a report on the agrarian laws  and then demand that a joint plenary session of the soviets be summoned      2  he must study the aspects of the agrarian problem in the province   a  has the land owners  property been taken over  and if so  in what districts   b  who administers the confiscated land the former proprietor  or the land committees   c  what has been done with the agricultural machinery and with the farm animals   3  has the ground cultivated by the peasants been augmented   4  how much and in what respect does the amount of land now under cultivation differ from the amount fixed by the government as an average minimum   5  the emissary must insist that  after the peasants have received the land  it is imperative that they increase the amount of cultivated land as quickly as possible  and that they hasten the sending of grain to the cities  as the only means of avoiding famine   6  what are the measures projected or put into effect for the transfer of land from the land owners to the land committees and similar bodies appointed by the soviets   7  it is desirable that agricultural properties well appointed and well organised should be administered by soviets composed of the regular employees of those properties  under the direction of competent agricultural scientists   all through the villages a ferment of change was going on  caused not only by the electrifying action of the land decree  but also by thousands of revolutionary minded peasant soldiers returning from the front     these men  especially  welcomed the call to a congress of peasants   like the old  tsay ee kah  in the matter of the second congress of workers  and soldiers  soviets  the executive committee tried to prevent the peasant congress summoned by smolny  and like the old  tsay ee kah   finding its resistance futile  the executive committee sent frantic telegrams ordering the election of conservative delegates  word was even spread among the peasants that the congress would meet at moghilev  and some delegates went there  but by november 23d about four hundred had gathered in petrograd  and the party caucuses had begun      the first session took place in the alexander hall of the duma building  and the first vote showed that more than half of all the delegates were left socialist revolutionaries  while the bolsheviki controlled a bare fifth  the conservative socialist revolutionaries a quarter  and all the rest were united only in their opposition to the old executive committee  dominated by avksentiev  tchaikovsky and peshekhonov      the great hall was jammed with people and shaken with continual clamour  deep  stubborn bitterness divided the delegates into angry groups  to the right was a sprinkling of officers  epaulettes  and the patriarchal  bearded faces of the older  more substantial peasants  in the centre were a few peasants  non commissioned officers  and some soldiers  and on the left almost all the delegates wore the uniforms of common soldiers  these last were the young generation  who had been serving in the army     the galleries were thronged with workers who  in russia  still remember their peasant origin      unlike the old  tsay ee kah   the executive committee  in opening the session  did not recognise the congress as official  the official congress was called for december 13th  amid a hurricane of applause and angry cries  the speaker declared that this gathering was merely  extraordinary conference     but the  extraordinary conference  soon showed its attitude toward the executive committee by electing as presiding officer maria spiridonova  leader of the left socialist revolution aries   most of the first day was taken up by a violent debate as to whether the representatives of  volost  soviets should be seated  or only delegates from the provincial bodies  and just as in the workers  and soldiers  congress  an overwhelming majority declared in favour of the widest possible representation  whereupon the old executive committee left the hall      almost immediately it was evident that most of the delegates were hostile to the government of the people s commissars  zinoviev  attempting to speak for the bolsheviki  was hooted down  and as he left the platform  amid laughter  there were cries   there s how a people s commissar sits in a mudpuddle     we left socialist revolutionaries refuse   cried nazariev  a delegate from the provinces   to recognise this so called workers  and peasants  government until the peasants are represented in it  at present it is nothing but a dictatorship of the workers     we insist upon the formation of a new government which will represent the entire democracy    the reactionary delegates shrewdly fostered this feeling  declaring  in the face of protests from the bolshevik benches  that the council of people s commissars intended either to control the congress or dissolve it by force of arms an announcement which was received by the peasants with bursts of fury      on the third day lenin suddenly mounted the tribune  for ten minutes the room went mad   down with him   they shrieked   we will not listen to any of your people s commissars  we don t recognise your government    lenin stood there quite calmly  gripping the desk with both hands  his little eyes thoughtfully surveying the tumult beneath  finally  except for the right side of the hall  the demonstration wore itself out somewhat    i do not come here as a member of the council of people s commissars   said lenin  and waited again for the noise to subside   but as a member of the bolshevik faction  duly elected to this congress   and he held his credentials up to that all might see them    however   he went on  in an unmoved voice   nobody will deny that the present government of russia has been formed by the bolshevik party   he had to wait a moment   so that for all purposes it is the same thing      here the right benches broke into deafening clamour  but the centre and left were curious  and compelled silence   lenin s argument was simple   tell me frankly  you peasants  to whom we have given the lands of the  pomieshtchiki   do you want now to prevent the workers from getting control of industry  this is class war  the  pomieshtchiki  of course oppose the peasants  and the manufactures oppose the workers  are you going to allow the ranks of the proletariat to be divided  which side will you be on    we  the bolsheviki  are the party of the proletariat of the peasant proletariat as well as the industrial proletariat  we  the bolsheviki  are the protectors of the soviets of the peasants  soviets as well as those of the workers and soldiers  the present government is a government of soviets  we have not only invited the peasants  soviets to join that government  but we have also invited representatives of the left socialist revolutionaries to enter the council of people s commissars       the soviets are the most perfect representatives of the people of the workers in the factories and mines  of the workers in the fields  anybody who attempts to destroy the soviets is guilty of an anti democratic and counter revolutionary act  and i serve notice here on you  comrades  right  socialist revolutionaries and on you  messrs  cadets that if the constituent assembly attempts to destroy the soviets  we shall not permit the constituent assembly to do this thing    on the afternoon of november 25th tchernov arrived in hot haste from moghilev  summoned by the executive committee  only two months before considered an extreme revolutionist  and very popular with the peasants  he was now called to check the dangerous drift of the congress toward the left  upon his arrival tchernov was arrested and taken to smolny  where  after a short conversation  he was released   his first act was to bitterly rebuke the executive committee for leaving the congress  they agreed to return  and tchernov entered the hall  welcomed with great applause by the majority  and the hoots and jeers of the bolsheviki    comrades  i have been away  i participated in the conference of the twelfth army on the question of calling a congress of all the peasant delegates of the armies of the western front  and i know very little about the insurrection which occurred here     zinoviev rose in his seat  and shouted   yes  you were away for a few minutes   fearful tumult  cries   down with the bolsheviki    tchernov continued   the accusation that i helped lead an army on petrograd has no foundation  and is entirely false  where does such an accusation come from  show me the source    zinoviev    izviestia  and  dielo naroda  your own paper  that s where it comes from    tchernov s wide face  with the small eyes  waving hair and greyish beard  became red with wrath  but he controlled himself and went on   i repeat  i know practically nothing about what has happened here  and i did not lead any army except this army   he pointed to the peasant delegates   which i am largely responsible for bringing here   laughter  and shouts of  bravo     upon my return i visited smolny  no such accusation was made against me there     after a brief conversation i left and that s all  let any one present make such an accusation    an uproar followed  in which the bolsheviki and some of the left socialist revolutionaries were on their feet all at once  shaking their fists and yelling  and the rest of the assembly tried to yell them down    this is an outrage  not a session   cried tchernov  and he left the hall  the meeting was adjourned because of the noise and disorder      meanwhile  the question of the status of the executive committee was agitating all minds  by declaring the assembly  extraordinary conference   it had been planned to block the reelection of the executive committee  but this worked both ways  the left socialist revolutionists decided that if the congress had no power over the executive committee  then the executive committee had no power over the congress  on november 25th the assembly resolved that the powers of the executive committee be assumed by the extraordinary conference  in which only members of the executive who had been elected as delegates might vote      the next day  in spite of the bitter opposition of the bolsheviki  the resolution was amended to give all the members of the executive committee  whether elected as delegates or not  voice and vote in the assembly   on the 27th occurred the debate on the land question  which revealed the differences between the agrarian programme of the bolsheviki and the left socialist revolutionaries   kolchinsky  for the left socialist revolutionaries  outlined the history of the land question during the revolution  the first congress of peasants  soviets  he said  had voted a precise and formal resolution in favour of putting the landed estates immediately into the hands of the land committees  but the directors of the revolution  and the bourgeois in the government  had insisted that the question could not be solved until the constituent assembly met     the second period of the revolution  the period of  compromise  was signalled by the entrance of tchernov into the cabinet  the peasants were convinced that now the practical solution of the land question would begin  but in spite of the imperative decision of the first peasant congress  the reactionaries and conciliators in the executive committee had prevented any action  this policy provoked a series of agrarian disorders  which appeared as the natural expression of impatience and thwarted energy on the part of the peasants  the peasants understood the exact meaning of the revolution they tried to turn words into action       the recent events   said the orator   do not indicate a simple riot  or a  bolshevik adventure   but on the contrary  a real popular rising  which has been greeted with sympathy by the whole country       the bolsheviki in general took the correct attitude toward the land question  but in recommending that the peasants seize the land by force  they committed a profound error     from the first days  the bolsheviki declared that the peasants should take over the land  by revolutionary massaction   this is nothing but anarchy  the land can be taken over in an organised manner     for the bolsheviki it was important that the problems of the revolution should be solved in the quickest possible manner but the bolsheviki were not interested in  how  these problems were to be solved       the land decree of the congress of soviets is identical in its fundamentals with the decisions of the first peasants  congress  why then did not the new government follow the tactics outlined by that congress  because the council of people s commissars wanted to hasten the settlement of the land question  so that the constituent assembly would have nothing to do       but also the government saw that it was necessary to adopt practical measures  so without further reflection  it adopted the regulations for land committees  thus creating a strange situation  for the council of people s commissars abolished private property in land  but the regulations drawn up by the land committees are based on private property     however  no harm has been done by that  for the land committees are paying no attention to the soviet decrees  but are putting into operation their own practical decisions decisions based on the will of the vast majority of the peasants       these land committees are not attempting the legislative solution of the land question  which belongs to the constituent assembly alone     but will the constituent assembly desire to do the will of the russian peasants  of that we cannot be sure     all we can be sure of is that the revolutionary determination of the peasants is now aroused  and that the constituent will be  forced  to settle the land question the way the peasants want it settled     the constituent assembly will not dare to break with the will of the people       followed him lenin  listened to now with absorbing intensity   at this moment we are not only trying to solve the land question  but the question of social revolution not only here in russia  but all over the world  the land question cannot be solved independently of the other problems of the social revolution     for example  the confiscation of the landed estates will provoke the resistance not only of russian land owners  but also of foreign capital with whom the great landed properties are connected through the intermediary of the banks       the ownership of the land in russia is the basis for immense oppression  and the confiscation of the land by the peasants is the most important step of our revolution  but it cannot be separated from the other steps  as is clearly manifested by the stages through which the revolution has had to pass  the first stage was the crushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of the industrial capitalists and land owners  whose interests are closely related  the second stage was the strengthening of the soviets and the political compromise with the bourgeoisie  the mistake of the left socialist revolutionaries lies in the fact that at that time they did not oppose the policy of compromise  because they held the theory that the consciousness of the masses was not yet fully developed        if socialism can only be realised when the intellectual development of all the people permits it  then we shall not see socialism for at least five hundred years      the socialist political party this is the vanguard of the working class  it must not allow itself to be halted by the lack of education of the mass average  but it must lead the masses  using the soviets as organs of revolutionary initiative     but in order to lead the wavering  the comrades left socialist revolutionaries themselves must stop hesitating       in july last a series of open breaks began between the popular masses and the  compromisers   but now  in november  the left socialist revolutionaries are still holding out their hand to avksentiev  who is pulling the people with his little finger     if compromise continues  the revolution disappears  no compromise with the bourgeoisie is possible  its power must be absolutely crushed       we bolsheviki have not changed our land programme  we have not given up the abolition of private property in the land  and we do not intend to do so  we adopted the regulations for land committees  which are  not  based on private property at all because we want to accomplish the popular will in the way the people have themselves decided to do it  so as to draw closer the coalition of all the elements who are fighting for the social revolution    we invite the left socialist revolutionaries to enter that coalition  insisting  however  that they cease looking backward  and that they break with the  conciliators  of their party       as far as the constituent assembly is concerned  it is true  as the preceding speaker has said  that the work of the constituent will depend on the revolutionary determination of the masses  i say   count on that revolutionary determination  but don t forget your gun     lenin then read the bolshevik resolution   the peasants  congress  fully supporting the land decree of november 8th    approves of the provisional workers  and peasants  government of the russian republic  established by the second all russian congress of soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies   the peasants  congress    invites all peasants unanimously to sustain that law  and to apply it immediately themselves  and at the same time invites the peasants to appoint to posts and positions of responsibility only persons who have proved  not by words but by acts  their entire devotion to the interests of the exploited peasant workers  their desire and their ability to defend these interests against all resistance on the part of the great land owners  the capitalists  their partisans and accomplices      the peasants  congress  at the same time  expresses its conviction that the complete realisation of all the measures which make up the land decree can only be successful through the triumph of the workers  social revolution  which began november 7th  1917  for only the social revolution can accomplish the definite transfer  without possibility of return  of the land to the peasant workers  the confiscation of model farms and their surrender to the peasant communes  the confiscation of agricultural machinery belonging to the great land owners  the safe guarding of the interests of the agricultural workers by the complete abolition of wage slavery  the regular and methodical distribution among all regions of russia of the products of agriculture and industry  and the seizure of the banks  without which the possession of land by the whole people would be impossible  after the abolition of private property   and all sorts of assistance by the state to the workers      for these reasons the peasants  congress sustains entirely the revolution of november 7th    as a social revolution  and expresses its unalterable will to put into operation  with whatever modifications are necessary  but without any hesitation  the social transformation of the russian republic   the indispensable conditions of the victory of the social revolution  which alone will secure the lasting success and the complete realisation of the land decree  is the close union of the peasant workers with the industrial working class  with the proletariat of all advanced countries  from now on  in the russian republic  all the organisation and administration of the state  from top to bottom  must rest on that union  that union  crushing all attempts  direct or indirect  open or dissimulated  to return to the policy of conciliation with the bourgeoisie conciliation  damned by experience  with the chiefs of bourgeois politics can alone insure the victory of socialism throughout the world      the reactionaries of the executive committee no longer dared openly to appear  tchernov  however  spoke several times  with a modest and winning impartiality  he was invited to sit on the platform     on the second night of the congress an anonymous note was handed up to the chairman  requesting that tchernov be made honorary president  ustinov read the note aloud  and immediately zinoviev was on his feet  screaming that this was a trick of the old executive committee to capture the convention  in a moment the hall was one bellowing mass of waving arms and angry faces  on both sides     nevertheless  tchernov remained very popular   in the stormy debates on the land question and the lenin resolution  the bolsheviki were twice on the point of quitting the assembly  both times restrained by their leaders     it seemed to me as if the congress were hopelessly deadlocked   but none of us knew that a series of secret conferences were already going on between the left socialist revolutionaries and the bolsheviki at smolny  at first the left socialist revolutionaries had demanded that there be a government composed of all the socialist parties in and out of the soviets  to be responsible to a people s council  composed of an equal number of delegates from the workers  and soldiers  organisation  and that of the peasants  and completed by representatives of the city dumas and the zemstvos  lenin and trotzky were to be eliminated  and the military revolutionary committee and other repressive organs dissolved   wednesday morning  november 28th  after a terrible all night struggle  an agreement was reached  the  tsay ee kah  composed of 108 members  was to be augumented by 108 members elected proportionally from the peasants  congress  by 100 delegates elected directly from the army and the fleet  and by 50 representatives of the trade unions  35 from the general unions  10 railway workers  and 5 from the post and telegraph workers   the dumas and zemstvos were dropped  lenin and trotzky remained in the government  and the military revolutionary committee continued to function   the sessions of the congress had now been removed to the imperial law school building  fontanka 6  headquarters of the peasants  soviets  there in the great meeting hall the delegates gathered on wednesday afternoon  the old executive committee had withdrawn  and was holding a rump convention of its own in another room of the same building  made up of bolting delegates and representatives of the army committees   tchernov went from one meeting to the other  keeping a watchful eye on the proceedings  he knew that an agreement with the bolsheviki was being discussed  but he did not know that it had been concluded   he spoke to the rump convention   at present  when everybody is in favour of forming an all socialist government  many people forget the first ministry  which was  not  a coalition government  and in which there was only one socialist kerensky  a government which  in its time  was very popular  now people accuse kerensky  they forget that he was raised to power  not only by the soviets  but also by the popular masses       why did public opinion change toward kerensky  the savages set up gods to which they pray  and which they punish if one of their prayers is not answered     that is what is happening at this moment     yesterday kerensky  today lenin and trotzky  another to morrow       we have proposed to both kerensky and the bolsheviki to retire from the power  kerensky has accepted to day he announced from his hiding place that he has resigned as premier  but the bolsheviki wish to retain the power  and they do not know how to use it       if the bolsheviki succeed  or if they fail  the fate of russia will not be changed  the russian villages understand perfectly what they want  and they are now carrying out their own measures     the villages will save us in the end       in the meanwhile  in the great hall ustinov had announced the agreement between the peasants  congress and smolny  received by the delegates with the wildest joy  suddenly tchernov appeared  and demanded the floor    i understand   he began   that an agreement is being concluded between the peasants  congress and smolny  such an agreement would be illegal  seeing that the true congress of peasants  soviets does not meet until next week       moreover  i want to warn you now that the bolsheviki will never accept your demands       he was interrupted by a great burst of laughter  and realising the situation  he left the platform and the room  taking his popularity with him      late in the afternoon of thursday  november 16th  the congress met in extraordinary session  there was a holiday feeling in the air  on every face was a smile     the remainder of the business before the assembly was hurried through  and then old nathanson  the white bearded dean of the left wing of the socialist revolutionaries  his voice trembling and tears in his eyes  read the report of the  wedding  of the peasants  soviets with the workers  and soldiers  soviets  at every mention of the word  union  there was ecstatic applause     at the end ustinov announced the arrival rival of a delegation from smolny  accompanied by representatives of the red army  greeted with a rising ovation  one after another a workman  a soldier and a sailor took the floor  hailing them   then boris reinstein  delegate of the american socialist labor party   the day of the union of the congress of peasants and the soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies is one of the great days of the revolution  the sound of it will ring with resounding echoes throughout the whole world in paris  in london  and across the ocean in new york  this union will fill with happiness the hearts of all toilers    a great idea has triumphed  the west  and america  expected from russia  from the russian proletariat  something tremendous     the proletariat of the world is waiting for the russian revolution  waiting for the great things that it is accomplishing       sverdlov  president of the  tsay ee kah   greeted them  and with the shout   long live the end of civil war  long live the united democracy   the peasants poured out of the building   it was already dark  and on the ice covered snow glittered the pale light of moon and star  along the bank of the canal were drawn up in full marching order the soldiers of the pavlovsky regiment  with their band  which broke into the  marseillaise   amid the crashing full throated shouts of the soldiers  the peasants formed in line  unfurling the great red banner of the executive committee of the all russian peasants  soviets  embroidered newly in gold   long live the union of the revolutionary and toiling masses   following were other banners  of the district soviets of putilov factory  which read   we bow to this flag in order to create the brotherhood of all people    from somewhere torches appeared  blazing orange in the night  a thousand times reflected in the facets of the ice  streaming out smokily over the throng as it moved down the bank of the fontanka singing  between crowds that stood in astonished silence    long live the revolutionary army  long live the red guard  long live the peasants    so the great procession wound through the city  growing and unfurling ever new red banners lettered in gold  two old peasants  bowed with toil  were walking hand in hand  their faces illumined with child like bliss    well   said one   i d like to see them take away our land again   now    near smolny the red guard was lined up on both sides of the street  wild with delight  the other old peasant spoke to his comrade   i am not tired   he said   i walked on air all the way    on the steps of smolny about a hundred workers  and soldiers  deputies were massed  with their banner  dark against the blaze of light streaming out between the arches  like a wave they rushed down  clasping the peasants in their arms and kissing them  and the procession poured in through the great door and up the stairs  with a noise like thunder      in the immense white meeting room the  tsay ee kah  was waiting  with the whole petrograd soviet and a thousand spectators beside  with that solemnity which attends great conscious moments in history   zinoviev announced the agreement with the peasants  congress  to a shaking roar which rose and burst into storm as the sound of music blared down the corridor  and the head of the procession came in  on the platform the presidium rose and made place for the peasants  presidium  the two embracing  behind them the two banners were intertwined against the white wall  over the empty frame from which the tsar s picture had been torn      then opened the  triumphal session   after a few words of welcome from sverdlov  maria spiridonova  slight  pale  with spectacles and hair drawn flatly down  and the air of a new england school teacher  took the tribune the most loved and the most powerful woman in all russia        before the workers of russia open now horizons which history has never known     all workers  movements in the past have been defeated  but the present movement is international  and that is why it is invincible  there is no force in the world which can put out the fire of the revolution  the old world crumbles down  the new world begins       then trotzky  full of fire   i wish you welcome  comrades peasants  you come here not as guests  but as masters of this house  which holds the heart of the russian revolution  the will of millions of workers is now concentrated in this hall     there is now only one master of the russian land  the union of the workers  soldiers and peasants       with biting sarcasm he went on to speak of the allied diplomats  till then contemptuous of russia s invitation to an armistice  which had been accepted by the central powers    a new humanity will be born of this war     in this hall we swear to workers of all lands to remain at our revolutionary post  if we are broken  then it will be in defending our flag       krylenko followed him  explaining the situation at the front  where dukhonin was preparing to resist the council of people s commissars   let dukhonin and those with him understand well that we shall not deal gently with those who bar the road to peace    dybenko saluted the assembly in the name of the fleet  and krushinsky  member of the  vikzhel   said   from this moment  when the union of all true socialists is realised  the whole army of railway workers places itself absolutely at the disposition of the revolutionary democracy   and lunatcharsky  almost weeping  and proshian  for the left socialist revolutionaries  and finally saharashvili  for the united social democrats internationalists  composed of members of the martov s and of gorky s groups  who declared    we left the  tsay ee kah  because of the uncompromising policy of the bolsheviki  and to force them to make concessions in order to realise the union of all the revolutionary democracy  now that that union is brought about  we consider it a sacred duty to take our places once more in the  tsay ee kah      we declare that all those who have withdrawn from the  tsay ee kah  should now return    stachkov  a dignified old peasant of the presidium of the peasants  congress  bowed to the four corners of the room   i greet you with the christening of a new russian life and freedom    gronsky  in the name of the polish social democracy  skripnik  for the factory shop committees  tifonov  for the russian soldiers at salonika  and others  interminably  speaking out of full hearts  with the happy eloquence of hopes fulfilled     it was late in the night when the following resolution was put and passed unanimously     the  tsay ee kah   united in extraordinary session with the petrograd soviet and the peasants  congress  confirms the land and peace decrees adopted by the second congress of soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies  and also the decree on workers  control adopted by the  tsay ee kah     the joint session of the  tsay ee kah  and the peasants  congress expresses its firm conviction that the union of workers  soldiers and peasants  this fraternal union of all the workers and all exploited  will consolidate the power conquered by them  that it will take all revolutionary measures to hasten the passing of the power into the hands of the working class in other countries  and that it will assure in this manner the lasting accomplishment of a just peace and the victory of socialism   see app  xi  sect  2                           appendix to chapter i                                   1    oborontsi   defenders   all the  moderate

march  1917  these figures  which were published by the ministry of labour as characteristic of conditions all over russia  show that wages did not rise immediately after the revolution  but little by little  on an average  wages increased slightly more than 500 per cent    but at the same time the value of the ruble fell to less than one third its former purchasing power  and the cost of the

the difference  of course  went into the pockets of speculators and merchants   in september  1917  when i arrived in petrograd  the average daily wage of a skilled industrial worker for example  a steel worker in the putilov factory was about 8 rubles  at the same time  profits were enormous   i was told by one of the owners of the thornton woollen mills  an english concern on the outskirts of petrograd  that while wages had increased about 300 per cent in his factory  his profits had gone up  900 per cent                                     3                           the socialist ministers  the history of the efforts of the socialists in the provisional government of july to realise their programme in coalition with the bourgeois ministers  is an illuminating example of class struggle in politics  says lenin  in explanation of this phenomenon    the capitalists    seeing that the position of the government was untenable  resorted to a method which since 1848 has been for decades practised by the capitalists in order to befog  divide  and finally overpower the working class  this method is the so called  coalition ministry   composed of bourgeois and of renegades from the socialist camp    in those countries where political freedom and democracy have existed side by side with the revolutionary movement of the workers for example in england and france the capitalists make use of this subterfuge  and very successfully too  the  socialist  leaders  upon entering the ministries  invariably prove mere figure heads  puppets  simply a shield for the capitalists  a tool with which to defraud the workers  the  democratic  and  republican  capitalists in russia set in motion this very same scheme  the socialist revolutionaries and mensheviki fell victim to it  and on june 1st a  coalition  ministry  with the participation of tchernov  tseretelli  skobeliev  avksentiev  savinkov  zarudny and nikitin became an accomplished fact     problems of

newspaper  said that the provisional government s declaration that russia was a republic constituted a gross abuse of its powers   we cannot admit either a republic  or the present republican government   and we are not sure that we want a republic in russia     october 23d  at a meeting of the cadet party held at riazan  m  dukhonin declared   on march 1st we must establish a constitutional monarchy  we must not reject the legitimate heir to the throne  mikhail alexandrovitch     october 27th  resolution passed by the conference of business men at moscow    the conference  insists that the provisional government take the following immediate measures in the army    1  forbidding of all political propaganda  the army must be out of politics    2  propaganda of antinational and international ideas and theories deny the necessity for armies  and hurt discipline  it should be forbidden  and all propagandists punished     3  the function of the army committees must be limited to economic questions exclusively  all their decisions should be confirmed by their superior officers  who have the right to dissolve the committees at any time     4  the salute to be reestablished  and made obligatory  full reestablishment of disciplinary power in the hands of officers  with right of review of sentence     5  expulsion from the corps of officers of those who dishonour it by participating in the movement of the soldier masses  which teaches them disobedience   reestablishment for this purpose of the courts of honor     6  the provisional government should take the necessary measures to make possible the return to the army of generals and other officers unjustly discharged under the influence of committees  and other irresponsible organisations                             appendix to chapter ii                                   1   the kornilov revolt is treated in detail in my forthcoming volume   kornilov to brest litovsk   the responsibility of kerensky for the situation which gave rise to kornilov s attempt is now pretty clearly established  many apologists for kerensky say that he knew of kornilov s plans  and by a trick drew him out prematurely  and then crushed him  even mr  a  j  sack  in his book   the birth of the russian democracy   says    several things  are almost certain  the first is that kerensky knew about the movement of several detachments from the front toward petrograd  and it is possible that as prime minister and minister of war  realising the growing bolshevist danger  he called for them     the only flaw in that argument is that there was no  bolshevist danger  at that time  the bolsheviki still being a powerless minority in the soviets  and their leaders in jail or hiding                                    2                           democratic conference  when the democratic conference was first proposed to kerensky  he suggested an assembly of all the elements in the nation  the live forces   as he called them including bankers  manufacturers  land owners  and representatives of the cadet party  the soviet refused  and drew up the following table of representation  which kerensky agreed

ee kah   published an article which said  speaking of the last provisional ministry    at last a truly democratic government  born of the will of all classes of the russian people  the first rough form of the future liberal parliamentary r gime  has been formed  ahead of us is the constituent assembly  which will solve all questions of fundamental law  and whose composition will be essentially democratic  the function of the soviets is at an end  and the time is approaching when they must retire  with the rest of the revolutionary machinery  from the stage of a free and victorious people  whose weapons shall hereafter be the peaceful ones of political action    the leading article of  izviestia  for october 23d was called   the crisis in the soviet organisations   it began by saying that travellers reported a lessening activity of local soviets everywhere   this is natural   said the writer   for the people are becoming interested in the more permanent legislative organs the municipal dumas and the zemstvs     in the important centres of petrograd and moscow  where the soviets were best organised  they did not take in all the democratic elements   the majority of the intellectuals did not participate  and many workers also  some of the workers because they were politically backward  others because the centre of gravity for them was in their unns   we cannot deny that these organisations are firmly united with the masses  whose everyday needs are better served by them     that the local democratic administrations are being energetically organised is highly important  the city dumas are elected by universal suffrage  and in purely local matters have more authority than the soviets  not a single democrat will see anything wrong in this       elections to the municipalities are being conduct in a better and more democratic way than the elections to the soviets  all classes are represented in the municipalities   and as soon as the local self governments begin to organise life in the municipalities  the r le of the local soviets naturally ends       there are two factors in the falling off of interest in the soviets  the first we may attribute to the lowering of political interest in the masses  the second  to the growing effort of provincial and local governing bodies to organise the building of new russia   the more the tendency lies in this latter direction  the sooner disappears the significance of the soviets     we ourselves are being called the  undertakers  of our own organisation  in reality  we ourselves are the hardest workers in constructing the new russia     when autocracy and the whole bureaucratic r gimeell  we set up the soviets as a barracks in which all the democracy cod find temporary shelter  now  instead of barracks  we are building the permanent edifice of a new system  and naturally the people will gradually leave the barracks for more comfortable quarters                                     4           trotzky s speech at the council of the russin republic   the purpose of the democratic conference  which was called by the  tsay ee kah   was to do away with the irresponsible personal government which produced kornilov  and to establish a responsible government which would be capable of finishing the war  and ensure the calling of the constituent assembly at the given time  in the meanwhile behind the back of the democratic conference  by trickery  by deals between citizen kerensky  the cadets  and the leaders of the menshevik and socialist revolutionary parties  we received the opposite result from the officially announced purpose  a power was created around which and in which we have open and secret kornilovs playing leading parts  the irresponsibility of the government is offically proclaimed  when it is announced that the council of the russian republic is to be a  consultative  and not  legislative  body  in the eighth month of the revolution  the irresponsible government creates a cover for itself in this new edition of bieligen s duma    the propertied classes have entered this provision council in a proportion which clearly shows  from elections all over the country  that many of them have no right here whatever  in spite of that the cadet party  which until yesterday wanted the provisional government to be responsible to the state duma this same cadet party secured the independence assembly the propertied classes will no doubt have as favourable position than they have in this council  and they will not be able to be irresponsible to the constituent assembly    if the propertied classes were really getting ready for the constituent assembly six weeks from now  there could be no reason for establishing the irresponsibility of the government at this time  the whole truth is that the bourgeoisie  which directs the policies of the provisional government  has for its aim to break the constituent assembly  at present this is the main purpose of the propertied classes  which control our entire national policy external and internal  in the industrial  agrarian and supply departments the politics of the propertied classes  acting with the government  increases the natural disorganisation caused by the war  the propertied classes  which are provoking a peasants  revolt  the propertied classes  which are provoking civil war  and openly hold their course on the bony hand of hunger  with which they intend to overthrow the revolution and finish with the constituent assembly    no less criminal also is the international policy of the bourgeoisie and its government  after forty months of war  the capital is threatened with mortal danger  in reply to this arises a plan to move the government to moscow  the idea of abandoning the capital does not stir the indignation of the bourgeoisie  just the opposite  it is accepted as a natural part of the general policy designed to promote counter revolutionary conspiracy    instead of recognising that the salvation of the country lies in concluding peace  instead of throwing openly the idea of immediate peace to all the worn out peoples  over the heads of diplomats and imperialists  and making the continuation of the war impossible  the provisional government  by order of the cadets  the counter revolutionists and the allied imperialists  without sense  without purpose and without a plan  continues to drag on the murderous war  sentencing to useless death new hundreds of thousands of soldiers and sailors  and preparing to give up petrograd  and to wreck the revolution  at a time when bolshevik soldiers and sailors are dying with other soldiers and sailors as a result of the mistakes and crimes of others  the so called supreme commander  kerensky  continues to suppress the bolshevik press  the leading parties of the council are acting as a voluntary cover for these policies    we  the faction of social democrats bolsheviki  announce that with this government of treason to the people we have nothing in common  we have nothing in common with the work of these murderers of the people which goes on behind official curtains  we refuse either directly or indirectly to cover up one day of this work  while wilhelm s troops are threatening petrograd  the government of kerensky and kornilov is preparing to run away from petrograd and turn moscow into a base of counter revolution    we warn the moscow workers and soldiers to be on their guard  leaving this council  we appeal to the manhood and wisdom of the workers  peasants and soldiers of all russia  petrograd is in danger  the revolution is in danger  the government has increased the danger the ruling classes intensify it  only the people themselves can save themselves and the country    we appeal to the people  long live immediate  honest  democratic peace  all power to the soviets  all land to the people  long live the constituent assembly

be independent in its commercial relations  and must not be obliged to  or prevented from  concluding an economic treaty  by the treaty of peace  nevertheless  all nations should bind themselves  by the peace treaty  not to practise an economic blockade after the war  nor to form separate tariff agreements  the right of most favoured nation must be given to all countries without distinction                    guarantees of peace   peace is to be concluded at the peace conference by delegates elected by the national representative institutions of each country  the peace terms are to be confirmed by these parliaments   secret diplomacy is to be abolished  all parties are to bind themselves not to conclude any secret treaties  such treaties are declared in contradiction to international law  and void  all treaties  until confirmed by the parliaments of the different nations  are to be considered void   gradual disarmament both on land and sea  and the establishment of a militia system  the  league of nations  advanced by president wilson may become a valuable aid to international law  provided that  a   all nations are to be obliged to participate in it with equal rights  and  b   international politics are to be democratised                    ways to peace   the allies are to announce immediately that they are willing to open peace negotiations as soon as the enemy powers declare their consent to the renunciation of all forcible annexations   the allies must bind themselves not to begin any peace negotiations  nor to conclude peace  except in a general peace conference with the participation of delegates from all the neutral countries   all obstacles to the stockholm socialist conference are to be removed  and passports are to be given immediately to all delegates of parties and organisations who wish to participate    the executive committee of the peasants  soviets also issued a  nakaz   which differs little from the above                                     6                           peace at russia s expense  the ribot revelations of austria s peace offer to france  the so called  peace conference  at berne  switzerland  during the summer of 1917  in which delegates participated from all belligerent countries  representing large financial interests in all these countries  and the attempted negotiations of an english agent with a bulgarian church dignitary  all pointed to the fact that there were strong currents  on both sides  favourable to patching up a peace at the expense of russia  in my next book   kornilov to brest litovsk   i intend to treat this matter at some length  publishing several secret documents discovered in the ministry of foreign affairs at petrograd                                    7                        russian soldiers in france   official report of the provisional government     from the time the news of the russian revolution reached paris  russian newspapers of extreme tendencies immediately began to appear  and these newspapers  as well as individuals  freely circulated among the soldier masses and began a bolshevik propaganda  often spreading false news which appeared in the french journals  in the absence of all official news  and of precise details  this campaign provoked discontent among the soldiers  the result was a desire to return to russia  and a hatred toward the officers    finally it all turned into rebellion  in one of their meetings  the soldiers issued an appeal to refuse to drill  since they had decided to fight no more  it was decided to isolate the rebels  and general zankievitch ordered all soldiers loyal to the provisional government to leave the camp of courtine  and to carry with them all ammunition  on june 25th the order was executed  there remained at the camp only the soldiers who said they would submit  conditionally  to the provisional government  the soldiers at the camp of courtine received several times the visit of the commander in chief of the russian armies abroad  of rapp  the commissar of the ministry of war  and of several distinguished former exiles who wished to influence them  but these attempts were unsuccessful  and finally commissar rapp insisted that the rebels lay down their arms  and  in sign of submission  march in good order to a place called clairvaux  the order was only partially obeyed  first 500 men went out  of whom 22 were arrested  24 hours later about 6 000 followed   about 2 000 remained     it was decided to increase the pressure  their rations were diminished  their pay was cut off  and the roads toward the village of courtine were guarded by french soldiers  general zankievitch  having discovered that a russian artillery brigade was passing through france  decided to form a mixed detachment of infantry and artillery to reduce the rebels  a deputation  was sent to the rebels  the deputation returned several hours later  convinced of the futility of the negotiations  on september 1st general zankievitch sent an ultimatum to the rebels demanding that they lay down their arms  and menacing in case of refusal to open fire with artillery if the order was not obeyed by september 3d at 10 o clock    the order not being executed  a light fire of artillery was opened on the place at the hour agreed upon  eighteen shells were fired  and the rebels were warned that the bombardment would become more intense  in the night of september 3d 160 men surrendered  september 4th the artillery bombardment recommenced  and at 11 o clock  after 36 shells had been fired  the rebels raised two white flags and began to leave the camp without arms  by evening 8 300 men had surrendered  150 soldiers who remained in the camp opened fire with machine guns that night  the 5th of september  to make an end of the affair  a heavy barrage was laid on the camp  and our soldiers occupied it little by little  the rebels kept up a heavy fire with their machine guns  september 6th  at 9 o clock  the camp was entirely occupied   after the disarmament of the rebels  81 arrests were made     thus the report  from secret documents discovered in the ministry of foreign affairs  however  we know that the account is not strictly accurate  the first trouble arose when the soldiers tried to form committees  as their comrades in russia were doing  they demanded to be sent back to russia  which was refused  and then  being considered a dangerous influence in france  they were ordered to salonika  they refused to go  and the battle followed   it was discovered that they had been left in camp without officers for about two months  and badly treated  before they became rebellious  all attempts to find out the name of the  russian artillery brigade  which had fired on them were futile  the telegrams discovered in the ministry left it to be inferred that french artillery was used    after their surrender  more than two hundred of the mutineers were shot in cold blood                                    8                         terestchenko s speech   resum        the questions of foreign policy are closely related to those of national defence   and so  if in questions of national defence you think it is necessary to hold session in secret  also in our foreign policy we are sometimes forced to observe the same secrecy     german diplomacy attempts to influence public opinion   therefore the declarations of directors of great democratic organisations who talk loudly of a revolutionary congress  and the impossibility of another winter campaign  are dangerous   all these declarations cost human lives     i wish to speak merely of governmental logic  without touching the questions of the honour and dignity of the state  from the point of view of logic  the foreign policy of russia ought to be based on a real comprehension of the  interests  of russia   these interests mean that it is impossible that our country remain alone  and that the present alignment of forces with us   the allies   is satisfactory   all humanity longs for peace  but in russia no one will permit a humiliating peace which would violate the state interests of our fatherland    the orator pointed out that such a peace would for long years  if not for centuries  retard the triumph of democratic principles in the world  and would inevitably cause new wars    all remember the days of may  when the fraternisation on our front threatened to end the war by a simple cessation of military operations  and lead the country to a shameful separate peace  and what efforts it was necessary to use to make the soldier masses at the front understand that it was not by this method that the russian state must end the war and guarantee its interest     he spoke of the miraculous effect of the july offensive  what strength it gave to the words of russian ambassadors abroad  and the despair in germany caused by the russian victories  and also  the disillusionment in allied countries which followed the russian defeat     as to the russian government  it adhered strictly to the formula of may   no annexations and no punitive indemnities   we consider it essential not only to proclaim the self determination of peoples  but also to renounce imperialist aims     germany is continually trying to make peace  the only talk in germany is of peace  she knows she cannot win    i reject the reproaches aimed at the government which allege that russian foreign policy does not speak clearly enough about the aims of the war     if the question arises as to what ends the allies are pursuing  it is indispensable first to demand what aims the central powers have agreed upon     the desire is often heard that we publish the details of the treaties which bind the allies  but people forget that  up to now  we do not know the treaties which bind the central powers     germany  he said  evidently wants to separate russia from the west by a series of weak buffer states    this tendency to strike at the vital interests of russia must be checked     and will the russian democracy  which has inscribed on its banner the rights of nations to dispose of themselves  allow calmly the continuation of oppression upon the most civilised peoples  in austria hungary     those who fear that the allies will try to profit by our difficult situation  to make us support more than our share of the burden of war  and to solve the questions of peace at our expense  are entirely mistaken   our enemy looks upon russia as a market for its products  the end of the war will leave us in a feeble condition  and with our frontier open the flood of german products can easily hold back for years our industrial development  measures must be taken to guard against this     i say openly and frankly  the combination of forces which unites us to the allies is  favourable to the interests of russia    it is therefore important that our views on the questions of war and peace shall be in accord with the views of the allies as clearly and precisely as possible   to avoid all misunderstanding  i must say frankly that russia must present at the paris conference  one point of view      he did not want to comment on the  nakaz  to skobeliev  but he referred to the manifesto of the dutch scandinavian committee  just published in stockholm  this manifesto declared for the autonomy of lithuania and livonia   but that is clearly impossible   said terestchenko   for russia must have free ports on the baltic all the year round     in this question the problems of foreign policy are also closely related to interior politics  for if there existed a strong sentiment of unity of all great russia  one would not witness the repeated manifestations  everywhere  of a desire of peoples to separate from the central government   such separations are contrary to the interests of russia  and the russian delegates cannot raise the issue                                      9                          the british fleet   etc     at the time of the naval battle of the gulf of riga  not only the bolsheviki  but also the ministers of the provisional government  considered  that the british fleet had deliberately abandoned the baltic  as one indication of the attitude so often expressed publicly by the british press  and semi publicly by british representatives in russia   russia s finished  no use bothering about russia    see interview with kerensky  appendix 13    general gurko was a former chief of staff of the russian armies under the tsar  he was a prominent figure in the corrupt imperial court  after the revolution  he was one of the very few persons exiled for his political and personal record  the russian naval defeat in the gulf of riga coincided with the public reception  by king george in london  of general gurko  a man whom the russian provisional government considered dangerously pro german as well as reactionary                                   10                        appeals against insurrection                           to workers and soldiers    comrades  the dark forces are increasingly trying to call forth in petrograd and other towns disorders and  pogroms   disorder is necessary to the dark forces  for disorder will give them an opportunity for crushing the revolutionary movement in blood  under the pretext of establishing order  and of protecting the inhabitants  they hope to establish the domination of kornilov  which the revolutionary people succeeded in suppressing not long ago  woe to the people if these hopes are realised  the triumphant counter revolution will destroy the soviets and the army committees  will disperse the constituent assembly  will stop the transfer of the land to the land committees  will put an end to all the hopes of the people for a speedy peace  and will fill all the prisons with revolutionary soldiers and workers    in their calculations  the counter revolutionists and black hundred leaders are counting on the serious discontent of the unenlightened part of the people with the disorganisation of the food supply  the continuation of the war  and the general difficulties of life  they hope to transform every demonstration of soldiers and workers into a  pogrom   which will frighten the peaceful population and throw it into the arms of the restorers of law and order    under such conditions every attempt to organise a demonstration in these days  although for the most laudable object  would be a crime  all conscious workers and soldiers who are displeased with the policy of the government will only bring injury to themselves and to the revolution if they indulge in demonstrations    therefore the  tsay ee kah  asks all workers not to obey any calls to demonstrate    workers and soldiers  do not yield to provocation  remember your duty to your country and to the revolution  do not break the unity of the revolutionary front by demonstrations which are bound to be unsuccessful     the central executive committee of the soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies  tsay ee kah     russian social democratic labour party  the danger is near  to all workers and soldiers   read and hand to others     comrades workers and soldiers     our country is in danger  on account of this danger our freedom and our revolution are passing through difficult days  the enemy is at the gates of petrograd  the disorganisation is growing with every hours  it becomes more and more difficult to obtain bread for petrograd  all  of from the smallest to the greatest  must redouble their efforts  must endeavour to arrange things properly   we must save our country  say freedom   more arms and provisions for the army  bread for the great cities  order and organisation in the country     and in these terrible critical days rumours creep about that somewhere a demonstration is being prepared  that some one is calling on the soldiers and workers to destroy revolutionary peace and order    rabotchi put   the newspaper of the bolsheviki  is pouring oil on the flames  it flattering  trying to please the unenlightened people  tempting the worker and soldiers  urging them on against the government  promising them mountains of good things   the confiding  ignorant men believe  they do not reason   and from the other side come also rumours rumours that the dark forces  the friends of the tsar  the german spies  are rubbing their hands with glee  they are ready to join the bolsheviki  and with them fan the disorders into civil war    the bolsheviki and the ignorant soldiers and workers seduced by them cry senselessly   down with the government  all power to the soviets   and the dark servants of the tsar and the spies of wilhelm will egg the on   beat the jews  beat the shopkeepers  rob the markets  devastate the shops  pillage the wine stores  slay  burn  rob     and then will begin a terrible confusion  a war between one part of the people and the other  all will become still more disorganised  and perhaps once more blood will be shed on the streets of the capital  and then what then    then  the road to petrograd will be open to wilhelm  then  no bread will come to petrograd  the children will die of hunger  then  the army as the front will remain without support  our brothers in the trenches will be delivered to the fire of the enemy  then  russia will lose all prestige in other countries  our money will lose its value  everything will be so dear as to make life impossible  then  the long awaited constituent assembly will be postponed it will be impossible to convene it in time  and then death to the revolution  death to our liberty     is it this that you want  workers and soldiers  no  if you do not then go  go to the ignorant people seduced by the betrayers  and tell them the whole truth  which we have told you    let all know that every man who in these terrible days calls on you to come out in the streets against the government  is either a secret servant of the tsar  a provocator  or an unwise assistant of the enemies of the people  or a paid spy of wilhelm    every conscious worker revolutionist  every conscious peasant  every revolutionary soldier  all who understand what harm a demonstration or a revolt against the government might cause to the people  must join together and not allow the enemies of the people to destroy our freedom     the petrograd electoral committee of the mensheviki oborontzi                                    11                       lenin s  letter to the comrades   this series of articles appeared in  rabotchi put  several days running  at the end of october and beginning of november  1917  i give here only extracts from two instalments   1  kameniev and riazanov say that we have not a majority among the people  and that without a majority insurrection is hopeless    answer  people capable of speaking such things are falsifiers  pedants  or simply don t want to look the real situation in the face  in the last elections we received in all the country more than fifty per cent of all thevotes     the most important thing in russia to day is the peasants  revolution  in tambov government there has been a real agrarian uprising with wonderful political results   even  dielo naroda  has been scared into yelling that the land must be turned over to the peasants  and not only the socialist revolutionaries in the council of the republic  but also the government itself  has been similarly affected  another valuable result was the bringing of bread which had been hoarded by the  pomieshtchiki  to the railroad stations in that province  the  russkaya volia  had to admit that the stations were filled with bread after the peasants  rising     2  we are not sufficiently strong to take over the government  and the bourgeoisie is not sufficiently strong to prevent the constituent assembly    answer  this is nothing but timidity  expressed by pessimism as regards workers and soldiers  and optimism as regards the failure of the bourgeoisie  if  yunkers  and cossacks say they will fight  you believe them  if workmen and soldiers say so  you doubt it  what is the distinction between such doubts and siding politically with the bourgeoisie    kornilov proved that the soviets were really a power  to believe kerensky and the council of the republic  if the bourgeoisie is not strong enough to break the soviets  it is not strong enough to break the constituent  but that is wrong  the bourgeoisie will break the constituent by sabotage  by lock outs  by giving up petrograd  by opening the front to the germans  this has already been done in the case of riga     3  the soviets must remain a revolver at the head of the government to force the calling of the constituent assembly  and to suppress any further kornilov attempts    answer  refusal of insurrection is refusal of  all power to the soviets   since september the bolshevik party has been discussing the question of insurrection  refusing to rise means to trust our hopes in the faith of the good bourgeoisie  who have  promised  to call the constituent assembly  when the soviets have all the power  the calling of the constituent is guaranteed  and its success assured    refusal of insurrection means surrender to the  lieber dans   either we must drop  all power to the soviets  or make an insurrection  there is no middle course     4  the bourgeoisie cannot give up petrograd  although the rodziankos want it  because it is not the bourgeoisie who are fighting  but our heroic soldiers and sailors    answer  this did not prevent two admirals from running away at the moonsund battle  the staff has not changed  it is composed of kornilovtsi  if the staff  with kerensky at its head  wants to give up petrograd  it can do it doubly or trebly  it can make arrangements with the germans or the british  open the fronts  it can sabotage the army s food supply  at all these doors has it knocked    we have no right to wait until the bourgeoisie chokes the revolution  rodzianko is a man of action  who has faithfully and truthfully served the bourgeoisie for years   half the lieber dans are cowardly compromisers  half of them simple fatalists      5  we re getting stronger every day  we shall be able to enter the constituent assembly as a strong opposition  then why should we play everything on one card     answer  this is the argument of a sophomore with no practical experience  who reads that the constituent assembly is being called and trustfully accepts the legal and constitutional way  even the voting of the constituent assembly will not do away with hunger  or beat wilhelm   the issue of hunger and of surrendering petrograd cannot be decided by waiting for the constituent assembly  hunger is not waiting  the peasants  revolution is not waiting  the admirals who ran away did not wait    blind people are surprised that hungry people  betrayed by admirals and generals  do not take an interest in voting    6  if the kornilovtsi make an attempt  we would show them our strength  but why should we risk everything by making an attempt ourselves    answer  history doesn t repeat   perhaps kornilov will some day make an attempt   what a serious base for proletarian action  but suppose kornilov waits for starvation  for the opening of the fronts  what then  this attitude means to build the tactics of a revolutionary party on one of the bourgeoisie s former mistakes    let us forget everything except that there is no way out but by the dictatorship of the proletariat either that or the dictatorship of kornilov    let us wait  comrades  for a miracle                                    12                         miliukov s speech   resum      every one admits  it seems  that the defence of the country is our principal task  and that  to assure it  we must have discipline in the army and order in the rear  to achieve this  there must be a power capable of daring  not only by persuasion  but also by force   the germ of all our evils comes from the point of view  original  truly russian  concerning foreign policy  which passes for the internationalist point of view    the noble lenin only imitates the noble keroyevsky when he holds that from russia will come the new world which shall resuscitate the aged west  and which will replace the old banner of doctrinary socialism by the new direct action of starving masses and that will push humanity forward and force it to break in the doors of the social paradise     these men sincerely believed that the decomposition of russia would bring about the decomposition of the whole capitalist r gime  starting from that point of view  they were able to commit the unconscious treason  in wartime  of calmly telling the soldiers to abandon the trenches  and instead of fighting the external enemy  creating internal civil war and attacking the proprietors and capitalists    here miliukov was interrupted by furious cries from the left  demanding what socialist had ever advised such action     martov says that only the revolutionary pressure of the proletariat can condemn and conquer the evil will of imperialist cliques and break down the dictatorship of these cliques   not by an accord between governments for a limitation of armaments  but by the disarming of these governments and the radical democratisation of the military system     he attacked martov viciously  and then turned on the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries  whom he accused of entering the government as ministers with the avowed purpose of carrying on the class struggle    the socialists of germany and of the allied countries contemplated these gentlemen with ill concealed contempt  but they decided that it was for russia  and sent us some apostles of the universal conflagration     the formula of our democracy is very simple  no foreign policy  no art of diplomacy  an immediate democratic peace  a declaration to the allies   we want nothing  we haven t anything to fight with   and then our adversaries will make the same declaration  and the brotherhood of peoples will be accomplished    miliukov took a fling at the zimmerwald manifesto  and declared that even kerensky has not been able to escape the influence of  that unhappy document which will forever be your indictment   he then attacked skobeliev  whose position in foreign assemblies  where he would appear as a russian delegate  yet opposed to the foreign policy of his government  would be so strange that people would say   what s that gentleman carrying  and what shall we talk to him about   as for the  nakaz   miliukov said that he himself was a pacifist  that he believed in the creation of an international arbitration board  and the necessity for a limitation of armaments  and parliamentary control over secret diplomacy  which did not mean the abolition of secret diplomacy   as for the socialist ideas in the  nakaz   which he called  stockholm ideas  peace without victory  the right of self determination of peoples  and renunciation of the economic war    the german successes are directly proportionate to the successes of those who call themselves the revolutionary democracy  i do not wish to say   to the successes of the revolution   because i believe that the defeats of the revolutionary democracy are victories for the revolution     the influence of the soviet leaders abroad is not unimportant  one had only to listen to the speech of the minister of foreign affairs to be convinced that  in this hall  the influence of the revolutionary democracy on foreign policy is so strong  that the minister does not dare to speak face to face with it about the honour and dignity of russia    we can see  in the  nakaz  of the soviets  that the ideas of the stockholm manifesto have been elaborated in two direction that of utopianism  and that of german interests    interrupted by the angry cries of the left  and rebuked by the president  miliukov insisted that the proposition of peace concluded by popular assemblies  not by diplomats  and the proposal to undertake peace negotiations as soon as the enemy had renounced annexations  were pro german  recently kuhlman said that a personal declaration bound only him who made it    anyway  we will imitate the germans before we will imitate the soviet of workers  and soldiers  deputies     the sections treating of the independence of lithuania and livonia were symptoms of nationalist agitation in different parts of russia  supported  said miliukov  by german money   amid bedlam from the left  he contrasted the clauses of the  nakaz  concerning alsace lorraine  rumania  and serbia  with those treating of the nationalities in germany and austria  the  nakaz  embraced the german and austrian point of view  said miliukov   passing to terestchenko s speech  he contemptuously accused him of being afraid to speak the thought in his mind  and even afraid to think in terms of the greatness of russia  the dardanelles must belong to russia     you are continually saying that the soldier does not know why he is fighting  and that when he does know  he ll fight   it is true that the soldier doesn t know why he is fighting  but now you have told him that there is no reason for him to fight  that we have no national interests  and that we are fighting for alien ends     paying tribute to the allies  who  he said  with the assistance of america   will yet save the cause of humanity   he ended    long live the light of humanity  the advanced democracies of the west  who for a long time have been travelling the way we now only begin to enter  with ill assured and hesitating steps  long live our brave allies                                    13                           interview with kerensky  the associated press man tried his hand   mr  kerensky   he began   in england and france people are disappointed with the revolution      yes  i know   interrupted kerensky  quizzically   abroad the revolution is no longer fashionable     what is your explanation of why the russians have stopped fighting     that is a foolish question to ask   kerensky was annoyed   russia entered the war first of all the allies  and for a long time she bore the whole brunt of it  her losses have been inconceivably greater than those of all the other nations put together  russia has now the right to demand of the allies that they bring greater force of arms to bear   he stopped for a moment and stared at his interlocutor   you are asking why the russians have stopped fighting  and the russians are asking where is the british fleet with german battle ships in the gulf of riga   again he ceased suddenly  and as suddenly burst out   the russian revolution hasn t failed and the revolutionary army hasn t failed  it is not the revolution which caused disorganisation in the army that disorganisation was accomplished years ago  by the old regime  why aren t the russians fighting  i will tell you  because the masses of the people are economically exhausted  and because they are disillusioned with the allies    the interview of which this is an excerpt was cabled to the united states  and in a few days sent back by the american state department  with a demand that it be  altered   this kerensky refused to do  but it was done by his secretary  dr  david soskice and  thus purged of all offensive references to the allies  was given to the press of the world                            appendix to chapter iii                                   1                   resolution of the factory shop committees                           workers  control   1   see ppage 43  2  the organisation of workers  control is a manifestation of the same healthy activity in the sphere of industrial production  as are party organisations in the sphere of politics  trade unions in employment  cooperatives in the domain of consumption  and literary clubs in the sphere of culture   3  the working class has much more interest in the proper and uninterrupted operation of factories  than the capitalist class  workers  control is a better security in this respect for the interests of modern society  of the whole people  than the arbitrary will of the owners  who are guided only by their selfish desire for material profits or political privileges  therefore workers  control is demanded by the proletariat not only in their own interest  but in the interest of the whole country  and should be supported by the revolutionary peasantry as well as the revolutionary army   4  considering the hostile attitude of the majority of the capitalist class toward the revolution  experience shows that proper distribution of raw materials and fuel  as well as the most efficient management of factories  is impossible without workers  control   5  only workers  control over capitalist enterprises  cultivating the workers  conscious attitude toward work  and making clear its social meaning  can create conditions favourable to the development of a firm self discipline in labour  and the development of all labour s possible productivity   6  the impending transformation of industry from a war to a peace basis  and the redistribution of labour all over the country  as well as among the different factories  can be accomplished without great disturbances only by means of the democratic self government of the workers themselves   therefore the realisation of workers  control is an indispensable preliminary to the demobilisation of industry   7  in accordance with the slogan proclaimed by the russian social democratic labour party  bolsheviki   workers  control on a national scale  in order to bring results  must extend to all capitalist concerns  and not be organised accidentally  without system  it must be well planned  and not separated from the industrial life of the country as a whole   8  the economic life of the country agriculture  industry  commerce and transport must be subjected to one unified plan  constructed so as to satisfy the individual and social requirements of the wide masses of the people  it must be approved by their elected representatives  and carried out under the direction of these representatives by means of national and local organisations   9  that part of the plan which deals with land labour must be carried out under supervision of the peasants  and land workers  organisations  that relating to industry  trade and transport operated by wage earners  by means of workers  control  the natural organs of workers  control inside the industrial plant will be the factory shop and similar committees  and in the labour market  the trade unions   10  the collective wage agreements arranged by the trade unions for the majority of workers in any branch of labour  must be binding on all the owners of plants employing this kind of labour in the given district   11  employment bureaus must be placed under the control and management of the trade unions  as class organisations acting within the limits of the whole industrial plan  and in accordance with it   12  trade unions must have the right  upon their own initiative  to begin legal action against all employers who violate labour contracts or labour legislation  and also in behalf of any individual worker in any branch of labour   13  on all questions relating to workers  control over production  distribution and employment  the trade unions must confer with the workers of individual establishments through their factory shop committees   14  matters of employment and discharge  vacations  wage scales  refusal of work  degree of productivity and skill  reasons for abrogating agreements  disputes with the administration  and similar problems of the internal life of the factory  must be settled exclusively according to the findings of the factory shop committee  which has the right to exclude from participation in the discussion any members of the factory administration   15  the factory shop committee forms a commission to control the supplying of the factory with raw materials  fuel  orders  labour power and technical staff  including equipment   and all other supplies and arrangements  and also to assure the factory s adherence to the general industrial plan  the factory administration is obliged to surrender to the organs of workers  control  for their aid and information  all data concerning the business  to make it possible to verify this data  and to produce the books of the company upon demand of the factory shop committee   16  any illegal acts on the part of the administration discovered by the factory shop committees  or any suspicion of such illegal acts  which cannot be investigated or remedied by the workers alone  shall be referred to the district central organisation of factory shop committees charged with the particular branch of labour involved  which shall discuss the matter with the institutions charged with the execution of the general industrial plan  and find means to deal with the matter  even to the extent of confiscating the factory   17  the union of the factory shop committees of different concerns must be accomplished on the basis of the different trades  in order to facilitate control over the whole branch of industry  so as to come within the general industrial plan  and so as to create an effective plan of distribution among the different factories of orders  raw materials  fuel  technical and labour power  and also to facilitate cooperation with the trade unions  which are organised by trades   18  the central city councils of trade unions and factory shop committees represent the proletariat in the corresponding provincial and  local institutions formed to elaborate and carry out the general industrial plan  and to organise economic relations between the towns and the villages  workers and peasants   they also possess final authority for the management of factory shop committees and trade unions  so far as workers  control in their district is concerned  and they shall issue obligatory regulations concerning workers  discipline in the routine of production which regulations  however  must be approved by vote of the workers themselves                                    2                   the bourgeois press on the bolsheviki   russkaya volia   october 28   the decisive moment approaches   it is decisive for the bolsheviki  either they will give us  a second edition of the events of july 16 18  or they will have to admit that with their plans and intentions  with their impertinent policy of wishing to separate themselves from everything consciously national  they have been definitely defeated     what are the chances of bolshevik success    it is difficult to answer that question  for their principal support is the  ignorance of the popular masses  they speculate on it  they work upon it by a demagogy which nothing can stop     the government must play its part in this affair  supporting itself morally by the council of the republic  the government must take a clearly defined attitude toward the bolsheviki     and if the bolsheviki provoke an insurrection against the legal power  and thus facilitate the german invasion  they must be treated as mutineers and traitors      birzhevya viedomosti   october 28   now that the bolsheviki have separated themselves from the rest of the democracy  the struggle against them is very much simpler and it is not reasonable  in order to fight against bolshevism  to wait until they make a manifestation  the government should not even allow the manifestation     the appeals of the bolsheviki to insurrection and anarchy are acts punishable by the criminal courts  and in the freest countries  their authors would receive severe sentences  for what the bolsheviki are carrying on is not a political struggle against the government  or even for the power  it is propaganda for anarchy  massacres  and civil war  this propaganda must be extirpated at its roots  it would be strange to wait  in order to begin action against an agitation for  pogroms   until the  pogroms  actually occurred      novoye vremya   november 1   hellip  why is the government excited only about november 2d  date of calling of the congress of soviets   and not about september 12th  or october 3d    this is not the first time that russia burns and falls in ruins  and that the smoke of the terrible conflagration makes the eyes of our allies smart     since it came to power  has there been a single order issued by the government for the purpose of halting anarchy  or has any one attempted to put out the russian conflagration    there were other things to do     the government turned its attention to a more immediate problem  it crushed an insurrection  the kornilov attempt  concerning which every one is now asking   did it ever exist                                     3                   moderate socialist press on the bolsheviki   dielo naroda   october 28  socialist revolutionary    the most frightful crime of the bolsheviki against the revolution is that they impute  exclusively to the bad intentions of the revolutionary government all the calamities which the masses are so cruelly suffering  when as a matter of fact these calamities spring from objective causes    they make golden promises to the masses  knowing in advance that they can fulfil none of them  they lead the masses on a false trail  deceiving them as to the source of all their troubles     the bolsheviki are the most dangerous enemies of the revolution      dien   october 30  menshevik    is this really  the freedom of the press   every day  novaya rus  and  rabotchi put  openly incite to insurrection  every day these two papers commit in their columns actual crimes  every day they urge  pogroms    is that  the freedom of the press      the government ought to defend itself and defend us  we have the right to insist that the government machinery does not remain passive while the threat of bloody riots endangers the lives of its citizens                                      4                                yedinstvo   plekhanov s paper   yedinstvo   suspended publication a few weeks after the bolsheviki seized the power  contrary to popular report   yedinstvo  was not suppressed by the soviet government  an announcement in the last number admitted that it was unable to continue  because there were too few subscribers                                      5                   were the bolsheviki conspirators   the french newspaper  entente  of petrograd  on november 15th  published an article of which the following is a part    the government of kerensky discusses and hesitates  the government of lenin and trotzky attacks and acts    this last is called a government of conspirators  but that is wrong  government of usurpers  yes  like all revolutionary governments which triumph over their adversaries  conspirators no    no  they did not conspire  on the contrary  openly  audaciously  without mincing words  without dissimulating their intentions  they multiplied their agitation  intensified their propaganda in the factories  the barracks  at the front  in the country  everywhere  even fixing in advance the date of their taking up arms  the date of their seizure of the power      they  conspirators  never                                      6                       appeal against insurrection                  from the central army committee      above everything we insist upon the inflexible execution of the organised will of the majority of the people  expressed by the provisional government in accord with the council of the republic and the  tsay ee kah   as organ of the popular power     any demonstration to depose this power by violence  at a moment when a government crisis will infallibly create disorganisation  the ruin of the country  and civil war  will be considered by the army as a counter revolutionary act  and repressed by force of arms     the interests of private groups and classes should be submitted to a single interest that of augmenting industrial production  and distributing the necessities of life with fairness     all who are capable of sabotage  disorganisation  or disorder  all deserters  all slackers  all looters  should be forced to do auxiliary service in the rear of the army     we invite the provisional government to form  out of these violators of the people s will  these enemies of the revolution  labour detachments to work in the rear  on the front  in the trenches under enemy fire                                      7                   events of the night  november 6th  toward evening bands of red guards began to occupy the printing shops of the bourgeois press  where they printed  rabotchi put  soldat   and various proclamations by the hundred thousand  the city militia was ordered to clear these places  but found the offices barricaded  and armed men defending them  soldiers who were ordered to attack the print shops refused   about midnight a colonel with a company of  yunkers  arrived at the club  free mind   with a warrant to arrest the editor of  rabotchi put   immediately an enormous mob gathered in the street outside and threatened to lynch the  yunkers   the colonel thereupon begged that he and the  yunkers  be arrested and taken to peter paul prison for safety  this request was granted   at 1 a  m  a detachment of soldiers and sailors from smolny occupied the telegraph agency  at 1 35 the post office was occupied  toward morning the military hotel was taken  and at 5 o clock the telephone exchange  at dawn the state bank was surrounded  and at 10 a  m  a cordon of troops was drawn about the winter palace                           appendix to chapter iv                                   1                           events of november 7th  from 4 a  m  until dawn kerensky remained at the petrograd staff headquarters  sending orders to the cossacks and to the  yunkers  in the officers  schools in and around petrograd all of whom answered that they were unable to move   colonel polkovnikov  commandant of the city  hurried between the staff and the winter palace  evidently without any plan  kerensky gave an order to open the bridges  three hours passed without any action  and then an officer and five men went out on their own initiative  and putting to flight a picket of red guards  opened the nicolai bridge  immediately after they left  however  some sailors closed it again   kerensky ordered the print shop of  rabotchi put  to be occupied  the officer detailed to the work was promised a squad of soldiers  two hours later he was promised some  yunkers   then the order was forgotten   an attempt was made to recapture the post office and the telegraph agency  a few shots were fired  and the government troops announced that they would no longer oppose the soviets   to a delegation of  yunkers  kerensky said   as chief of the provisional government and as supreme commander i know nothing  i cannot advise you  but as a veteran revolutionist  i appeal to you  young revolutionists  to remain at your posts and defend the conquests of the revolution    orders of kishkin  november 7th    by decree of the provisional government   i am invested with extraordinary

peoples                                                         proclamation of the provisional government     the petrograd soviet   has declared the provisional government overthrown  and has demanded that the governmental power be turned over to it  under threat of bombarding the winter palace with the cannon of peter paul fortress  and of the cruiser  avrora   anchored in the neva    the government can surrender its authority only to the consituent assembly  for that reason it has decided not to submit  and to demand aid from the population and the army  a telegram has been sent to the  stavka   and an answer received says that a strong detachment of troops is being sent     let the army and the people reject the irresponsible attempts of the bolsheviki to create a revolt in the rear     about 9 a  m  kerensky left for the front    toward evening two soldiers on bicycles presented themselves at the staff headquarters  as delegates of the garrison of peter paul fortress  entering the meeting room of the staff  where kishkin  rutenburg  paltchinski  general bagratouni  colonel paradielov and count tolstoy were gathered  they demanded the immediate surrender of the staff  threatening  in case of refusal  to bombard headquarters   after two panicky conferences the staff retreated to the winter palace  and the headquarters were occupied by red guards    late in the afternoon several bolshevik armoured cars cruised around the palace square  and soviet soldiers tried unsuccessfully to parley with the  yunkers     firing on the palace began about 7 o clock in the evening    at 10 p  m  began an artillery bombardment from three sides  in which most of the shells were blanks  only three small shrapnels striking the facade of the palace

toward evening he was in ostrov  province of pskov  the next morning  extraordinary  session of the local soviet of workers  and soldiers  depulies  with participation of cossack delegates there being 6 000 cossacks at ostrov   kerensky spoke to the assembly  appealing for aid against the bolsheviki  and addressed himself almost exclusively to the cossacks  the soldier delegates protested    why did you come here   shouted voices  kerensky answered   to ask the cossacks  assistance in crushing the bolshevik insurrection   at this there were violent protestations  which increased when he continued   i broke the kornilov attempt  and i will break the bolsheviki   the noise became so great that he had to leave the platform    the soldier deputies and the ussuri cossacks decided to arrest kerensky  but the don cossacks prevented them  and got him away by train   a military revolutionary committee  set up during the day  tried to inform the garrison of pskov  but the telephone and telegraph lines were cut    kerensky did not arrive at pskov  revolutionary soldiers had cut the railway line  to prevent troops being sent against the capital  on the night of november 8th he arrived by automobile at luga  where he was well received by the death battalions stationed there   next day he took train for the south west front  and visited the army committee at headquarters  the fifth army  however  was wild with enthusiasm over the news of the bolshevik success  and the army committee was unable to promise kerensky any support   from there he went to the  stavka   at moghilev  where he ordered ten regiments from different parts of the front to move against petrograd  the soldiers almost unanimously refused  and those regiments which did start halted on the way  about five thousand cossacks finally followed him                                     3                       looting of the winter palace  i do not mean to maintain that there was no looting  in the winter palace  both after and  before  the winter palace fell  there was considerable pilfering  the statement of the socialist revolutionary paper  narod   and of members of the city duma  to the effect that precious objects to the value of 500 000 000 rubles had been stolen  was  however  a gross exaggeration   the most important art treasures of the palace paintings  statues  tapestries  rare porcelains and armorie  had been transferred to moscow during the month of september  and they were still in good order in the basement of the imperial palace there ten days after the capture of the kremlin by bolshevik troops  i can personally testify to this    individuals  however  especially the general public  which was allowed to circulate freely through the winter palace for several days after its capture  made away with table silver  clocks  bedding  mirrors and some odd vases of valuable porcelain and semi precious stone  to the value of about  50 000   the soviet government immediately created a special commission  composed of artists and arch ologists  to recover the stolen objects  on november 1st two proclamations were issued                            citizens of petrograd    we urgently ask all citizens to exert every effort to find whatever possible of the objects stolen from the winter palace in the night of november 7 8  and to forward them to the

to the complete charge of the artistic arch ological commission  and declaring that henceforth all governmental activities within its wall were prohibited                                     4

duma  about the fate of the women s battalion defending the palace  it was said that some of the girl soldiers had been thrown from the windows into the street  most of the rest had been violated  and many had committed suicide as a result of the horrors they had gone through   the city duma appointed a commission to investigate the matter  on november 16th the commission returned from levashovo  headquarters of the women s battalion  madame tyrkova reported that the girls had been at first taken to the barracks of the pavlovsky regiment  and that there some of them had been badly treated  but that at present most of them were at levashovo  and the rest scattered about the city in private houses  dr  mandelbaum  another of the commission  testified drily that  none  of the women had been thrown out of the windows of the winter palace  that  none  were wounded  that three had been violated  and that one had committed suicide  leaving a note which said that she had been  disappointed in her ideals    on november 21st the military revolutionary committee officially dissolved the women s battalion  at the request of the girls themselves  who returned to civilian clothes   in louise

constituent assembly  the people s revolutionary army must not permit troops of doubtful morale to be sent to petrograd  act by means of arguments  by means of moral suasion but if that fails  halt the movement of troops by implacable force    the present order must be immediately read to all military units of every branch of the service  whoever keeps the knowledge of this order from the soldier masses   commits a serious crime against the revolution  and will be punished with all the rigour of revolutionary law    soldiers  for peace  bread  land  and popular government

duma  elected on the most democratic principles  has undertaken the burden of managing municipal affairs and food supplies at the time of the greatest disorganisation  at the present moment the bolshevik party  three weeks before the elections to the constituent assembly  and in spite of the menace of the external enemy  having removed by armed force the only legal revolutionary authority  is making an attempt against the rights and independence of the municipal self government  demanding submission to its commissars and its illegal authority    in this terrible and tragic moment the petrograd city duma  in the face of its constituents  and of all russia  declares loudly that it will not submit to any encroachments on its rights and its independence  and will remain at the post of responsibility to which it has been called by the will of the population of the capital    the central city duma of petrograd appeals to all dumas and zemstvos of the russian republic to rally to the

peasants   nakaz   the land question can only be permanently settled by the general constituent assembly   the most equitable solution of the land question should be as follows   1  the right of

s cabinet  to monasteries  churches  possession lands  entailed lands  private estates  communal lands  peasant free holds  and others  are confiscated without compensation  and become national property  and are placed at the disposition of the workers who cultivate them   those who are damaged because of this social transformation of the rights of property are entitled to public aid during the time necessary for them to adapt themselves to the new conditions of existence   2  all the riches beneath the earth ores  oil  coal  salt  etc  as well as forests and waters having a national importance  become the exclusive property of the state  all minor streams  lakes and forests are placed in the hands of the communities  on condition of being managed by the local organs of government   3  all plots of land scientifically cultivated gardens  plantations  nurseries  seed plots  green houses  and others shall not be divided  but transformed into model farms  and pass into the hands of the state or of the community  according to their size and importance   buildings  communal lands and villages with their private gardens and their orchards remain in the hands of their present owners  the dimensions of these plots and the rate of taxes for their use shall be fixed by law   4  all studs  governmental and private cattle breeding and bird breeding establishments  and others  are confiscated and become national property  and are transferred either to the state or to the community  according to their size and importance   all questions of compensation for the above are within the competence of the constituent assembly   5  all inventoried agricultural property of the confiscated lands  machinery  and live stock  are transferred without compensation to the state or the community  according to their quantity and importance   the confiscation of such machinery or live stock shall not apply to the small properties of peasants   6  the right to use the land is granted to all citizens  without distinction of sex  who wish to work the land themselves  with the help of their families  or in partnership  and only so long as they are able to work  no hired labour is permitted   in the event of the incapacity for work of a member of the commune for a period of two years  the commune shall be bound to render him assistance during this time by working his land in common   farmers who through old age or sickness have permanently lost the capacity to work the land themselves  shall surrender their land and receive instead a government pension   7  the use of the land should be equalised that is to say  the land shall be divided among the workers according to local conditions  the unit of labour and the needs of the individual   the way in which land is to be used may be individually determined upon  as homesteads  as farms  by communes  by partnerships  as will be decided by the villages and settlements   8  all land upon its confiscation is pooled in the general people s land fund  its distribution among the workers is carried out by the local and central organs of administration  beginning with the village democratic organisations and ending with the central provincial institutions with the exception of urban and rural cooperative societies   the land fund is subject to periodical redistribution according to the increase of population and the development of productivity and rural economy   in case of modification of the boundaries of allotments  the original centre of the allotment remains intact   the lands of persons retiring from the community return to the land fund  providing that near relatives of the persons retiring  or friends designated by them  shall have preference in the redistribution of these lands

members of the community  deserters  etc   and finally  by drawing lots on agreement   all which is contained in this  nakaz   being the expression of the indisputable will of the great majority of conscious peasants of russia  is declared to be a temporary law  and until the convocation of the constituent assembly  becomes effective immediately so far as is possible  and in some parts of it gradually  as will be determined by the district soviets of peasants  deputies                                    4                           the land and deserters  the government was not forced to make any decision concerning the rights of deserters to the land  the end of the war and the demobilisation of the army automatically removed the deserter problem                                     5                   the council of people s commissars  the council of people s commissars was at first composed entirely of bolsheviki  this was not entirely the fault of the bolsheviki  however  on november 8th they offered portfolios to members of the left socialist revolutionaries  who declined  see page 273   of original volume                           appendix  to chapter vi                                   1                           appeals and denunciations  appeal to all citizens and to the military organisations of the socialist revolutionary party    the senseless attempt of the bolsheviki is on the eve of complete failure  the garrison is disaffected   the ministries are idle  bread is lacking  all factions except a handful of bolsheviki have left the congress of soviets  the bolsheviki are alone  abuses of all sorts  acts of vandalism and pillage  the bombardment of the winter palace  arbitrary arrests all these crimes committed by the bolsheviki have aroused against them the resentment of the majority of the sailors and soldiers  the  tsentroflot  refuses to submit to the orders of the bolsheviki     we call upon all sane elements to gather around the committee for salvation of country and revolution  to take serious measures to be ready  at the first call of the central committee of the party  to act against the counter revolutionists  who will doubtless attempt to profit by these troubles provoked by the bolshevik adventure  and to watch closely the external enemy  who also would like to take advantage of this opportune moment when the front is weakened                      the military section of the central committee of                         the socialist revolutionary party                                                       from  pravda     what is kerensky    a usurper  whose place is in peter paul prison  with kornilov and kishkin    a criminal and a traitor to the workers  soldiers and peasants  who believed in him    kerensky  a murderer of soldiers    kerensky  a public executioner of peasants    kerensky  a strangler of workers    such is the second kornilov who now wants to butcher liberty                           appendix to chapter vii                                   1                               two decrees                               on the press   in the serious decisive hour of the revolution and the days immediately following it  the provisional revolutionary committee is compelled to adopt a series of measures against the counter revolutionary press of all shades   immediately on all sides there are cries that the new socialist authority is in this violating the essential principles of its own programme by an attempt against the freedom of the press   the workers  and peasants  government calls the attention of the population to the fact that in our country  behind this liberal shield  is hidden the opportunity for the wealthier classes to seize the lion s share of the whole press  and by this means to poison the popular mind and bring confusion into the consciousness of the masses   every one knows that the bourgeois press is one of the most powerful weapons of the bourgeoisie  especially in this critical moment  when the new authority of the workers and peasants is in process of consolidation  it is impossible to leave it in the hands of the enemy  at a time when it is not less dangerous than bombs and machine guns  this is why temporary and extraordinary measures have been adopted for the purpose of stopping the flow of filth and calumny in which the yellow and green press would be glad to drown the young victory of the people   as soon as the new order is consolidated  all administrative measures against the press will be suspended  full liberty will be given it within the limits of responsibility before the law  in accordance with the broadest and most progressive regulations    bearing in mind  however  the fact that any restrictions of the freedom of the press  even in critical moments  are admissible only within the bounds of necessity  the council of people s commissars decrees as follows   1  the following classes of newspapers shall be subject to closure   a  those inciting to open resistance or disobedience to the workers  and peasants  government   b  those creating confusion by obviously and deliberately perverting the news   c  those inciting to acts of a criminal character punishable by the laws   2  the temporary or permanent closing of any organ of the press shall be carried out only by virtue of a resolution of the council of people s commissars   3  the present decree is of a temporary nature  and will be revoked by a special  ukaz  when normal conditions of public life are re established

    on workers  militia   1  all soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies shall form a workers  militia   2  this workers  militia shall be entirely at the orders of the soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies   3  military and civil authorities must render every assistance in arming the workers and in supplying them with technical equipment  even to the extent of requisitioning arms belonging to the war department of the government   4  this decree shall be promulgated by telegraph  petrograd  november 10  1917                                    people s commissar of the interior                                                   a  i  rykov   this decree encouraged the formation of companies of red guards all over russia  which became the most valuable arm of the soviet government in the ensuing civil war                                    2                           the strike fund  the fund for the striking government employees and bank clerks was subscribed by banks and business houses of petrograd and other cities  and also by foreign corporations doing business in russia  all who consented to strike against the bolsheviki were paid full wages  and in some cases their pay was increased  it was the realisation of the strike fund contributors that the bolsheviki were firmly in power  followed by their refusal to pay strike benefits  which finally broke the strike                         appendix to chapter viii                                   1                           kerensky s advance  on november 9th kerensky and his cossacks arrived at gatchina  where the garrison  hopelessly split into two factions  immediately surrendered  the members of the gatchina soviet were arrested  and at first threatened with death  later they were released on good behaviour   the cossack advance guards  practically unopposed  occupied pavlovsk  alexandrovsk and other stations  and reached the outskirts of tsarskoye selo next morning november 10th  at once the garrison divided into three groups the officers  loyal to kerenskly  part of the soldiers and non commissioned officers  who declared themselves  neutral   and most of the rank and file  who were for the bolsheviki  the bolshevik soldiers  who were without leaders or organisation  fell back toward the capital  the local soviet also withdrew to the village of pulkovo   from pulkovo six members of the tsarskoye selo soviet went with an automobile load of proclamations to gatchina  to propagandise the cossacks  they spent most of the day going around gatchina from one cossack barracks to another  pleading  arguing and explaining  toward evening some officers discovered their presence and they were arrested and brought before general krasnov  who said   you fought against kornilov  now you are opposing kerensky  i ll have you all shot    after reading aloud to them the order appointing him commander in chief of the petrograd district  krasnov asked if they were bolsheviki  they replied in the affirmative upon which krasnov went away  a short time later an officer came and set them free  saying that it was by order of general krasnov    in the meanwhile delegations continued to arrive from petrograd  from the duma  the committee for salvation  and  last of all  from the  vikzhel   the union of railway workers insisted that some agreement be reached to halt the civil war  and demanded that kerensky treat with the bolsheviki  and that he stop the advance on petrograd  in case of refusal  the  vikzhel  threatened a general strike at midnight of november 11th   kerensky asked to be allowed to discuss the matter with the socialist ministers and with the committee for salvation  he was plainly undecided   on the 11th cossack outposts reached krasnoye selo  from which the local soviet and the heterogeneous forces of the military revolutionary committee precipitately retired  some of them surrendering   that night they also touched pulkovo  where the first real resistance was encountered    cossacks deserters began to dribble into petrograd  declaring that kerensky had lied to them  that he had spread broadcast over the front proclamations which said that petrograd was burning  that the bolsheviki  had invited the germans to come in  and that they were murdering women and children and looting indiscriminately    the military revolutionary committee immediately sent out some dozens of  agitators   with thousands of printed appeals  to inform the cossacks of the real situation                                     2

insurrection of november 7th the working masses have won for the first time the real power   the all russian congress of soviets has temporarily transferred this power both to its executive committee and to the council of people s commissars   by the will of the revolutionary people  i have been appointed people s commissar of education   the work of guiding in general the people s education  inasmuch as it remains with the central government  is  until the constituent assembly meets  entrusted to a commission on the people s education  whose chairman and executive is the people s commissar   upon what fundamental propositions will rest this state commission  how is its sphere of competence determined    the general line of educational activity   every genuinely democratic power must  in the domain of education  in a country where illiteracy and ignorance reign supreme  make its first aim the struggle against this darkness  it must acquire in the shortest time  universal literacy   by organising a network of schools answering to the demands of modern pedagogics  it must introduce universal  obligatory and free tuition for all  and establish at the same time a series of such teachers  institutes and seminaries as will in the shortest time furnish a powerful army of people s teachers so necessary for the universal instruction of the population of our boundless russia    decentralisation   the state commission on people s education is by no means a central power governing the institutions of instruction and education  on the contrary  the entire school work ought to be transferred to the organs of local self government  the independent work of the workers  soldiers and peasants  establishing on their own initiative cultural educational organisations  must be given full autonomy  both by the state centre and the municipal centres   the work of the state commission serves as a link and helpmate to organise resources of material and moral support to the municipal and private institutions  particularly to those with a class character established by the workers    the state committee on people s education   a whole series of invaluable law projects was elaborated from the beginning of the revolution by the state committee for people s education  a tolerably democratic body as to its composition  and rich in experts  the state commission sincerely desires the collaboration of this committee   it has addressed itself to the bureau of the committee  with the request at once to convoke an extraordinary session of the committee for the fulfilment of the following programme   1  the revision of rules of representation in the committee  in the sense of greater democratisation   2  the revision of the committee s rights in the sense of widening them  and of converting the committee into a fundamental state institute for the elaboration of law projects calculated to reorganise public instruction and education in russia upon democratic principles   3  the revision  jointly with the new state commission  of the laws already created by the committee  a revision required by the fact that in editing them the committee had to take into account the bourgeois spirit of previous ministries  which obstructed it even in this its narrowed form   after this revision these laws will be put into effect without any bureau cratic red tape  in the revolutionary order    the pedagogues and the societists   the state commission welcomes the pedagogues to the bright and honourable work of educating the people the masters of the country   no one measure in the domain of the people s education ought to be adopted by any power without the attentive deliberation of those who represent the pedagogues   on the other hand  a decision cannot by any means be reached exclusively through the cooperation of specialists  this refers as well to reforms of the institutes of general education   the cooperation of the pedagogues with the social forces this is how the commission will work both in its own constitution  in the state committee  and in all its activities   as its first task the commission considers the improvement of the teachers  status  and first of all of those very poor though almost most important contributors to the work of culture the elementary school teachers  their just demands ought to be satisfied at once and at any cost  the proletariat of the schools has in vain demanded an increase of salary to one hundred rubles per month  it would be a disgrace any longer to keep in poverty the teachers of the overwhelming majority of the russian people   but a real democracy cannot stop at mere literacy  at universal elementary instruction  it must endeavour to organise a uniform secular school of several grades  the ideal is  equal and if possible higher education for all the citizens  so long as this idea has not been realised for all  the natural transition through all the schooling grades up to the university a transition to a higher stage must depend entirely upon the pupil s aptitude  and not upon the resources of his family   the problem of a genuinely democratic organisation of instruction is particularly difficult in a country impoverished by a long  criminal  imperialistic war  but the workers who have taken the power must remember that education will serve them as the greatest instrument in their struggle for a better lot and for a spiritual growth  however needful it may be to curtail other articles of the people s budget  the expenses on education must stand high  a large educational budget is the pride and glory of a nation  the free and enfranchised peoples of russia will not forget this   the fight against illiteracy and ignorance cannot be confined to a thorough establishment of school education for children and youths  adults  too  will be anxious to save themselves from the debasing position of a man who cannot read and write  the school for adults must occupy a conspicuous place in the general plan of popular instruction    instruction and education   one must emphasise the difference between instruction and education   instruction is the transmission of ready knowledge by the teacher to his pupil  education is a creative process  the personality of the individual is being  educated  throughout life  is being formed  grows richer in content  stronger and more perfect   the toiling masses of the people the workmen  the peasants  the soldiers are thirsting for elementary and advanced instruction  but they are also thirsting for education  neither the government nor the intellectuals nor any other power outside of themselves can give it to them  the school  the book  the theatre  the museum  etc   may here by only aids  they have their own ideas  formed by their social position  so different from the position of those ruling classes and intellectuals who have hitherto created culture  they have their own ideas  their own emotions  their own ways of approaching the problems of personality and society  the city labourer  according to his own fashion  the rural toiler according to his  will each build his clear world conception permeated with the class idea  of the workers  there is no more superb or beautiful phenomenon than the one of which our nearest descendants will be both witnesses and participants  the building by collective labour of its own general  rich and free soul   instruction will surely be an important but not a decisive element  what is more important here is the criticism  the creativeness of the masses themselves  for science and art have only in some of their parts a general human importance  they suffer radical changes with every far reaching class upheaval   throughout russia  particularly among the city labourers  but also among the peasants  a powerful wave of cultural educational movement has arisen  workers  and soldiers  organisations of this kind are multiplying rapidly  to meet them  to lend them support  to clear the road before them is the first task of a revolutionary and popular government in the domain of democratic education    the constituent assembly  will doubtless soon begin its work  it alone can permanently establish the order of national and social life in our country  and at the same time the general character of the organisation of popular education   now  however  with the passage of power to the soviets  the really democratic character of the constituent assembly is assured  the line which the state commission  relying upon the state committee  will follow  will hardly suffer any modification under the influence of the constituent assembly  without pre determining it  the new people s government considers itself within its rights in enacting in this domain a series of measures which aim at enriching and enlightening as soon as possible the spiritual life of the country    the ministry   the present work must in the interim proceed through the ministry of the people s education  of all the necessary alterations in its composition and construction the state commission will have charge  elected by the executive committee of the soviets and the state committee  of course the order of state authority in the domain of the people s education will be established by the constituent assembly  until then  the ministry must play the part of the executive apparatus for both the state committee and the state commission for people s education   the pledge of the country s safety lies in the cooperation of all its vital and genuinely democratic forces   we believe that the energetic effort of the working people and of the honest enlightened intellectuals will lead the country out of its painful crisis  and through complete democracy to the reign of socialism and the brotherhood of nations                                    people s commissar on education

notify the president of the committee of the finland guard regiment  concerning the amount of wine in their premises   those who violate this order will be arrested and given trial before a merciless

kerensky sent a proposition to the revolutionary troops  to lay down their arms   kerensky s men opened artillery fire  our artillery answered and compelled the enemy to be silent  the cossacks assumed the offensive  the deadly fire of the sailors  the red guards and the soldiers forced the cossacks to retreat  our armoured cars rushed in among the ranks of the enemy  the enemy is fleeing  our troops are in pursuit  the order has been given to arrest kerensky  tsarskoye selo has been taken by the revolutionary troops    the lettish riflemen   the military revolutionary committee has received precise information that the valiant lettish riflemen have arrived from the front and taken up a position in the rear of kerensky s bands    from the staff of the military revolutionary committee   the seizure of gatchina and tsarskoye selo by kerensky s detachments is to be explained by the complete absence of artillery and machine guns in these places  whereas kerensky s cavalry was provided with artillery from the beginning  the last two days were days of enforced work for our staff  to provide the necessary quantity of guns  machine guns  field telephones  etc   for the revolutionary troops  when this work with the energetic assistance of the district soviets and the factories  the putilov works  obukhov and others  was accomplished  the issue of the expected encounter left no place for doubt  on the side of the revolutionary troops there was not only a surplus in quantity and such a powerful material base as petrograd  but also an enormous moral advantage  all the petrograd regiments moved out to the positions with tremendous enthusiasm  the garrison conference elected a control commission of five soldiers  thus securing a complete unity between the commander in chief and the garrison  at the garrison conference it was unanimously decided to begin decisive action   the artillery fire on the 12th of november developed with extraordinary force by 3 p m  the cossacks were completely demoralised  a parliamentarian came from them to the staff of the detachment at krasnoye selo  and proposed to stop the firing  threatening otherwise to take  decisive  measures  he was answered that the firing would cease when kerensky laid down his arms   in the developing encounter all sections of the troops the sailors  soldiers and the red guards showed unlimited courage  the sailors continued to advance until they had fired all their cartridges  the number of casualties has not been established yet  but it is larger on the part of the counter revolutionary troops  who experienced great losses through one of our armoured cars   kerensky s staff  fearing that they would be surrounded  gave the order to retreat  which retreat speedily assumed a disorderly character  by 11 12 p m   tsarkoye selo  including the wireless station  was entirely occupied by the troops of the soviets  the cossacks retreated towards gatchina and colpinno   the morale of the troops is beyond all praise  the order has been given to pursue the retreating cossacks  from the tsarskoye selo station a radio telegram was sent immediately to the front and to all local soviets throughout russia  further details will be communicated                                     2                       events of the 13th in petrograd  three regiments of the petrograd garrison to take any part in the battle against kerensky  on the morning of the 13th they summoned to a joint conference sixty delegates from the front  in order to find some way to stop the civil war  this conference appointed a committee to go and persuade kerensky s troops to lay down their arms  they proposed to ask the government soldiers the following questions   1  will the soldiers and cossacks of kerensky recognise the  tsay ee kah  as the repository of governmental power  responsible to the congress of soviets   2  will the soldiers and cossacks accept the decrees of the second congress of soviets   3  will they accept the land and peace decrees   4  will they agree to cease hostilities and return to their units   5  will they consent to the arrest of kerensky  krasnov and savinkov   at the meeting of the petrograd soviet  zinoviev said   it would be foolish to think that this committee could finish affair  the enemy can only be broken by force  however  it would be a crime for us not to try every peaceful means to bring the cossacks over to us   what we need is a military victory   the news of an armistice is premature  our staff will be ready to conclude an armistice when the enemy can no longer do any harm     at present  the influence of our victory is creating new political conditions   to day the socialist revolutionaries are inclined are inclined to admit the bolsheviki into the new government   a decisive victory is indispensable  so that those who hesitate will have no further hesitation     at the city duma all attention was concentrated on the formation of the new government  in many factories and barracks already revolutionary tribunals were operating  and the bolsheviki were threatening to set up more of these  and try gotz and avksentiev before them  dan proposed that an ultimatum be sent demanding the abolition of these revolutionary tribunals  or the other members of the conference would immediately break off all negotiations with the bolsheviki   shingariov  cadet  declared that the municipality ought not to take part in any agreement with the bolsheviki    any agreement with the maniacs is impossible until they lay down their arms and recognise the authority of independent courts of law     yartsev  for the  yedinstvo  group  declared that any agreement with the bolsheviki would be equivalent to a bolshevik victory    mayor schreider  for the socialist revolutionaries  stated that he was opposed to all agreement with the bolsheviki    as for a government  that ought to spring from the popular will  and since the popular will has been expressed in the municipal elections  the popular will which can create a government is actually concentrated in the duma     after other speakers  of which only the representative of the mensheviki internationalists was in favour of considering the admission of the bolsheviki into the new government  the duma voted to continue its representatives in the  vikzhel s  conference  but to insist upon the restoration of the provisional government before everything  and to exclude the bolsheviki from the new power                                     3           truce  krasnov s answer to the committee for salvation   in answer to your telegram proposing an immediate armistice  the supreme commander  not wishing further futile bloodshed  consents to enter into negotiations and to establish relations between the armies of the government and the insurrectionists  he proposes to the general staff of the insurrectionists to recall its regiments to petrograd  to declare the line ligovo pulkovo colpinno neutral  and to allow the advance guards of the government cavalry to enter tsarskoye selo  for the purpose of establishing order  the answer to this proposal must be placed in the hands of our envoys before eight o clock to morrow morning                                                   krasnov                                     4                           events at tsarskoye selo  on the evening that kerensky s troops retreated from tsarskoye selo  some priests organised a religious procession through the streets of the town  making speeches to the citizens in which they asked the people to support the rightful authority  the provisional government  when the cossacks had retreated  and the first red guards entered the town  witnesses reported that the priests had incited the people against the soviets  and had said prayers at the grave of rasputin  which lies behind the imperial palace  one of the priests  father ivan kutchurov  was arrested and shot by the infuriated red guards    just as the red guards entered the town the electric lights were shut off  plunging the streets in complete darkness  the director of the electric light plant  lubovitch  was arrested by the soviet troops and asked why he had shut off the lights  he was found some time later in the room where he had been imprisoned with a revolver in his hand and a bullet hole in his temple   the petrograd anti bolshevik papers came out next day with headlines   plekhanov s temperature 39 degrees   plekhanov lived at tsarskoye selo  where he was lying ill in bed  red guards arrived at the house and searched it for arms  questioning the old man    what class of society do you belong to   they asked him    i am a revolutionist   answered plekhanov   who for forty years has devoted his life to the struggle for liberty     anyway   said a workman   you have now sold yourself to the bourgeoisie    the workers no longer knew plekhanov

their arms and decided to arrest kerensky  that chief of the counter revolutionary campaign has fled  the army  by an enormous majority  has pronounced in favour of the second all russian congress of soviets  and of the government which it has created  scores of delegates from the front have hastened to petrograd to assure the soviet government of the army s fidelity  no twisting of the facts  no

occupied occasionally by receptions of one of the grand duchesses  had served as barracks for the  yunkers   it was not only bombarded  but pretty well sacked  fortunately there was nothing in it of particular historical value   usspensky cathedral had a shell hole in one of the cupolas  but except for a few feet of mosaic in the ceiling  was undamaged  the frescoes on the porch of blagovestchensky cathedral were badly damaged by a shell  another shell hit the corner of ivan veliki  tchudovsky monastery was hit about thirty times  but only one shell went through a window into

negotiations with the allies  the negotiations and armistice with the germans  and the beginning of the peace negotiations at brest litovsk  as well as the period in which were laid the foundations of the soviet state   however  it is no part of my purpose in this book to describe and interpret these very important historical events  which require more space  they are therefore reserved for another volume   kornilov to brest litovsk    in this chapter  then  i have confined myself to the soviet government s attempts to consolidate its political power at home  and sketched its successive conquests of hostile domestic elements which process was temporarily interrupted by the disastrous peace of brest litovsk                                    2           preamble declaration of the rights of the peoples of russia  the october revolution of the workers and peasants began under the common banner of emancipation   the peasants are being emancipated from the power of the landowners  for there is no longer the landowner s property right in the land it has been abolished  the soldiers and sailors are being emancipated from the power of autocratic generals  for generals will henceforth be elective and subject to recall  the workingmen are being emancipated from the whims and arbitrary will of the capitalists  for henceforth there will be established the control of the workers over mills and factories  everything living and capable of life is being emancipated from the hateful shackles   there remain only the peoples of russia  who have suffered and are suffering oppression and arbitrariness  and whose emancipation must immediately be begun  whose liberation must be effected resolutely and definitely   during the period of tsarism the peoples of russia were systematically incited against one another  the result of such a policy are known  massacres and  pogroms  on the one hand  slavery of peoples on the other   there can be and there must be no return to this disgraceful policy  henceforth the policy of a voluntary and honest union of the peoples of russia must be substituted   in the period of imperialism  after the march revolution  when the power was transferred into the hands of the cadet bourgeoisie  the naked policy of provocation gave way to one of cowardly distrust of the peoples of russia  to a policy of fault finding  of

representatives of the  tsay ee kah   of the municipal duma  of the avksentiev peasants  soviets  and of all the political parties from the bolsheviki to the populist socialists  were invited to the meeting   after long deliberation  having heard the declarations of all parties and organisations  the meeting by a tremendous majority of votes agreed that only the bolsheviki and the left socialist revolutionaries are for the people  and that all the other parties are only attempting  under cover of seeking an agreement  to deprive the people of the conquests won in the days of the great workers  and peasants  revolution of november   here is the text of the resolution carried at this meeting of the petrograd garrison  by 61 votes against 11  and 12 not voting    the garrison conference

definitely that they stand for a government of the soviets  for the decrees on land  peace and workers  control of industry  and that upon this platform they are willing to agree with all the socialist parties    2  at the same time the representatives of the other parties  mensheviki  socialist revolutionaries  either gave no answer at all  or declared simply that they were opposed to the power of the soviets and against the decrees on land  peace and workers  control    in view of this the meeting resolves     1  to express severe censure of all parties which  under cover of an agreement  wish practically to annul the popular conquests of the revolution of november    2  to express full confidence in the  tsay ee kah  and the council of people s commissars  and to promise

                          wine  pogroms   it was afterward discovered that there was a regular organisation  maintained by the cadets  for provoking rioting among the soldiers  there would be telephone messages to the different barracks  announcing that wine was being given away at such and such an address  and when the soldiers arrived at the spot an individual would point out the location of the cellar    the council of people s commissars appointed a commissar for the fight against drunkenness  who  besides mercilessly putting down the wine riots  destroyed hundreds of thousands of bottles of liquor  the winter palace cellars  containing rare vintages valued at more than five million dollars  were at first flooded  and then the liquor was removed to cronstadt and

saved except by creating regiments of officers and  yunkers   attacking with these regiments  and having gained a first success  we could later gain the aid of the garrison troops  but without that first success it is impossible to count on a single soldier  because thousands of them are divided and terrorised by the scum which exists in every regiment  most of the cossacks are tainted by bolshevik propaganda  thanks to the strange policy of general dutov  who allowed to pass the moment when by decisive action something could have been obtained  the policy of negotiations and concessions has borne its fruits  all that is respectable is persecuted  and it is the  plebe  and the criminals who dominate and nothing can be done except by shooting and hanging them    we are awaiting you here  general  and at the moment of your arrival  we shall advance with all the forces at our disposal  but for that we must establish some communication with you  and before all  clear up the following points     1  do you know that in your name all officers who could take part in the fight are being invited to leave petrograd on the pretext of joining you     2  about when can we count on your arrival at petrograd  we should like to know in order to coordinate our actions    in spite of the criminal inaction of the conscious people here  which allowed the yoke of bolshevism to be laid upon us in spite of the extraordinary pig headedness of the majority of officers  so difficult to organise  we believe in spite of all that truth is on our side  and that we shall conquer the vicious and criminal forces who say that they are acting for motives of love of country and in order to save it  whatever comes  we shall not permit ourselves to be struck down  and shall remain firm

appeals   from the employees of the state and private banks to the population of petrograd     comrades workers  soldiers and citizens    the military revolutionary committee in an  extraordinary notice  is accusing the workers of the state and private banking and other institutions of  impeding the work of the government  directed towards the ensuring of the front with provisions     comrades and citizens  do not believe this calumny  brought against us  who are part of the general army of labour    however difficult it be for us to work under the constant threat of interference by acts of violence in our hard working life  however depressing it be to know that our country and the revolution are on the verge of ruin  we  nevertheless  all of us  from the highest to the lowest  employees   artelshtchiki   counters  labourers  couriers  etc   are continuing to fulfil our duties which are connected with the ensuring of provisions and munitions to the front and country    counting upon your lack of information  comrades workers and soldiers  in questions of finance and banking  you are being incited against workers like yourselves  because it is desirable to divert the responsibility for the starving and dying brother soldiers at the front from the guilty persons to the innocent workers who are accomplishing their duty under the burden of general poverty and disorganisation    remember  workers and soldiers  the employees have always stood up for and will always stand up for the interests of the toiling people  part of which they are themselves  and not a single kopek necessary for the front and the workers has ever been detained and will not be detained by the employees    from november 6th to november 23d  i e   during 17 days  500 million rubles were dispatched to the front  and 120 millions to moscow  besides the sums sent to other towns    keeping guard over the wealth of the people  the master of which can be only the constituent assembly  representing the whole nation  the employees refuse to give out money for purposes which are unknown to them    do not believe the calumniators calling you to take the law into your own hands

                             to the population of petrograd     citizens  do not believe the falsehood which irresponsible people are trying to suggest to you by spreading terrible calumnies against the employees of the ministry of supplies and the workers in other supply organisations who are labouring in these dark days for the salvation of russia  citizens  in posted placards you are called upon to lynch us  we are accused falsely of sabotage and strikes  we are blamed for all the woes and misfortunes that the people are suffering  although we have been striving indefatigably and uninterruptedly  and are still striving  to save the russian people from the horrors of starvation  notwithstanding all that we are bearing as citizens of unhappy russia  we have not for one hour abandoned our heavy and responsible work of supplying the army and population with provisions    the image of the army  cold and hungry  saving our very existence by its blood and its tortures  does not leave us for a single moment    citizens  if we have survived the blackest days in the life and history of our people  if we have succeeded in preventing famine in petrograd  if we have managed to procure to the suffering army bread and forage by means of enormous  almost superhuman  efforts  it is because we have honestly continued and are still continuing to do our work     to the  last warning  of the usurpers of the power we reply  it is not for you who are leading the country to ruin to threaten us who are doing all we can not to allow the country to perish  we are not afraid of threats  before us stands the sacred image of tortured russia  we will continue our work of supplying the army and the people with bread to our last efforts  so long as you will not prevent us from accomplishing our duty to our country  in the contrary case the army and the people will stand before the horrors of famine  but the responsibility therefor belongs to the perpetrators of violence

for having failed to report for work on the day fixed  and who have nevertheless received their salary paid in advance for the time they have not served  are bound to return such salary not later than on november 27th  1917  to those institutions where they were in service   in the event of this not being done  these persons will be rendered answerable for stealing the treasury s property and tried

board for the supplies  citizens   the conditions of our work for the supplying of petrograd are getting more and more difficult every day    the interference with our work which is so ruinous to our business of the commissars of the military revolutionary committee is still continuing    their arbitrary acts  their annulling of our orders  may lead to a catastrophe    seals have been affixed to one of the cold storages where the meat and butter destined for the population are kept  and we cannot regulate the temperature so that the products would not be spoilt    one carload of potatoes and one carload of cabbages have been seized and carried away no one knows where to    cargoes which are not liable to requisition   khalva   are requisitioned by the commissars and  as was the case one day  five boxes of  khalva  were seized by the commissar for his own use    we are not in a position to dispose of our storages  where the selfappointed commissars do not allow the cargoes to be taken out  and terrorise our employees  threatening them with arrest    all that is going on in petrograd is known in the provinces  and from the don  from siberia  from voronezh and other places people are refusing to send flour and bread    this cannot go on much longer    the work is simply falling out of our hands    our duty is to let the population know of this    to the last possibility we will remain on guard of the interests of the population    we will do everything to avoid the oncoming famine  but if under these difficult conditions our work is compelled to stop  let the people know that it is not our fault                                     15   elections to the constituent assembly in petrograd  there were nineteen tickets in petrograd  the results are as follows  published

you are told that the soviets of workers   soldiers  and peasants  deputies are your enemies  that they want to take away your cossack land  your cossack  liberty   don t believe it  cossacks   your own generals and landowners are deceiving you  in order to keep you in darkness and slavery   we  the council of people s commissars  address ourselves to you  cossacks  with these words  read them attentively and judge yourselves which is the truth and which is cruel deceit  the life and service of a cossack were always bondage and penal servitude  at the first call of the authorities a cossack always had to saddle his horse and ride out on campaign  all his military equipment a cossack had to provide with his own hardly earned means  a cossack is on service  his farm is going to rack and ruin  is such a condition fair  no  it must be altered for ever  the cossacks must be freed from bondage  the new people s soviet power is willing to come to the assistance of the toiling cossacks  it is only necessary that the cossacks themselves should resolve to abolish the old order  that they should refuse submission to their slave driver officers  land owners  rich men  that they should throw off the cursed yoke from their necks  arise  cossacks  unite  the council of people s commissars calls upon you to enter a new  fresh  more happy life    in november and december in petrograd there were all russian congresses of soviets of soldiers   workers   and peasants  deputies  these congresses transferred all the authority in the different localities into the hands of the soviets  i e   into the hands of men elected by the people  from now on there must be in russia no rulers or functionaries who command the people from above and drive them  the people create the authority themselves  a general has no more rights than a soldier  all are equal  consider  cossacks  is this wrong or right  we are calling upon you  cossacks  to join this new order and to create your own soviets of cossacks  deputies  to such soviets all the power must belong in the different localities  not to  hetmans  with the rank of general  but to the elected representatives of the toiling cossacks  to your own trustworthy reliable men    the all russian congresses of soldiers   workers   and peasants  deputies have passed a resolution to transfer all landowners  land into the possession of the toiling people  is not that fair  cossacks  the kornilovs  kaledins  dutovs  karaulovs  bardizhes  all defend with their whole souls the interests of the rich men  and they are ready to drown russia in blood if only the lands remain in the hands of the landowners  but you  the toiling cossacks  do not you suffer yourselves from poverty  oppression and lack of land  how many cossacks are there who have more than 4 5  dessiatins  per head  but the landowners  who have thousands of  dessiatins  of their own land  wish besides to get into their hands the lands of the cossack army  according to the new soviet laws  the lands of cossack landowners must pass without compensation into the hands of the cossack workers  the poorer cossacks  you are being told that the soviets wish to take away your lands from you  who is frightening you  the rich cossacks  who know that the soviet authority wishes to transfer the landowners  lands to you  choose then  cossacks  for whom will you stand  for the kornilovs and kaledins  for the generals and rich men  or for the soviets of peasants   soldiers   workers  and cossacks  deputies    the council of people s commissars elected by the all russian congress has proposed to all nations an immediate armistice and an honourable democratic peace without loss or detriment to any nation  all the capitalists  landowners  generals kornilovists have risen against the peaceful policy of the soviets  the war was bringing them profits  power  distinctions  and to you  cossack privates  you were perishing without reason  without purpose  like your brothers soldiers and sailors  it will soon be three years and a half that this accursed war has gone on  a war devised by the capitalists and landowners of all countries for their own profit  their world robberies  to the toiling cossacks the war has only brought ruin and death  the war has drained all the resources from cossack farm life  the only salvation for the whole of our country and for the cossacks in  particular is a prompt and honest peace  the council of people s commissars has declared to all governments and peoples  we do not want other people s property  and we do not wish to give away our own  peace without annexations and without indemnities  every nation must decide its own fate  there must be no oppressing of one nation by another  such is the honest  democratic  people s peace which the council of people s commissars is proposing to all governments  to all peoples  allies and enemies  and the results are visible  on the russian front an armistice has been concluded    the soldier s and the cossack s blood is not flowing there any more  now  cossacks  decide  do you wish to continue this ruinous  senseless  criminal slaughter  then support the cadets  the enemies of the people  support tchernov  tseretelli  skobeliev  who drove you into the offensive of july 1st  support kornilov  who introduced capital punishment for soldiers and cossacks at the front  but if you wish a prompt and honest peace  then enter the ranks of the soviets and support the council of people s commissars    your fate  cossacks  lies in your own hands  our common foes  the landowners  capitalists  officers kornilovists  bourgeois newspapers  are deceiving you and driving you along the road to ruin  in orenburg  dutov has arrested the soviet and disarmed the garrison  kaledin is threatening the soviets in the province of the don  he has declared the province to be in a state of war and is assembling his troops  karaulov is shooting the local tribes in the caucasus  the cadet bourgeoisie is supplying them with its millions  their common aim is to suppress the people s soviets  to crush the workers and peasants  to introduce again the discipline of the whip in the army  and to eternalise the bondage of the toiling cossacks    our revolutionary troops are moving to the don and the ural in order to put an end to this criminal revolt against the people  the commanders of the revolutionary troops have received orders not to enter into any negotiations with the mutinous generals  to act decisively and mercilessly    cossacks  on you depends now whether your brothers  blood is to flow still  we are holding out our hand to you  join the whole people against its enemies  declare kaledin  kornilov  dutov  karaulov and all their aiders and abettors to be the enemies of the people  traitors and betrayers  arrest them with your own forces and turn them over into the hands of the soviet authority  which will judge them in open and public revolutionary tribunal  cossacks  form soviets of cossacks  deputies  take into your toil worn hands the management of all the affairs of the cossacks  take away the lands of your own wealthy landowners  take over their grain  their inventoried property and live stock for the cultivation of the lands of the toiling cossacks  who are ruined by the war    forward  cossacks  to the fight for the common cause of the people    long live the toiling cossacks    long live the union of the cossacks  the soldiers  peasants and workers    long live the power of the soviets of cossacks   soldiers   workers  and

the full powered congress of peasants  soviets met about a week later  and continued for several weeks  its history is merely an expanded version of the history of the  extraordinary conference   at first the great majority of the delegates were hostile to the soviet government  and supported the reactionary wing  several days later the assembly was supporting the moderates with tchernov  and several days after that the vast majority of the congress were voting for the faction of maria spiridonova  and sending their representatives into the  tsay ee kah  at smolny   the right wing then walked out of the congress and called a congress of its own  which went on  dwindling from day to day  until it finally dissolved             the junior classics  selected and arranged by  william patten  managing editor of the harvard classics  introduction by charles w  eliot  ll d   president emeritus of harvard university  with a reading guide by william allan neilson  ph  d   professor of english  harvard university  president smith college  northampton  mass   since 1917     volume one  fairy and wonder tales     introduction  the purpose of the junior classics is to provide  in ten volumes containing about five thousand pages  a classified collection of tales  stories  and poems  both ancient and modern  suitable for boys and girls of from six to sixteen years of age   thoughtful parents and teachers  who realize the evils of indiscriminate reading on the part of children  will appreciate the educational value of such a collection   a child s taste in reading is formed  as a rule  in the first ten or twelve years of its life  and experience has shown that the childish mind will prefer good literature to any other  if access to it is made easy  and will develop far better on literature of proved merit than on trivial or transitory material   the boy or girl who becomes familiar with the charming tales and poems in this collection will have gained a knowledge of literature and history that will be of high value in other school and home work   here are the real elements of imaginative narration  poetry  and ethics  which should enter into the education of every english speaking child   this collection  carefully used by parents and teachers with due reference to individual tastes and needs  will make many children enjoy good literature   it will inspire them with a love of good reading  which is the best possible result of any elementary education   the child himself should be encouraged to make his own selections from this large and varied collection  the child s enjoyment being the object in view   a real and lasting interest in literature or in scholarship is only to be developed through the individual s enjoyment of his mental occupations   the most important change which has been made in american schools and colleges within my memory is the substitution of leading for driving  of inspiration for drill  of personal interest and love of work for compulsion and fear   the schools are learning to use methods and materials which interest and attract the children themselves   the junior classics will put into the home the means of using this happy method   committing to memory beautiful pieces of literature  either prose or poetry  for recitation before a friendly audience  acting charades or plays  and reading aloud with vivacity and sympathetic emotion  are good means of instruction at home or at school this collection contains numerous admirable pieces of literature for such use   in teaching english and english literature we should place more reliance upon processes and acts which awaken emotion  stimulate interest  prove to be enjoyable for the actors  and result in giving children the power of entertaining people  of blessing others with noble pleasures which the children create and share    from the home training during childhood there should result in the child a taste for interesting and improving reading which will direct and inspire its subsequent intellectual life   the training which results in this taste for good reading  however unsystematic or eccentric it may have been  has achieved one principal aim of education  and any school or home training which does not result in implanting this permanent taste has failed in a very important respect  guided and animated by this impulse to acquire knowledge and exercise the imagination through good reading  the adult will continue to educate him all through life   the story of the human race through all its slow development should be gradually conveyed to the child s mind from the time he begins to read  or to listen to his mother reading  and with description of facts and actual events should be mingled charming and uplifting products of the imagination   to try to feed the minds of children upon facts alone is undesirable and unwise   the immense product of the imagination in art and literature is a concrete fact with which every educated human being should be made somewhat familiar  that product being a very real part of every individual s actual environment   the right selection of reading matter for children is obviously of high importance   some of the mythologies  old testament stories  fairy tales  and historical romances  on which earlier generations were accustomed to feed the childish mind  contain a great deal that is barbarous  perverse  or cruel  and to this infiltration into children s minds  generation after generation  of immoral  cruel  or foolish ideas is probably to be attributed in part the slow ethical progress of the race   the commonest justification of this thoughtless practice is that children do not apprehend the evil in the bad mental pictures with which we foolishly supply them  but what should we think of a mother who gave her children dirty milk or porridge  on the theory that the children would not assimilate the dirt   should we be less careful about mental and moral food materials   the junior classics have been selected with this principle in mind  without losing sight of the fact that every developing human being needs to have a vision of the rough and thorny road over which the human race has been slowly advancing during thousands of years   whoever has committed to memory in childhood such bible extracts as genesis i  the ten commandments  psalm xxiii  matthew v  8 12  the lord s prayer  and i corinthians xiii  such english prose as lincoln s gettysburg speech  bacon s  essay on truth   and such poems as bryant s  waterfowl   addison s  divine ode   milton s sonnet on his blindness  wotton s  how happy is he born or taught   emerson s  rhodora   holmes s  chambered nautilus   and gray s elegy  and has stamped them on his brain by frequent repetition  will have set up in his mind high standards of noble thought and feeling  true patriotism  and pure religion   he will also have laid in an invaluable store of good english   while the majority of the tales and poems are intended for children who have begun to do their own reading  there will be found in every volume selections fit for reading aloud to younger children   throughout the collection the authors tell the stories in their own words  so that the salt which gave them savor is preserved   there are some condensations however  such as any good teller of borrowed stories would make  but as a rule condensation has been applied only in the case of long works which otherwise could not have been included   the notes which precede the condensations supply explanations  and answer questions which experience has shown boys and girls are apt to ask about the works condensed or their authors   the junior classics constitute a set of books whose contents will delight children and at the same time satisfy the legitimate ethical requirements of those who have the children s best interests at heart   charles w  eliot  note  notices

wore seven league boots  sleeping beauty  from the painting by edmund dulac  preface  there are some things in this world we can get along without  but  the experience of many thousand years has shown us that the fairy tale is not one of them   there must have been fairy tales  or fables  or folk tales  or myths  or whatever name we choose to give them  ever since the world began   they are not exclusively french  german  greek  russian  indian or chinese  but are the common property of the whole human family and are as universal as human speech   all the world over  fairy tales are found to be pretty much the same  the story of cinderella is found in all countries   japan has a rip van winkle  china has a beauty and the beast  egypt has a puss in boots  and persia has a jack and the beanstalk   those wise people who have made a careful study of literature  and especially of what we call folk tales or fairy tales or fables or myths  tell us that they all typify in some way the constant struggle that is going on in every department of life   it may be the struggle of summer against winter  the bright day against dark night  innocence against cruelty  of knowledge against ignorance   we are not obliged to think of these delightful stories as each having a meaning   our enjoyment of them will not be less if we overlook that side  but it may help us to understand and appreciate good books if we remember that the literature of the world is the story of man s struggle against nature  that the beginnings of literature came out of the mouths of story  tellers  and that the stories they told were fairy tales imaginative stories based on truth   there is one important fact to remember in connection with the old fairy tales  and that is that they were repeated aloud from memory  not read from a book or manuscript   the printing of books from type may be said to date from the year 1470  when caxton introduced printing into england   it is said that the first book printed in english which had the pages numbered was a book of tales   aesop s fables    as late as 1600 printed books were still so rare that only rich men could own them   there was one other way of printing a story on sheepskin  split and made into parchment  with a pen but that was a long and laborious art that could only be practiced by educated men who had been taught to write   the monks were about the only men who had the necessary education and time  and they cared more for making copies of the bible and lives of the saints than they did of fairy tales   the common people  and even kings and queens  were therefore obliged to depend upon the professional story teller   fairy tales were very popular in the middle ages   in the long winter months fields could not be cultivated  traveling had to be abandoned  and all were kept within doors by the cold and snow   we know what the knight s house looked like in those days   the large beamed hail or living room was the principal room   at one end of it  on a low platform  was a table for the knight  his family  and any visiting knights and ladies   at the other tables on the main floor were the armed men  like squires and retainers  who helped defend the castle from attack  and the maids of the household   the story teller  who was sometimes called a bard or skald or minstrel  had his place of honor in the center of the room  and when the meal was over he was called upon for a story   these story tellers became very expert in the practice of their art  and some of them could arouse their audiences to a great pitch of excitement   in the note that precedes the story  the treason of ganelon   in the volume  heroes and heroines of chivalry   you can see how one of these story tellers  or minstrels  sang aloud a story to the soldiers of william the conqueror to encourage them as he led them into battle   the fairy tales collected by the brothers grimm were first published in 1812   they spent thirteen years collecting them  writing them down as they were told by the peasants in hesse  a mountainous province of germany lying far removed from the great main roads   their friends helped them  but their best friend was the wife of a cowherd  a strong  intelligent woman of fifty  who had a perfect genius for storytelling   she knew she told the stories well  and that not many had her gift   the grimms said that though she repeated a story for them three times  the variations were so slight as to be hardly apparent   the american indian stories of manabozho the mischief maker and his adventures with the wolf and the woodpeckers and the ducks were collected in very much the same way by henry r  schoolcraft  1793  1864   the explorer and traveler  who lived among the indian tribes for thirty years   mrs  steel has told us how she collected her hindu stories  often listening over and over to poor story tellers who would spoil a story in trying to tell it  until one day her patience would be rewarded by hearing it from the lips of the best storyteller in the village  who was generally a boy   as all nations have their fairy tales  you will find in this collection examples of english  irish  french  german  scandinavian  icelandic  russian  polish  serbian  spanish  arabian  hindu  chinese  and japanese fairy tales  as well as those recited around the lodge fires at night by american indians for the entertainment of the red children of the west   i hope the work may prove for many a boy and girl  of any age up to a hundred  the golden bridge over which they can plunge into that marvelous world of fairies  elves  goblins  kobolds  trolls  afreets  jinns  ogres  and giants that fascinates us all  lost to this world till some one wakes us up to say  bedtime    such excursions fill the mind with beautiful fancies and help to develop that most precious of our faculties  the imagination   william patten   manabozho  the mischief maker  adapted from h  r  schoolcraft  there was never in the whole world a more mischievous busybody than that notorious giant manabozho   he was everywhere  in season and out of season  running about  and putting his hand in whatever was going forward   to carry on his game he could take almost any shape he pleased   he could be very foolish or very wise  very weak or very strong  very rich or very poor just as happened to suit his humor best   whatever anyone else could do  he would attempt without a moment s reflection   he was a match for any man he met  and there were few manitoes     good spirits or evil spirits  that could get the better of him   by turns he would be very kind or very cruel  an animal or a bird  a man or a spirit  and yet  in spite of all these gifts  manabozho was always getting himself involved in all sorts of troubles   more than once  in the course of his adventures  was this great maker of mischief driven to his wits  ends to come off with his life   to begin at the beginning  manabozho  while yet a youngster  was living with his grandmother near the edge of a great prairie   it was on this prairie that he first saw animals and birds of every kind  he also there made first acquaintance with thunder and lightning   he would sit by the hour watching the clouds as they rolled by  musing on the shades of light and darkness as the day rose and fell   for a stripling  manabozho was uncommonly wide awake   every sight he beheld in the heavens was a subject of remark  every new animal or bird an object of deep interest  and every sound was like a new lesson which he was expected to learn   he often trembled at what he heard and saw   the first sound he heard was that of the owl  at which he was greatly terrified  and  quickly descending the tree he had climbed  he ran with alarm to the lodge    noko  noko  grandmother   he cried    i have heard a monedo    she laughed at his fears  and asked him what kind of a noise it made  he answered    it makes a noise like this  ko ko ko ho    his grandmother told him he was young and foolish  that what he heard was only a bird which derived its name from the peculiar noise it made   he returned to the prairie and continued his watch   as he stood there looking at the clouds he thought to himself   it is singular that i am so simple and my grandmother so wise  and that i have neither father nor mother   i have never heard a word about them   i must ask and find out    he went home and sat down  silent and dejected   finding that this did not attract the notice of his grandmother  he began a loud lamentation  which he kept increasing  louder and louder  till it shook the lodge and nearly deafened the old grandmother    manabozho  what is the matter with you   she said   you are making a great deal of noise    manabozho started off again with his doleful hubbub  but succeeded in jerking out between his big sobs   i haven t got any father nor mother  i haven t    knowing that he was of a wicked and revengeful nature  his grandmother dreaded to tell him the story of his parentage  as she knew he would make trouble of it   manabozho renewed his cries and managed to throw out for a third or fourth time  his sorrowful lament that he was a poor unfortunate who had no parents or relatives   at last she said to him  to quiet him   yes  you have a father and three brothers living   your mother is dead   she was taken for a wife by your father  the west  without the consent of her parents   your brothers are the north  east  and south  and being older than you your father has given them great power with the winds  according to their names   you are the youngest of his children   i have nursed you from your infancy  for your mother died when you were born     i am glad my father is living   said manabozho   i shall set out in the morning to visit him    his grandmother would have discouraged him  saying it was a long distance to the place where his father  ningabinn  or the west  lived   this information seemed rather to please than to discourage manabozho  for by this time he had grown to such a size and strength that he had been compelled to leave the narrow shelter of his grandmother s lodge and live out of doors   he was so tall that  if he had been so disposed  he could have snapped off the heads of the birds roosting on the topmost branches of the highest trees  as he stood up  without being at the trouble to climb   and if he had at any time taken a fancy to one of the same trees for a walking stick  he would have had no more to do than to pluck it up with his thumb and finger and strip down the leaves and twigs with the palm of his hand   bidding good by to his old grandmother  who pulled a very long face over his departure  manabozho set out at a great pace  for he was able to stride from one side of a prairie to the other at a single step   he found his father on a high mountain far in the west   his father espied his approach at a great distance  and bounded down the mountainside several miles to give him welcome   apparently delighted with each other  they reached in two or three of their giant paces the lodge of the west which stood high up near the clouds   they spent some days in talking with each other for these two great persons did nothing on a small scale  and a whole day to deliver a single sentence  such was the immensity of their discourse  was quite an ordinary affair   one evening manabozho asked his father what he was most afraid of on earth   he replied  nothing     but is there nothing you dread here nothing that would hurt you if you took too much of it   come  tell me    manabozho was very urgent  so at last his father said   yes  there is a black stone to be found a couple of hundred miles from here  over that way   pointing as he spoke    it is the only thing on earth i am afraid of  for if it should happen to hit me on any part of my body it would hurt me very much    the west made this important circumstance known to manabozho in the strictest confidence    now you will not tell anyone  manabozho  that the black stone is bad medicine for your father  will you    he added    you are a good son  and i know you will keep it to yourself   now tell me  my darling boy  is there not something that you don t like    manabozho answered promptly  nothing    his father  who was of a steady and persevering nature  put the same question to him seventeen times  and each time manabozho made the same answer    nothing    but the west insisted  there must be something you are afraid of     well  i will tell you   said manabozho   what it is    he made an effort to speak  but it seemed to be too much for him    out with it   said the west  fetching manabozho such a blow on the back as shook the mountain with its echo    je ee  je ee it is   said manabozho  apparently in great pain    yes  yes   i cannot name it  i tremble so    the west told him to banish his fears  and to speak up  no one would hurt him   manabozho began again  and he would have gone over the same make believe of pain  had not his father  whose strength he knew was more than a match for his own  threatened to pitch him into a river about five miles off   at last he cried out    father  since you will know  it is the root of the bulrush    he who could with perfect ease spin a sentence a whole day long  seemed to be exhausted by the effort of pronouncing that one word   bulrush    some time after manabozho observed   i will get some of the black rock  merely to see how it looks     well   said the father   i will also get a little of the bulrush root  to learn how it tastes    they were both double dealing with each other  and in their hearts getting ready for some desperate work   they had no sooner separated for the evening than manabozho was striding off the couple of hundred miles necessary to bring him to the place where the black rock was to be procured  while down the other side of the mountain hurried ningabinn  the west   at the break of day they each appeared at the great level on the mountain top  manabozho with twenty loads  at least  of the black stone  on one side  and on the other the west  with a whole meadow of bulrush in his arms   manabozho was the first to strike hurling a great piece of the black rock  which struck the west directly between the eyes  and he returned the favor with a blow of bulrush that rung over the shoulders of manabozho  far and wide  like the long lash of the lightning among the clouds   first one and then the other  manabozho poured in a tempest of black rock  while the west discharged a shower of bulrush   blow upon blow  thwack upon thwack they fought hand to hand until black rock and bulrush were all gone   then they betook themselves to hurling crags at each other  cudgeling with huge oak trees  and defying each other from one mountain top to another  while at times they shot enormous boulders of granite across at each other s heads  as though they had been mere jackstones   the battle  which had commenced on the mountains  had extended far west   the west was forced to give ground   manabozho pressing on  drove him across rivers and mountains  ridges and lakes  till at last he got him to the very brink of the world    hold   cried the west    my son  you know my power  and although i allow i am now fairly out of breath  it is impossible to kill me   stop where you are  and i will also portion you out with as much power as your brothers   the four quarters of the globe are already occupied  but you can go and do a great deal of good to the people of the earth  which is beset with serpents  beasts and monsters  who make great havoc of human life   go and do good  and if you put forth half the strength you have to day  you will acquire a name that will last forever   when you have finished your work i will have a place provided for you   you will then go and sit with your brother  kabinocca  in the north    manabozho gave his father his hand upon this agreement   and parting from   him  he returned to his own grounds  where he lay for some time sore of his wounds   why the woodpecker has red head feathers  adapted from h  r  schoolcraft  when his wounds had all been cured by his grandmother s skill in medicine  manabozho  as big and sturdy as ever  was ripe for new adventures   he set his thoughts immediately upon a war excursion against the pearl feather  a wicked old manito  living on the other side of the great lake  who had killed his grandfather   he began his preparations by making huge bows and arrows without number  but he had no arrow heads   at last his grandmother  noko  told him that an old man who lived at some distance could furnish him with some  and he sent her to get them   though she returned with her wrapper full  he told her that he had not enough and sent her again for more   in the meanwhile he thought to himself   i must find out the way of making these heads    instead of directly asking how it was done  he preferred just like manabozho to deceive his grandmother  in order to learn what he wanted by a trick    noko   said he   while i take my drum and rattle  and sing my war songs  do you go and try to get me some larger heads  for these you have brought me are all of the same size   go and see whether the old man is not willing to make some a little larger    he followed her at a distance as she went  having left his drum at the lodge  with a great bird tied at the top  whose fluttering wings should keep up the drumbeat  the same as if he were standing there beating the drum himself   he saw the old workman busy  and learned how he prepared the heads  he also beheld the old man s daughter  who was very beautiful   manabozho discovered for the first time that he had a heart of his own  and the sigh he heaved passed through the arrow maker s lodge like a young gale of wind    my how it blows   said the old man    it must be from the south  though   said the daughter   it is so fragrant    manabozho slipped away  and in two strides he was at home  shouting forth his songs as though he had never left the lodge   he had just time to untie the bird which had been beating the drum when his grandmother came in and gave him the big arrowheads   in the evening the grandmother said   my son  you ought to fast before you go to war  as your brothers do  to find out whether you will be successful or not    he said he had no objection   having privately stored away in a shady place in the forest two or three dozen juicy bears  a moose  and twenty strings of the tenderest birds  he would retire from the lodge so far as to be entirely out of view of his grandmother and fall to and enjoy himself heartily   at nightfall  having dispatched a dozen birds and half a bear or so  he would return  tottering and forlorn  as if quite famished  so as to make his grandmother feel sorry for him   when he had finished his term of fasting  in the course of which he slyly dispatched twenty fat bears  six dozen birds  and two fine moose  manabozho sung his war song and embarked in his canoe  fully prepared for war   besides his weapons he took along a large supply of oil   he traveled rapidly night and day  for he had only to will or speak  and the canoe went   at length he arrived in sight of the fiery serpents  and stopped to study them   he noticed that they were of enormous length and of a bright color  that they were some distance apart  and that the flames which poured forth from the mouths reached across the pass  so he said good morning and began talking with them in a very friendly way   they were not to be deceived  however    we know you  manabozho   they said   you cannot pass    turning his canoe as if about to go back  he suddenly cried out with a loud and terrified voice    what is that behind you    the serpents thrown off their guard  instantly turned their heads  and in a moment manabozho glided silently past them    well   said he  softly  after he had got by   how about it    he then took up his bow and arrows  and with deliberate aim shot every one of them easily  for the serpents were fixed to one spot and could not even turn around   having thus escaped the sentinel serpents  manabozho pushed on in his canoe until he came to a part of the lake called pitch water  as whatever touched it was sure to stick fast   but manabozho was prepared with his oil and  rubbing his canoe freely with it  from end to end  he slipped through with ease and he was the first person who had ever succeeded in passing through the pitch water    nothing like a little oil   said manabozho to himself   having by this time come in view of land  he could see the lodge of the shining manito  high upon a distant hill   at the dawn of day he put his clubs and arrows in order and began his attack  yelling and shouting and beating his drum  and calling out so as to make it appear that he had many followers    surround him  surround him  run up  run up    he stalked bravely forward  shouting aloud   it was you that killed my grandfather   and shot off a whole forest of arrows   the pearl feather appeared on the height  blazing like the sun  and paid back manabozho with a tempest of bolts which rattled like hail   all day long the fight was kept up  and manabozho had fired all of his arrows but three without effect  for the shining manito was clothed in pure wampum   it was only by immense leaps to right and left that manabozho could save his head from the sturdy blows which fell about him on every side  like pine trees  from the hands of the manito   he was badly bruised  and at his very wits  end  when a large woodpecker flew past and lit on a tree   it was a bird he had known on the prairie  near his grandmother s lodge    manabozho   called out the woodpecker   your enemy has a weak point  shoot at the lock of hair on the crown of his head    the first arrow he shot only drew a few drops of blood   the manito made one or two unsteady steps  but recovered himself   he began to parley  but manabozho  now that he had discovered a way to reach him  was in no humor to trifle  and he let slip another arrow which brought the shining manito to his knees   having the crown of his head within good range manabozho shot his third arrow  and the manito fell forward upon the ground  dead   manabozho called the woodpecker to come and receive a reward for the timely hint he had given him  and he rubbed the blood of the shining manito on the woodpecker s head  the feathers of which are red to this day   full of his victory  manabozho returned home  beating his war drum furiously and shouting aloud his song of triumph   his grandmother was on the shore to welcome him with the war dance  which she performed with wonderful skill for one so far advanced in years   why the diver duck has so few tail feathers  adapted from h  r  schoolcraft  having overcome the powerful pearl feather  killed his serpents and escaped all is wiles and charms  the heart of manabozho welled within him   an unconquerable desire for further adventures seized upon him  he had won in a great fight on land  so he determined  his next success should come to him from the water   he tried his luck as a fisherman and with such success that he captured an enormous fish  a fish so  rich in fat that with the oil manabozho was able to  form a small lake   wishing to be generous  and at the same time having a cunning plan of his own  he invited all the birds and beasts of his acquaintance to come and feast upon the oil  telling them that the order in which they partook of the banquet  would decide how fat each was to be for all time to  come   as fast as they arrived he told them to plunge in and help themselves   the first to make his appearance was the bear   who took a long and steady draft  then came the deer  the opossum  and such others of the family as are noted for their comfortable covering   the moose and the buffalo were late in arriving on the scene  and the partridge  always lean in flesh  looked on till the supply was nearly gone   there was not  a drop left by the time the hare and the marten appeared on the shore of the lake  and they are  in consequence  the slenderest of all creatures   when this ceremony was over manabozho suggested to his friends  the assembled birds and animals  that the occasion was proper for a little merrymaking  and taking up his drum he cried out    new songs from the south  come  brothers  dance    they all fell in and commenced their rounds   whenever manabozho  as he stood in the circle  saw a fat fowl which he fancied pass him  he adroitly wrung its neck and slipped it under his belt  at the same time beating his drum and singing at the top of his lungs to drown the noise of the fluttering  crying out in a tone of admiration    that s the way  my brothers  that s the way    at last a small duck of the diver family  thinking there was something wrong  opened one eye and saw what manabozho was doing   giving a spring  and crying   ha ha  a  manabozho is killing us   he made a dash for the water   manabozho was so angry that the creature should have played the spy that he gave chase  and just as the diver duck was getting into the water he gave him a kick  which is the reason that the diver s tail feathers are few  his back flattened  and his legs straightened out  so that when he is seen walking on land he makes a sorry looking figure   the other birds  having no ambition to be thrust in manabozho s belt  flew off  and the animals scampered into the woods   manaibozho is changed into awolf  adapted from h  r  schoolcraft  one evening  as manabozho was walking along the shore of a great lake  weary and hungry  he met a great magician in the form of an old wolf  with six young ones  coming toward him   the wolf no sooner caught sight of him than he told his whelps  who were close beside him  to keep out of the way of manabozho   for i know   he said   that it is that mischievous fellow whom we see yonder    the young wolves were in the act of running off when manabozho cried out   my grandchildren  where are you going   stop and i will go with you   i wish to have a little chat with your excellent father    saying which  he advanced and greeted the old wolf  expressing himself as delighted at seeing him looking so well    whither do you journey   he asked    we are looking for a good hunting ground to pass the winter   the old wolf answered    what brings you here     i was looking for you   said manabozho    for i have a passion for the chase  brother   i always admired your family  are you willing to change me into a wolf    the wolf gave him a favorable answer  and he was forthwith changed into a wolf    well  that will do   said manabozho    but   he said  looking at his tail   could you oblige me by making my tail a little longer and more bushy  just a little more bushy     certainly   said the old wolf  and he straightway gave manabozho such a length and spread of tail that it was continually getting between his legs  and it was so heavy that it was as much as he could do to carry it   but  having asked for it  he was ashamed to say a word  and they all started off in company  dashing up the ravine   after getting into the woods for some distance they ran across the tracks of moose   the young ones scampered off in pursuit  the old wolf and manabozho following at their leisure    well   said the old wolf  by way of starting the conversation   who do you think is the fastest of the boys   can you tell by the jumps they take     why   he replied   that one that takes such  long jumps  he is surely the fastest     ha  ha  you are mistaken   said the old wolf    he makes a good start  but he will be the first to tire out  this one who appears to be behind will be the one to kill the game    by this time they had come to the spot where the boys had started in chase   one had dropped what seemed to be a small medicine sack  which he carried for the use of the hunting party    take that  manabozho   said the old wolf    why  what will i do with a dirty dog skin    the old wolf took it up  it was a beautiful robe    oh  i will carry it now   cried manabozho    oh  no   said the wolf  who had used his magical powers   it is a robe of pearls   come along   and away he sped at a great rate of speed    not so fast   called manabozho after him  and then he added to himself as he panted after   oh  this tail    coming to a place where the moose had lain down  they saw that the young wolves had made a fresh start after their prey     why   said the old wolf   this moose is thin   i know by the tracks   i can always tell whether they are fat or not    a little farther on  one of the young wolves  in dashing at the moose  had broken a tooth on a tree    manabozho   said the old wolf   one of your grandchildren has shot at the game   take his arrow  there it is     no   replied manabozho   what will i do with a dirty dog s tooth    the old wolf took it up  and behold it was a beautiful silver arrow   when they at last overtook them  they found that the youngsters had killed a very fat moose   manabozho was very hungry  but the old wolf just then again exerted his magical powers  and manabozho saw nothing but the bones picked quite clean   he thought to himself   just as i expected  dirty  greedy fellows   if it had not been for this log at my back i should have been in time to have got a mouthful   and he cursed the bushy tail which he carried to the bottom of his heart   the old wolf finally called out to one of the young ones   give some meat to your grandfather    one of them obeyed  and coming near to manabozho he presented him the end of his own bushy tail  which was now nicely seasoned with burs gathered in the course of the hunt   manabozho jumped up and called out   you dog  do you think i am going to eat you   and he walked off in anger    come back brother   cried the wolf    you are losing your eyes   you do the child injustice   look there i  and behold a heap of fresh meat was lying on the spot  all prepared   manabozho turned back  and at the sight of so much good food put on a smiling face    wonderful   he said   how fine the meat is      yes   replied the old wolf   it is always so with us  we know our work and always get the best   it is not a long tail that makes the hunter    manabozho bit his lip   manabozho is robbed by the wolves  adapted from h  r  schoolcraft  shortly after this the old wolf suggested to manabozho that he should go out and try his luck in hunting by himself   when he chose to put his mind to it he was quite expert  and this time he succeeded in killing a fine fat moose which he thought he would take aside slyly and devour alone   he was very hungry and he sat down to eat  but as he never could go to work in a straightforward way  he immediately fell into great doubts as to the proper point at which to begin    well   said he   i do not know where to commence   at the head   no  people will laugh  and say   he ate him backward     he went to the side    no   said he   they will say i ate him sideways    he then went to the hind quarter    no  that will not do  either  they will say i ate him forward   i will begin here  say what they will    he took a delicate piece from the small of the back  and was just on the point of putting it to his mouth when a tree close by made a creaking noise   he seemed vexed at the sound   he raised the morsel to his mouth the second time  when the tree creaked again    why   he exclaimed   i cannot eat when i hear such a noise   stop  stop    he cried to the tree   he put down the morsel of meat  exclaiming    i cannot eat with such a noise   and starting away he climbed the tree and was actually pulling at the limb which had bothered him  when his forepaw was caught between the branches so that he could not free himself   while thus held fast he saw a pack of wolves advancing through the wood in the direction of his meat   he suspected them to be the old wolf and his cubs  but night was coming on and he could not make them out    go the other way  go the other way   he cried out   what do you expect to get here    the wolves stopped for a while and talked among themselves  and said   manabozho must have something there  or he would not tell us to go another way      i begin to know know him   said the old wolf   and all his tricks  let us go forward and see   they came on and  finding the moose soon made away with it   manabozho looked wistfully on while they ate until they were fully satisfied  when off they scampered in high spirits   a heavy blast of wind opened the branches finally  and released him   the wolves had left nothing but bare bones   he made for home   when he related his mishap  the old wolf  taking him by the forepaw  condoled with him deeply on his ill luck   a tear even started to his eye as he added   my brother  this should teach us not to meddle with points of ceremony when we have good meat to eat    manabozho and the woodpeckers  adapted from h  r  schoolcraft  manabozho lost the greater part of his magical power through letting his young wolf grandson fall through the thin ice and drown   no one knew where his grandmother had gone to   he married the arrow maker s daughter  and became the father of several children  but he was very poor and scarcely able to procure a living   his lodge was pitched in a distant part of the country  where he could get no game  and it was winter time   one day he said to his wife   i will go out walking and see if i can find some lodges    after walking some time he finally discovered a lodge at a distance  there were children playing at the door  and when they saw him approaching they ran in and told their parents manabozho was coming   it was the home of the large red headed woodpecker   he came to the door and asked manabozho to enter  and the invitation was promptly accepted   after some time the woodpecker  who was a magician  said to his wife   have you nothing to give manabozho   he must be hungry    she answered   no     he ought not to go without his supper   said the woodpecker    i will see what i can do    in the center of the lodge stood a large tamarack tree   upon this the woodpecker flew  and commenced going up  turning his head on each side of the tree  and every now and then driving in his bill   at last he pulled something out of the tree and threw it down  when  behold  a fine fat raccoon lay on the ground   he drew out six or seven more  and then came down and told his wife to prepare them    manabozho   he said   this is the only thing we eat  what else can we give you     it is very good   replied manabozho   they smoked their pipes and conversed  and after a while manabozho got ready to go home  so the woodpecker said to his wife   give him the other raccoons to take home for his children    in the act of leaving the lodge manabozho on purpose dropped one of his mittens  which was soon after observed upon the ground    run   said the woodpecker to his eldest son   and give it to him  but mind that you do not give it into his hand  throw it at him  for there is no knowing what he may do  he acts so curiously    the boy did as he was directed    grandfather   he said  as he came up to him   you have left one of your mittens  and here it is     yes   he said  making believe he did not know he had dropped it   so i did  but don t throw it  you will get it wet on the snow    the lad  however  threw it  and was about to return when manabozho cried out   bakah  bakah  stop  stop  is that all you eat   do you eat nothing else with your raccoon   tell me     yes  that is all  answered the young woodpecker   we have nothing else     tell your father   continued manabozho   to come and visit me  and let him bring a sack   i will give him what he shall eat with his raccoon meat    when the young one returned and reported this message to his father the old woodpecker turned up his nose at the invitation    i wonder   he said  what he thinks he has got  poor fellow   he was bound  however  to answer the offer of hospitality  and he went accordingly  taking along a cedar sack  to pay a visit to manabozho   manabozho received the old red headed woodpecker with great ceremony  he had stood at the door awaiting his arrival  and as soon as he came in sight manabozho commenced  while he was yet far off  bowing and opening wide his arms  in token of welcome  all of which the woodpecker returned in due form  by ducking his bill and hopping to right and left  extending his wings to their full length and fluttering them back to his breast   when the woodpecker at last reached the lodge manabozho made several remarks upon the weather  the appearance of the country  and especially spoke of the scarcity of game    but we   he added  we always have enough   come in  and you shall not go away hungry  my noble birds    manabozho had always prided himself on being able to give as good as he had received  and to be up with the woodpecker he had shifted his lodge so as to inclose a large dry tamarack tree    what can i give you   said he to the woodpecker   as we eat so shall you eat    with this he hopped forward and  jumping on the tamarack tree  he attempted to climb it just as he had seen the woodpecker do in his own lodge   he turned his head first on one side and then on the other  as the woodpecker does  striving to go up the tree  but as often slipping down   every now and then he would strike the tree with his nose  as if it was a bell  and draw back as if to pull something out of the tree  but he pulled out no raccoons   he dashed his nose so often against the trunk that at last the blood began to flow  and he tumbled down senseless on the ground   the woodpecker started up with his drum and rattle to restore him  and by beating them violently he succeeded in bringing him to   as soon as he came to his senses  manabozho began to lay the blame of his failure upon his wife  saying to his guest   nemesho  it is this woman relation of yours she is the cause of my not succeeding   she has made me a worthless fellow   before i married her i also could get raccoons   the woodpecker said nothing  but flying on the tree he drew out several fine raccoons    here   said he   this is the way we do  and left him in disdain  carrying his bill high in the air  and stepping over the doorsill as if it were not worthy to be touched by his toes   the boy and the wolves  retold by andrew lang  once upon a time an indian hunter built himself a house in the middle of a great forest  far away from all his tribe  for his heart was gentle and kind and he was weary of the treachery and cruel deeds of those who had been his friends   so he left them and took his wife and three children  and they journeyed on until they found a spot near to a clear stream  where they began to cut down trees and to make ready their wigwam   for many years they lived peacefully and happily in this sheltered place  never leaving it except to hunt the wild animals  which served them both for food and clothes   at last  however  the strong man fell sick  and before long lie knew he must die   so he gathered his family round him and said his last words to them    you  my wife  the companion of my days  will follow me ere many moons have waned to the island of the blessed   but for you  0 my children  whose lives are but newly begun  the wickedness  unkindness  and ingratitude from which i fled are before you   yet i shall go hence in peace  my children  if you will promise always to love each other and never to forsake your youngest brother     never   they replied  holding out their hands   and the hunter died content   scarcely eight moons had passed when  just as he had said  the wife went forth and followed her husband  but before leaving her children she bade the two elder ones think of their promise never to forsake the younger  for he was a child and weak   and while the snow lay thick upon the ground they tended him and cherished him  but when the earth showed green again the heart of the young man stirred within him  and he longed to see the wigwams of the village where his father s youth was spent   therefore he opened all his heart to his sister  who answered   my brother  i understand your longing for our fellow men  whom here we cannot see   but remember our father s words   shall we not seek our own pleasures and forget the little one    but he would not listen  and  making no reply  he took his bow and arrows and left the hut   the snows fell and melted  yet he never returned  and at last the heart of the girl grew cold and hard and her little boy became a burden in her eyes  till one day she spoke thus to him   see  there is food for many days to come   stay here within the shelter of the hut   i go to seek our brother  and when i have found him i shall return hither    but when  after hard journeying  she reached the village where her brother dwelt and saw that he had a wife and was happy  and when she  too  was sought by a young brave  then she also forgot the boy alone in the forest and thought only of her husband   now as soon as the little boy had eaten all the food which his sister had left him  he went out into the woods and gathered berries and dug up roots  and while the sun shone he was contented and had his fill  but when the snows began and the wind howled  then his stomach felt empty and his limbs cold  and he hid in trees all the night and only crept out to eat what the wolves had left behind   and by and by  having no other friends  he sought their company  and sat by while they devoured their prey  and they grew to know him and gave him food   and without them he would have died in the snow   but at last the snows melted and the ice upon the great lake  and as the wolves went down to the shore the boy went after them   and it happened one day that his big brother was fishing in his canoe near the shore  and he heard the voice of a child singing in the indian tone     my brother  my brother    i am becoming a wolf    i am becoming a wolf    and when he had so sung he howled as wolves howl   then the heart of the elder sank and he hastened toward him  crying   brother  little brother  come to me   but he  being half a wolf  only continued his song   and the louder the elder called him   brother  little brother  come to me   the swifter he fled after his brothers the wolves and the heavier grew his skin  till  with a long howl  he vanished into the depths of the forest   so  with shame and anguish in his soul  the elder brother went back to his village  and with his sister mourned the little boy and the broken promise till the end of his life    the indian who lost his wife  retold by andrew lang  once upon a time there was a man and his wife who lived in the forest far from the rest of the tribe   very often they spent the day in hunting together  but after awhile the wife found that she had so many things to do that she was obliged to stay at home  so he went alone  though he found that when his wife was not with him he never had any luck   one day  when he was away hunting  the woman fell ill  and in a few days she died   her husband grieved bitterly and buried her in the house where she had passed her life  but as the time went on he felt so lonely without her that he made a wooden doll about her height amid size for company and dressed it in her clothes   he seated it in front of the fire and tried to think he had his wife back again   the next day he went out to hunt  and when he came home the first thing he did was to go up to the doll and brush off some of the ashes from the fire which had fallen on its face   but he was very busy now  for he had to cook and mend  besides getting food  for there was no one to help him  and so a whole year passed away   at the end of that time he came back from hunting one night and found some wood by the door and a fire within   the next night there was not only wood and fire  but a piece of meat in the kettle  nearly ready for eating   he searched all about to see who could have done this  but could find no one   the next time he went to hunt he took care not to go far and came in quite early   and while he was still a long way off he saw a woman going into the house with wood on her shoulders   so he made haste and opened the door quickly  and instead of the wooden doll his wife sat in front of the fire   then she spoke to him and said    the great spirit felt sorry for you because you would not be comforted  so he let me come back to you  but you must not stretch out your hand to touch me till we have seen the rest of our people   if you do i shall die    so the man listened to her words  and the woman dwelt there and brought the wood and kindled the fire  till one day her husband said to her    it is now two years since you died   let us now go back to our tribe  then you will be well and i can touch you    and with that he prepared food for the journey  a string of deer s flesh for her to carry and one for himself  and so they started   now  the camp of the tribe was distant six days  journey  and when they were yet one day s journey off it began to snow  and they felt weary and longed for rest   therefore they made a fire  cooked some food  and spread out their skins to sleep   then the heart of the man was greatly stirred and he stretched out his arms to his wife  but she waved her hands and said    we have seen no one yet   it is too soon    but he would not listen to her and caught her to him  and behold  he was clasping the wooden doll   and when he saw it was the doll he pushed it from him in his misery and rushed away to the camp and told them all his story   and some doubted  and they went back with him to the place where he and his wife had stopped to rest  and there lay the doll  and besides  they saw in time snow the steps of two people  and the foot of one was like the foot of the doll   and the man grieved sore all the days of his life   punchkin  by e  frere  once upon a time there was a raja who had seven beautiful daughters  they were all good girls  but the youngest  named balna  was more clever than the rest   the raja s wife died when they were quite little children  so these seven poor princesses were left with no mother to take care of them   the raja s daughters took it by turns to cook their father s dinner every day  while he was absent deliberating with his ministers on the affairs of the nation   about this time the prudhan died  leaving a widow and one daughter  and every day  when the seven princesses were preparing their father s dinner  the prudhan s widow and daughter would come and beg for a little fire from the hearth   then balna used to say to her sisters   send that woman away  send her away   let her get the fire at her own house   what does she want with ours   if we allow her to come here  we shall suffer for it some day    but the other sisters would answer   be quiet  balna  why must you always be quarreling with this poor woman   let her take some fire if she likes    then the prudhan s widow used to go to the hearth and take a few sticks from it  and while no one was looking  she would quickly throw some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being prepared for the raja s dinner   now the raja was very fond of his daughters   ever since their mother s death they had cooked his dinner with their own hands  in order to avoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies   so  when he found the mud mixed up with his dinner  he thought it must arise from their carelessness  as it did not seem likely that anyone should have put mud there on purpose  but being very kind he did not like to reprove them for it  although this spoiling of the curry was repeated many days   at last  one day  he determined to hide  and watch his daughters cooking  and see how it all happened  so he went into the next room  and watched them through a hole in the wall   there he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice and preparing the curry  and as each dish was completed  they put it by the fire ready to be cooked   next he noticed the prudhan s widow come to the door  and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinner with   balna turned to her  angrily  and said   why don t you keep fuel in your own house  and not come here every day and take ours   sisters  don t give this woman any more wood  let her buy it for herself    then the eldest sister answered   balna  let the poor woman take the wood and the fire  she does us no harm    but balna replied   if you let her come here so often  maybe she will do us some harm  and make us sorry for it  some day    the raja then saw the prudhan s widow go to the place where all his dinner was nicely prepared  and  as she took the wood  she threw a little mud into each of the dishes   at this he was very angry  and sent to have the woman seized and brought before him   but when the widow came  she told him that she had played this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him  and she spoke so cleverly  and pleased him so well with her cunning words  that instead of punishing her  the raja married her  and made her his ranee  and she and her daughter came to live in the palace   now the new ranee hated the seven poor princesses  and wanted to get them  if possible  out of the way  in order that her daughter might have all their riches  and live in the palace as princess in their place  and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to her  she did all she could to make them miserable   she gave them nothing but bread to eat  and very little of that  and very little water to drink  so these seven poor little princesses  who had been accustomed to have everything comfortable about them  and good food and good clothes all their lives long  were very miserable and unhappy  and they used to go out every day and sit by their dead mother s tomb and cry  and say    o mother  mother  cannot you see your poor children  how unhappy we are  and how we are starved by our cruel stepmother    one day  while they were thus sobbing and crying  lo and behold  a beautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave  covered with fresh  ripe pomeloes  and the children satisfied their hunger by eating some of the fruit  and every day after this  instead of trying to eat the bad dinner their stepmother provided for them  they used to go out to their mother s grave and eat the pommels which grew there on the beautiful tree   then the ranee said to her daughter   i cannot tell how it is  every day those seven girls say they don t want any dinner  and won t eat any  and yet they never grow thin nor look ill  they look better than you do   i cannot tell how it is     and she bade her watch the seven princesses  and see if anyone gave them anything to eat   so next day  when the princesses went to their mother s grave  and were eating the beautiful pomeloes  the prudhan s daughter followed them  and saw them gathering the fruit   then balna said to her sisters   do you not see that girl watching us  let us drive her away  or hide the pomeloes  else she will go and tell her mother all about it  and that will be bad for us    but the other sisters said   oh no  do not be unkind  balna   the girl would never be so cruel as to tell her mother   let us rather invite her to come and have some of the fruit    and calling her to them  they gave her one of the pomeloes   no sooner had she eaten it  however  than the prudhan s daughter went home and said to her mother   i do not wonder the seven princesses will not eat the dinner you prepare for them  for by their mother s grave there grows a beautiful pomelo tree  and they go there every day and eat the pomeloes   i ate one  and it was the nicest i have ever tasted    the cruel ranee was much vexed at hearing this  and all next day she stayed in her room  and told the raja that she had a very bad headache  the raja was deeply grieved  and said to his wife   what can i do for you     she answered   there is only one thing that will make my headache well   by your dead wife s tomb there grows a fine pomelo tree  you must bring that here  and boil it  root and branch  and put a little of the water in which it has been boiled on my forehead  and that will cure my headache     so the raja sent his servants  and had the beautiful pomelo tree pulled up by the roots  and did as the ranee desired  and when some of the water  in which it had been boiled  was put on her forehead  she said her headache was gone and she felt quite well   next day  when the seven princesses went as usual to the grave of their mother  the pomelo tree had disappeared   then they all began to cry very bitterly   now there was by the ranee s tomb a small tank  and as they were crying they saw the tank was filled with a rich cream like substance  which quickly hardened into a thick white cake   at seeing this all the princesses were very glad  and they ate some of the cake  and liked it  and next day the same thing happened  and so it went on for many days  every morning the princesses went to their mother s grave  and found the little tank filled with the nourishing cream like cake   then the cruel stepmother said to her daughter   i cannot tell how it is  i have had the pomelo tree which used to grow by the ranee s grave destroyed  and yet the princesses grow no thinner  nor look more sad  though they never eat the dinner i give them   i cannot tell how it is    and her daughter said   i will watch    next day  while the princesses were eating the cream cake  who should come by but their stepmother s daughter   balna saw her first  and said   see  sisters  there comes that girl again   let us sit round the edge of the tank and not allow her to see it  for if we give her some of our cake  she will go and tell her mother  and that will be very unfortunate for us    the other sisters  however  thought balna unnecessarily suspicious  and instead of following her advice  they gave the prudhan s daughter some of the cake  and she went home and told her mother all about it   the ranee  on hearing how well the princesses fared  was exceedingly angry  and sent her servants to pull down the dead ranee s tomb  and fill the little tank with the ruins   and not content with this  she next day pretended to be very  very ill in fact  at the point of death  and when the raja was much grieved  and asked her whether it was in his power to procure her any remedy  she said to him   only one thing can save my life  but i know you will not do it    he replied   yes  whatever it is  i will do it    she then said   to save my life  you must kill the seven daughters of your first wife  and put some of their blood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands  and their death will be my life    at these words the raja was very sorrowful  but because he feared to break his word  he went out with a heavy heart to find his daughters   he found them crying by the ruins of their mother s grave   then  feeling he could not kill them  the raja spoke kindly to them  and told them to come out into the jungle with him  and there he made a fire and cooked some rice  and gave it to them   but in the afternoon  it being very hot  the seven princesses all fell asleep  and when he saw they were fast asleep  the raja  their father  stole away and left them  for he feared his wife   saying to himself   it is better my poor daughters should die here  than be killed by their stepmother    he then shot a deer  and returning home  put some of its blood on the forehead and hands of the ranee  and she thought then that he had really killed the princesses  and said she felt quite well   meantime the seven princesses awoke  and when they found themselves all alone in the thick jungle they were much frightened  and began to call out as loud as they could  in hopes of making their father hear  but he was by that time far away  and would not have been able to hear them even had their voices been as loud as thunder   it so happened that this very day the seven young sons of a neighboring raja chanced to be hunting in that same jungle  and as they were returning home  after the day s sport was over  the youngest prince said to his brothers   stop  i think i hear some one crying and calling out   do you not hear voices   let us go in the direction of the sound  and find out what it is    so the seven princes rode through the wood until they came to the place where the seven princesses sat crying and wringing their hands   at the sight of them the young princes were very much astonished  and still more so on learning their story  and they settled that each should take one of these poor forlorn ladies home with him  and marry her   so the first and eldest prince took the eldest princess home with him  and married her   and the second took the second  and third took the third  and the fourth took the fourth  and the fifth took the fifth  and the sixth took the sixth  and the seventh  and the handsomest of all  took the beautiful balna   and when they got to their own land  there was great rejoicing throughout the kingdom  at the marriage of the seven young princes to seven such beautiful princesses   about a year after this balna had a little son  and his uncles and aunts were so fond of the boy that it was as if he had seven fathers and seven mothers   none of the other princes and princesses had any children  so the son of the seventh prince and balna was acknowledged their heir by all the rest   they had thus lived very happily for some time  when one fine day the seventh prince  balna s husband  said he would go out hunting  and away he went  and they waited long for him  but he never came back   then his six brothers said they would go and see what had become of him  and they went away  but they also did not return   and the seven princesses grieved very much  for they feared that their kind husbands must have been killed   one day  not long after this had happened  as balna was rocking her baby s cradle  and while her sisters were working in the room below  there came to the palace door a man in a long black dress  who said that he was a fakir  and came to beg   the servant said to him   you cannot go into the palace the raja s sons have all gone away  we think they must be dead  and their widows cannot be interrupted by your begging    but he said   i am a holy man  you must let me in   then the stupid servants let him walk through the palace  but they did not know that this was no fakir  but a wicked magician named punchkin   punchkin fakir wandered through the palace  and saw many beautiful things there  till at last he reached the room where balna sat singing beside her little boy s cradle   the magician thought her more beautiful than all the other beautiful things he had seen  insomuch that he asked her to go home with him and to marry him   but she said   my husband  i fear  is dead  but my little boy is still quite young  i will stay here and teach him to grow up a clever man  and when he is grown up he shall go out into the world  and try and learn tidings of his father   heaven forbid that i should ever leave him  or marry yon   at these words the magician was very angry  and turned her into a little black dog  and led her away  saying   since yon will not come with me of your own free will  i will make you    so the poor princess was dragged away  without any power of effecting an escape  or of letting her sisters know what had become of her   as punchkin passed through the palace gate the servants said to him   where did yon get that pretty little dog    and he answered   one of the princesses gave it to me as a present    at hearing which they let him go without further questioning   soon after this  the six elder princesses heard the little baby  their nephew  begin to cry  and when they went upstairs they were much surprised to find him all alone  and balna nowhere to be seen   then they questioned the servants  and when they heard of the fakir and the little black dog  they guessed what had happened  and sent in every direction seeking them  but neither the fakir nor the dog were to be found   what could six poor women do   they gave up all hopes of ever seeing their kind husbands  and their sister  and her husband again  and devoted themselves thenceforward to teaching and taking care of their little nephew   thus time went on  till balna s son was fourteen years old   then  one day  his aunts told him the history of the family  and no sooner did he hear it  than be was seized with a great desire to go in search of his father and mother and uncles  and if he could find them alive to bring them home again   his aunts  on learning his determination  were much alarmed and tried to dissuade him  saying   we have lost our husbands  and our sister and her husband  and you are now our sole hope  if you go away  what shall we do    but he replied   i pray you not to be discouraged  i will return soon  and if it is possible bring my father and mother and uncles with me    so he set out on his travels  but for some months he could learn nothing to help him in his search   at last  after he had journeyed many hundreds of weary miles  and become almost hopeless of ever hearing anything further of his parents  he one day came to a country that seemed full of stones  and rocks  and trees  and there he saw a large palace with a tower  hard by was a malee s little house   as he was looking about  the malee s wife saw him  and ran out of the house and said   my dear boy  who are you that dare venture to this dangerous place    he answered   i am a raja s son  and i come in search of my father  and my uncles  and my mother whom a wicked enchanter bewitched    then the malee s wife said   this country and this palace belong to a great enchanter  he is all powerful  and if anyone displeases him  he can turn them into stones and trees   all the rocks and trees you see here were living people once  and the magician turned them to what they now are   some time ago a raja s son came here  and shortly afterward came his six brothers  and they were all turned into stones and trees  and these are not the only unfortunate ones  for up in that tower lives a beautiful princess  whom the magician has kept prisoner there for twelve years  because she hates him and will not marry him    then the little prince thought   these must be my parents and my uncles   i have found what i seek at last    so he told his story to the malee s wife  and begged her to help him to remain in that place awhile and inquire further concerning the unhappy people she mentioned  and she promised to befriend him  and advised his disguising himself lest the magician should see him  and turn him likewise into stone   to this the prince agreed   so the malee s wife dressed him up in a saree  and pretended that he was her daughter   one day  not long after this  as the magician was walking in his garden he saw the little girl  as he thought  playing about  and asked her who she was   she told him she was the malee s daughter  and the magician said   you are a pretty little girl  and to morrow you shall take a present of flowers from me to the beautiful lady who lives in the tower    the young prince was much delighted at hearing this  and went immediately to inform the malee s wife  after consultation with whom he determined that it would be more safe for him to retain his disguise  and trust to the chance of a favorable opportunity for establishing some communication with his mother  if it were indeed she   now it happened that at balna s marriage her husband had given her a small gold ring on which her name was engraved  and she had put it on her little son s finger when he was a baby  and afterward when he was older his aunts had had it enlarged for him  so that he was still able to wear it   the malee s wife advised him to fasten the well known treasure to one of the bouquets he presented to his mother  and trust to her recognizing it   this was not to be done without difficulty  as such a strict watch was kept over the poor princess  for fear of her ever establishing communication with her friends   that though the supposed malee s daughter was permitted to take her flowers every day  the magician or one of his slaves was always in the room at the time  at last one day  however  opportunity favored him  and when no one was looking the boy tied the ring to a nosegay  and threw it at balna s feet   it fell with a clang on the floor  and balna  looking to see what made the strange sound  found the little ring tied to the flowers  on recognizing it  she at once believed the story her son told her of his long search  and begged him to advise her as to what she had better do  at the same time entreating him on no account to endanger his life by trying to rescue her   she told him that for twelve long years the magician had kept her shut up in the tower because she refused to marry him  and she was so closely guarded that she saw no hope of release   now balna s son was a bright  clever boy  so he said   do not fear  dear mother  the first thing to do is to discover how far the magician s power extends  in order that we may be able to liberate my father and uncles  whom he has imprisoned in the form of the rocks and trees   you have spoken to him angrily for twelve long years  now rather speak kindly   tell him you have given up all hopes of again seeing the husband you have so long mourned  and say you are willing to harry him   then endeavor to find out what his power consists in  and whether he is immortal  or can be put to death    balna determined to take her son s advice  and the next day sent for punchkin  and spoke to him as had been suggested   the magician greatly delighted  begged her to allow the wedding to take place as soon as possible   but she told him that before she married him he must allow her a little more time  in which she might make his acquaintance  and that  after being enemies so long  their friendship could but strengthen by degrees    and do tell me   she said   are you quite immortal   can death never touch you   and are you too great an enchanter ever to feel human suffering     why do you ask   said he    because   she replied    if i am to be your wife  i would fain know all about you  in order  if any calamity threatens you  to overcome  or if possible to avert it     it is true   he added   that i am not as others   far  far away  hundreds of thousands of miles from this  there lies a desolate country covered with thick jungle   in the midst of the jungle grows a circle of palm trees  and in the center of the circle stand six chattees full of water  piled one above another  below the sixth chattee is a small cage which contains a little green parrot  on the life of the parrot depends my life  and if the parrot is killed i must die   it is  however   he added   impossible that the parrot should sustain any injury  both on account of the inaccessibility of the country  and because  by my appointment  many thousand genii surround the palm trees  and kill all who approach the place    balna told her son what punchkin had said  but at the same time implored him to give up all idea of getting the parrot   the prince  however  replied   mother  unless i can get hold of that parrot  you  and my father  and uncles  cannot be liberated  be not afraid  i will shortly return   do you  meantime  keep the magician in good humor still putting off your marriage with him on various pretexts  and before he finds out the cause of delay  i will be here   so saying  he went away   many  many weary miles did he travel  till at last he came to a thick jungle  and  being very tired  sat down under a tree and fell asleep  he was awakened by a soft rustling sound  and looking about him  saw a large serpent which was making its way to an eagle s nest built in the tree under which he lay  and in the nest were two young eagles   the prince seeing the danger of the young birds  drew his sword  and killed the serpent  at the same moment a rushing sound was heard in the air  and the two old eagles  who had been out hunting for food for their young ones  returned   they quickly saw the dead serpent and the young prince standing over it  and the old mother eagle said to him   dear boy  for many  years all our young ones have been devoured by that cruel serpent  you have now saved the lives of our children  whenever you are in need therefore  send to us and we will help you  and as for these little eagles  take them  and let them be your servants    at this the prince was very glad  and the two eaglets crossed their wings  on which he mounted  and they carried him far  far away over the thick  jungles  until he came to the place where grew the circle of palm trees  in the midst of which stood the six chattees full of water  it was the middle of the day  and the heat was very great   all round the trees were the genii fast asleep  nevertheless  there were such countless thousands of them  that it would have been quite impossible for anyone to walk through their ranks to the place  down swooped the strong winged eaglets down jumped the prince  in an instant he had overthrown the six chattees full of water  and seized the little green parrot  which he rolled up in his cloak  while  as he mounted again into the air  all the genii below awoke  and finding their treasure gone  set up a wild and melancholy howl   away  away flew the little eagles  till they came to their home in the great tree  then the prince said to the old eagles   take back your little ones  they have done me good service  if ever again i stand in need of help  i will not fail to come to you    he then continued his journey on foot till he arrived once more at the magician s palace  where he sat down at the door and began playing with the parrot  punchkin saw him  and came to him quickly  and said   my boy  where did yon get that parrot   give it to me  i pray you    but the prince answered   oh no  i cannot give away my parrot  it is a great pet of mine  i have had it many years    then the magician said   if it is an old favorite  i can understand your not caring to give it away  but come  what will you sell it for     sir   said the prince   i will not sell my parrot    then punchkin got frightened  and said   anything  anything  name what price you will  and it shall be yours    the prince answered   let the seven raja s sons whom you turned into rocks and trees be instantly liberated     it is done as you desire   said the magician   only give me my parrot    and with that  by a stroke of his wand  balna s husband and his brothers resumed their natural shapes    now  give me my parrot   repeated punchkin    not so fast  my master   rejoined the prince   i must first beg that you will restore to life all whom you have thus imprisoned    the magician immediately waved his wand again  and whilst he cried  in an imploring voice   give me my parrot   the whole garden became suddenly alive  where rocks  and stones  and trees had been before  stood rajas  and punts  and sirdars  and mighty men on prancing horses  and jeweled pages  and troops of armed attendants    give me my parrot   cried punchkin   then the boy took hold of the parrot  and tore off one of its wings  and as he did so the magician s right arm fell off   punchkin then stretched out his left arm  crying   give me my parrot   the prince pulled off the parrot s second wing  and the magician s left arm tumbled off    give me my parrot   cried he  and fell on his knees   the prince pulled off the parrot s right leg  and the magician s right leg fell off  the prince pulled off the parrot s left leg  down fell the magician s left   nothing remained of him save the limbless body and the head  but still he rolled his eyes  and cried  give me my parrot     take your parrot  then  cried the boy  and with that   he wrung the bird s neck  and threw it at the magician  and as he did so  punchkin s head twisted round and  with a fearful groan  he died   then they let balna out of the tower  and she  her son  and the seven princes went to their own country  and lived very happily ever afterward   and as to the rest of the world  everyone went to his own house   how sun  moon and wind went out to dinner  by e  frere  one day sun  moon  and wind went out to dine with their uncle and aunt thunder and lightning   their mother  one of the most distant stars you see far up in the sky  waited alone for her children s return   now both sun and wind were greedy and selfish   they enjoyed the great feast that had been prepared for them  without a thought of saving any of it to take home to their mother but the gentle moon did not forget her   of every dainty dish that was brought round  she placed a small portion under one of her beautiful long fingernails  that star might also have a share in the treat   on their return  their mother  who had kept watch for them all night long with her little bright eye  said   well  children  what have yon brought home for me    then sun  who was eldest  said   i have brought nothing home for you   i went out to enjoy myself with my friends not to fetch dinner for my mother    and wind said   neither have i brought anything home for you  mother   you could hardly expect me to bring a collection of good things for you  when i merely went out for my own pleasure    but moon said   mother  fetch a plate  see what i have brought you    and shaking her hands she showered down such a choice dinner as never was seen before   then star turned to sun and spoke thus   because you went out to amuse yourself with your friends  and feasted and enjoyed yourself  without any thought of our mother at home you shall be cursed   henceforth  your rays shall ever be hot and scorching  and shall burn all that they touch   and men shall hate you  and cover their heads when you appear    and that is why the sun is so hot to this day    then she turned to wind and said   you also who forgot your mother in the midst of your selfish pleasures hear your doom   you shall always blow in the hot  dry weather  and shall parch and shrivel all living things   and men shall detest and avoid you from this very time     and that is why the wind in the hot weather is still so disagreeable    but to moon she said   daughter  because you remembered your mother  and kept for her a share in your own enjoyment  from henceforth you shall be ever cool  and calm and bright   no noxious glare shall accompany your pure rays  and men shall always call you  blessed     and that is why the moon s light is so soft  and cool  and beautiful even to this day    why the fish laughed  by joseph jacobs  as a certain fisherwoman passed by a palace crying her fish  the queen appeared at one of the windows and beckoned her to come near and show what she had   at that moment a very big fish jumped about in the bottom of the basket    is it a he or a she    inquired the queen    i wish to purchase a she fish    on hearing this the fish laughed aloud    it s a he   replied the fisherwoman  and proceeded on her rounds   the queen returned to her room in a great rage  and on coming to see her in the evening  the king noticed that something had disturbed her    are you indisposed    he said    no  but i am very much annoyed at the strange behavior of a fish   a woman brought me one to day  and on my inquiring whether it was a male or female  the fish laughed most rudely     a fish laugh  impossible  you must be dreaming     i am not a fool   i speak of what i have seen with my own eyes and heard with my own ears     passing strange  be it so   i will inquire concerning it    on the morrow the king repeated to his vizier what his wife had told him  and bade him investigate the matter  and be ready with a satisfactory answer within six mouths  on pain of death   the vizier promised to do his best  though he felt almost certain of failure   for live months he labored indefatigably to find a reason for the laughter of the fish   he sought everywhere and from everyone   the wise and learned  and they who were skilled in magic and in all manner of trickery  were consulted   nobody  however  could explain the matter  and so he returned broken hearted to his house  and began to arrange his affairs in prospect of certain death  for he had had sufficient experience of the king to know that his majesty would not go back from his threat   amongst other things  he advised his son to travel for a time  until the king s anger should have somewhat cooled   the young fellow  who was both clever and handsome  started off whithersoever kismet might lead him   he had been gone some days  when he fell in with an old farmer  who also was on a journey to a certain village   finding the old man very pleasant  he asked him if he might accompany him  professing to be on a visit to the same place   the old farmer agreed  and they walked along together   the day was hot  and the way was long and weary    don t yon think it would be pleasanter if you and i sometimes gave one another a lift    said the youth    what a fool the man is   thought the old farmer   presently they passed through a field of corn ready for the sickle  and looking  like a sea of gold as it waved to and fro in the breeze    is this eaten or not    said the young man   not understanding his meaning  the old man replied   i don t know    after a little while the two travelers arrived at a big village  where the young man gave his companion a clasp knife  and said   take this  friend  and get two horses with it  but mind and bring it back  for it is very precious    the old man  looking half amused and half angry  pushed back the knife  muttering something to the effect that his friend was either a fool himself or else tying to play the fool with him   the young man pretended not to notice his reply  and remained almost silent till they reached the city  a short distance outside which was the old farmer s house   they walked about the bazaar and went to the mosque  but nobody saluted them or invited them to come in and rest    what a large cemetery   exclaimed the young man    what does the man mean   thought the old farmer   calling this largely populated city a cemetery    on leaving the city their way led through a cemetery where a few people were praying beside a grave and distributing chupatties and kulchas to passers by  in the name of their beloved dead   they beckoned to the two travelers and gave them as much as they would    what a splendid city this is   said the young man    now  the man must surely be demented    thought the old farmer    i wonder what he will do next   he will be calling the land water  and the water land  and be speaking of light where there is darkness  and of darkness where it is light    however  he kept his thoughts to himself   presently they had to wade through a stream that ran along the edge of the cemetery   the water was rather deep  so the old farmer took off his shoes and pajamas and crossed over  but the young man waded through it with his shoes and pajamas on    well   i never did see such a perfect fool  both in word and in deed  said the old man to himself   however  he liked the fellow  and thinking that he would amuse his wife and daughter  he invited him to come and stay at his house as long as he had occasion to remain in the village    thank you very much   the young man replied   but let me first inquire  if you please  whether the beam of your house is strong     the old farmer left him in despair  and entered his house laughing    there is a man in yonder field   he said  after returning their greetings    he  has come the greater part of the way with me  and i wanted him to put up here as long as he had to stay in this village  but the fellow is such a fool that i cannot make anything out of him  he wants to know if the beam of this house is all right   the man must be mad   and saying this he burst into a fit of laughter    father   said the farmer s daughter  who was a very sharp and wise girl   this man  whosoever he is  is no fool  as you deem him   he only wishes to know if you can afford to entertain him     oh  of course   replied the farmer    i see   well perhaps you can help me to solve some of his other mysteries   while we were walking together he asked whether he should carry me or i should carry him  as he thought that would be a pleasanter mode of proceeding     most assuredly   said the girl    he meant that one of you should tell a story to beguile the time     oh  yes   well  we were passing through a cornfield  when he asked me whether it was eaten or not     and didn t you know the meaning of this  father   he simply wished to know if the man was in debt or not  because if the owner of the field was in debt  then the produce of the field was as good as eaten to him  that is  it would have to go to his creditors     yes  yes  yes  of course   then  on entering a certain village  he bade me take his clasp knife and get two horses with it  and bring back the knife again to him     are not two stout sticks as good as two horses for helping one along on the road   he only asked you to cut a couple of sticks and be careful not to lose his knife     i see   said time farmer    while we were walking over the city we did not see anybody that we knew  and not a soul gave us a scrap of anything to eat  till we were passing the cemetery  but there some people called to us and put into our hands some chupatties and kulchas  so my companion called the city a cemetery  and the cemetery a city     this also is to be understood  father  if one thinks of the city as the place where everything is to be obtained  and of inhospitable people as worse than the dead   the city  though crowded with people  was as if dead  as far as you were concerned  while  in the cemetery  which is crowded with time dead  you were saluted by kind friends and provided with bread     true  true   said the astonished farmer    then  just now  when we were crossing the stream  he waded through it without taking off his shoes and pajamas      i admire his wisdom   replied time girl    i have often thought how stupid people were to venture into that swiftly flowing stream and over those sharp stones with bare feet   the slightest stumble and they would fall  and be wetted from head to foot   this friend of yours is a most wise man   i should like to see him and speak to him     very well   said time farmer   i will go and find him  and bring him in     tell him  father  that our beams are strong enough  and then he will come in   i ll send on ahead a present to the man  to show him that we can afford to have him for our guest    accordingly she called a servant and sent him to the young man with a present of a basin of ghee  twelve chupatties  and a jar of milk  and the following message   o friend  time moon is full  twelve months make a year  and the sea is overflowing with water    half way the bearer of this present and message met his little son  who  seeing what was in the basket  begged his father to give him some of the food   his father foolishly complied   presently he saw the young man  and gave him the rest of the present and the message    give your mistress my salaam   he replied   and tell her that the moon is new  and that i can only find eleven mouths in the year  and the sea is by no means full    not understanding the meaning of these words  the servant repeated them word for word  as he had heard them  to his mistress  and thus his theft was discovered  and he was severely punished   after a little while the young man appeared with the old farmer   great attention was shown to him  and he was treated in every way as it he were the son of a great man  although his humble host knew nothing of his origin   at length be told them everything about the laughing of the fish  his father s threatened execution  and his own banishment and asked their advice as to what he should do    the laughing of the fish    said the girl  which seems to have been the cause of all this trouble  indicates that there is a man in the palace who is plotting against the king s life     joy  joy   exclaimed the vizier s son    there is yet time for me to return and save my father from an ignominious and unjust death  and the king from danger    the following day he hastened back to his own country  taking with him the farmer s daughter   immediately on arrival he ran to the palace and informed his father of what he had heard   the poor vizier  now almost dead from the expectation of death  was at once carried to the king  to whom he repeated the news that his son had just brought    never   said the king    but it must be so  your majesty   replied the vizier   and in order to prove the truth of what i have heard  i pray you call together all the maids in your palace  and order them to jump over a pit  which must be dug   we ll soon find out whether there is any man there    the king had time pit dug  and commanded all the maids belonging to the palace to try to jump it   all of them tried  but only one succeeded  that one was found to be a man   thus was the queen satisfied  and the faithful old vizier saved   afterward  as soon as could be  the vizier s son married the old farmer s daughter  and a most happy marriage it was   the farmer and the money lender  by joseph jacobs  there was ounce a farmer who suffered much at time hands of the money lender   good harvests  or bad  the farmer was always poor  the money lender rich   at the last  when he hadn t a farthing left  the farmer went to the money lender s house  and said   you can t squeeze water from a stone  and as you have nothing to get by me now  you might tell me the secret of becoming rich     my friend   returned the money lender  piously   riches come from ram  ask him     thank you  i will   replied the simple farmer  so he prepared three griddle cakes to last him on the journey  and set out to find ram   first he met a brahman  and to him he gave a cake asking him to point out the road to ram  but the brahman only took the cake and went on his way without a word   next the farmer met a jogi or devotee  and to him he gave a cake  without receiving any help in return   at last  he came upon a poor man sitting under a tree  and finding out he was hungry  the kindly farmer gave him his last cake  and sitting clown to rest beside him  entered into conversation    and where are you going    asked the poor man  at length    oh  i have a long journey before me  for i am going to find ram   replied the farmer    i don t suppose you could tell me which way to go     perhaps i can   said the poor man  smiling   for i am ram  what do you want of me    then the farmer told the whole story  and rain  taking pity on him  gave him a conch shell  and showed him how to blow it in a particular way  saying   remember  whatever you wish for  you have only to blow the conch that way  and your wish will be fulfilled   only have a care of that money lender  for even magic is not proof against their wiles    the farmer went back to his village rejoicing   in fact the money lender noticed his high spirits at once  and said to himself   some good fortune must have befallen the stupid fellow  to make him hold his head so jauntily    therefore he went over to the simple farmer s house  and congratulated him on his good fortune  in such cunning words  pretending to have heard all about it  that before long the farmer found himself telling the whole story all except the secret of blowing the conch  for  with all his simplicity  the farmer was not quite such a fool as to tell that   nevertheless  the money lender determined to have the conch by hook or by crook  and as he was villain enough not to stick at trifles  he waited for a favorable opportunity and stole the conch   but  after nearly bursting himself with blowing the conch in every conceivable way  he was obliged to give up the secret as a bad job  however  being determined to succeed he went back to the farmer and said  coolly   look here  i ve got your conch  but i can t use it  you haven t got it  so it s clear you can t use it either   business is at a standstill unless we make a bargain   now  i promise to give you back your conch  and never to interfere with your using it  on one condition  which is this whatever you get from it  i am to get double     never   cried the farmer   that would be the old business all over again     not at all   replied time wily money lender   you will have your share   now  don t be a dog in the manger  for if you get all you want  what can it matter to you if i am rich or poor    at last  though it went sorely against the grain to be of any benefit to a money lender  the farmer was forced to yield  and from that time  no matter what he gained by the power of the couch  time money lender gained double   and the knowledge that this was so preyed upon the farmer s mind day and night  so that he had no satisfaction out of anything   at last  there came a very dry season so dry that the farmer s crops withered for want of rain   then he blew his conch  and wished for a well to water them  and lo  there was the well  but the money lender had two  two beautiful new wells   this was too much for any farmer to stand  and our friend brooded over it  and brooded over it  till at last a bright idea came into his head   he seized the conch  blew it loudly  and cried out   oh ram   i wish to be blind of one eye    and so he was in a twinkling  but the money lender of course was blind of both  and in trying to steer his way between the two new wells  he fell into one and was drowned   now this true story shows that a farmer once got time better of a money lender but only by losing one of his eyes   pride goeth before a fall  by joseph jacobs  in a certain village there lived ten cloth merchants who always went about together   once upon a time they had traveled far afield  and were returning home with a great deal of money which they had obtained by selling their wares   now there happened to be a dense forest near their village  and this they reached early one morning   in it there lived three notorious robbers  of whose existence the traders had never heard  and while they were still in the middle of it the robbers stood before them  with swords and cudgels in their hands  and ordered them to lay down all they had   the traders had no weapons with them  and so  though they were many more in number  they had to submit themselves to the robbers  who took away everything from them  even the very clothes they wore  and gave to each only a small loin cloth a span in breadth and a cubit in length   the idea that they had conquered ten men and plundered all their property now took possession of the robbers  minds   they seated themselves like three monarchs before the men they had plundered  and ordered them to dance to them before returning home   the merchants now mourned their fate   they had lost all they had  except their loin cloth  and still the robbers were not satisfied  but ordered them to dance   there was  among the ten merchants  one who was very clever   he pondered over the calamity that had come upon him and his friends  the dance they would have to perform  and the magnificent manner in which the three robbers had seated themselves on the grass   at the same time he observed that these last had placed their weapons on the ground  in the assurance of having thoroughly cowed the traders  who were now commencing to dance   so he took the lead in the dance  and  as a song is always sung by the leader on such occasions  to which the rest keep time with hands and feet  he thus began to sing    we are enty men    they are erith men    if each erith man   surround eno men    eno man remains    ta  tai  tom  tadingana   the robbers were all uneducated  and thought that the leader was merely singing a song as usual   so it was in one sense  for the leader commenced from a distance  and had sung the song over twice before he and his companions commenced to approach the robbers   they had understood his meaning  because they had been trained in trade   when two traders discuss the price of an article in the presence of a purchaser  they use a riddling sort of language    what is the price of this cloth    one trader will ask another    enty rupees   another will reply  meaning  ten rupees    thus  there is no possibility of the purchaser knowing what is meant unless he be acquainted with trade language   by the rules of this secret language erith means  three   enty means  ten   and eno means  one    so the leader by his song meant to hint to his fellow traders that they were ten men  the robbers only three  that if three pounced upon each of the robbers  nine of them could hold them down  while the remaining one bound the robbers  hands and feet   the three thieves  glorying in their victory  and little understanding the meaning of the song and the intentions of the dancers  were proudly seated chewing betel and tobacco   meanwhile the song was sung a third time   ta  tai  tom had left the lips of the singer  and  before tadingana was out of them  the traders separated into parties of three  and each party pounced upon a thief   the remaining one the leader himself tore up into long narrow strips a large piece of cloth  six cubits long  and tied the hands and feet of the robbers   these were entirely humbled now  and rolled on the ground like three bags of rice   the ten traders now took back all their property  and armed themselves with the swords and cudgels of their enemies  and when they reached their village  they often amused their friends and relatives by relating their adventure   how the wicked sons were duped  by joseph jacobs  a very wealthy old man  imagining that he was on the point of death  sent for his sons and divided his property among them   however  he did not die for several years afterward  and miserable years many of them were   besides the weariness of old age  the old fellow had to bear with much abuse and cruelty from his sons   wretched  selfish ingrates  previously they vied with one another in trying to please their father  hoping thus to receive more money  but now they had received their patrimony  they cared not how soon he left them nay  the sooner the better  because he was only a needless trouble and expense   and they let the poor old man know what they felt   one day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles   the friend sympathized very much with him  and promised to think over the matter  and call in a little while and tell him what to do   he did so  in a few days he visited the old man and put down four bags full of stones and gravel before him    look here  friend   said he    your sons will get to know of my coming here to day  and will inquire about it   you must pretend that i came to discharge a long standing debt with you  and that you are several thousands of rupees richer than you thought you were   keep these bags in your own hands  and on no account let your sons get to them as long as you are alive   you will soon find them change their conduct toward you   salaam  i will come again soon to see how you are getting on    when the young men got to hear of this further increase of wealth they began to be more attentive and pleasing to their father than ever before   and thus they continued to the day of the old man s demise  when the bags were greedily opened  and found to contain only stones and gravel   the tiger  the brahman  and the jackal  by flora annie steel  once upon a time a tiger was caught in a trap   he tried in vain to get out through the bars  and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed   by chance a poor brahman came by    let me out of this cage  oh pious one   cried the tiger    nay  my friend   replied the brahman mildly  you would probably eat me if i did     not at all   swore the tiger with many oaths   on the contrary  i should be forever grateful  and serve you as a slave    now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore  the pious brahman s heart softened  and at last he consented to open the door of the cage   out popped the tiger  and  seizing the poor man  cried   what a fool you are   what is to prevent my eating you now  for after being cooped up so long i am terribly hungry    in vain the brahman pleaded for his life  the most he could gain was a promise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to question as to the justice of the tiger s action   so the brahman first asked a pipal tree what it thought of the matter  but the pipal tree replied coldly   what have you to complain about  don t i give shade and shelter to everyone who passes by  and don t they in return tear down my branches to feed their cattle   don t whimper be a  man     then the brahman sad at heart  went farther afield till he saw a buffalo turning a well wheel  but he fared no better from it  for it answered   you are a fool to expect gratitude   look at me   while i gave milk they fed me on cottonseed and oil cake  but now i am dry they yoke me here  and give me refuse as fodder    the brahman  still more sad  asked the road to give him its opinion    my dear sir    said the road   how foolish you are to expect anything else   here am i  useful to everybody  yet all  rich and poor  great and small  trample on me as they go past  giving me nothing but the ashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain    on this the brahman turned back sorrowfully  and on the way he met a jackal  who called out   why  what s the matter  mr  brahman   you look as miserable as a fish out of water    the brahman told him all that had occurred    how very confusing   said the jackal  when the recital was ended   would you mind telling me over again  for everything has got so mixed up    the brahman told it all over again  but the jackal shook his head in a distracted sort of way  and still could not understand    it s very odd   said he  sadly   but it all seems to go in at one ear and out at the other   i will go to the place where it all happened  and then perhaps i shall be able to give a judgment     so they returned to the cage  by which the tiger was waiting for the brahman  and sharpening his teeth and claws    you ve been away a long time   growled the savage beast   but now let us begin our dinner     our dinner   thought the wretched brahman  as his knees knocked together with fright   what a remarkably delicate way of putting it     give mime five minutes  my lord   he pleaded   in order that i may explain matters to the jackal here  who is somewhat slow in his wits    the tiger consented  and the brahman began the whole story over again  not missing a single detail  and spinning as long a yarn as possible     oh  my poor brain  oh  my poor brain   cried the jackal  wringing its paws    let me see  how did it all begin   you were in the cage  and the tiger came walking by     pooh   interrupted the tiger   what a fool you are   i was in the cage     of course   cried the jackal  pretending to tremble with fright   yes i was in the cage no i wasn t dear  dear  where are my wits   let me see the tiger was in the brahman  and the cage came walking by no  that s not it  either  well  don t mind me  but begin your dinner  for i shall never understand     yes  you shall   returned the tiger  in a rage at the jackal s stupidity   i ll make you understand   look here i am the tiger     yes  my lord     and that is the brahman     yes  my lord     and that is the cage     yes  my lord     and i was in the cage do you understand     yes no  please  my lord     well    cried the tiger impatiently    please  my lord   how did you get in     how  why  in the usual way  of course      oh  dear me  my head is beginning to whirl again  please don t get angry  my lord  but what is the usual way    at this the tiger lost patience  and  jumping into the cage  cried   this way   now do you understand how it was     perfectly   grinned the jackal  as he dexterously shut the door    and if you will permit me to say so  i think matters will remain as they were    the lambikin  by flora annie steel  once upon a time there was a wee wee lambikin  who frolicked about on his little tottery legs  and enjoyed himself amazingly   now one day he set off to visit his granny  and was jumping with joy to think of all the good things he should get from her  when who should he meet but a jackal  who looked at the tender young morsel and said   lambikin   lambikin   i ll eat you    but lambikin only gave a little frisk and said     to granny s house i go    where i shall fatter grow    then you can eat me so    the jackal thought this reasonable  and let lambikin pass   by and by he met a vulture  and the vulture  looking hungrily at the tender morsel before him  said   lambikin   lambikin   i ll eat you    but lambikin only gave a little frisk  and said     to granny s house i go    where i shall fatter grow    then you can eat me so    the vulture thought this reasonable  and let lambikin pass   and by and by he met a tiger  and then a wolf  and a dog  arid an eagle  and all these  when they saw the tender little morsel  said   lambikin   lambikin   i ll eat you    but to all of them lambikin replied  with a little frisk     to granny s house i go    where i shall fatter grow    then you can eat me so   at last he reached his granny s house  and said  all in a great hurry   granny  dear  i ve promised to get very fat  so  as people ought to keep their promises  please put me into the corn bin at once    so his granny said he was a good boy  and put him into the corn bin  and there the greedy little lambikin stayed for seven days  and ate  and ate  and ate  until he could scarcely waddle  and his granny said he was fat enough for anything  and must go home   but cunning little lambikin said that would never do  for some animal would be sure to eat him on the way back  he was so plump and tender    i ll tell you what you must do   said master lambikin   you must make a little drumikin out of the skin of  my little brother who died  and then i can sit inside and trundle along nicely  for i m as tight as a drum myself    so his granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother s skin  with the wool inside  and lambikin curled himself up snug and warm in the middle  and trundled away gayly   soon lie met with the eagle  who called out     drumikin   drumikin    have you seen lambikin    and mr  lambikin  curled up in his soft warm nest  replied     fallen into the fire  and so will you   on little drumikin   tum pa  tum too     how very annoying   sighed the eagle  thinking regretfully of the tender morsel he had let slip   meanwhile lambikin trundled along  laughing to himself  and singing     tum pa  tum too    tum pa  tum too    every animal and bird he met asked him the same question     drumikin   drumikin    have you seen lambikin    and to each of them the little slyboots replied     fallen into the fire  and so will you   on little drumikin  tum pa  tum too    tum pa  tum too  tum pa  tum too    then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had let slip   at last the jackal came limping along  for all his sorry looks as sharp as a needle  and he too called out     drumikin   drumikin    have you seen lambikin    and lambikin  curled up in his snug little nest  replied gayly     fallen into the fire  and so will you   on little drumikin   tum pa    but he never got any further  for the jackal recognized his voice at once  arid cried   hullo   you ve turned yourself inside out  have you  just you come out of that    whereupon he tore open drumikin and gobbled up lambikin   the rat s wedding  by flora annie steel  once upon a time a fat  sleek rat was caught in a shower of rain  and being far from shelter he set to work and soon dug a nice hole in the ground  in which he sat as dry as a bone while the raindrops splashed outside  making little puddles on the road   now in the course of digging  he came upon a fine bit of root  quite dry and fit for fuel  which he set aside carefully for the rat is an economical creature  in order to take it home with him   so when the shower was over  he set off with the dry root in his mouth   as he went along  daintily picking his way through the puddles  he saw a poor man vainly trying to light a fire  while a little circle of children stood by  and cried piteously    goodness gracious   exclaimed the rat  who was both soft hearted and curious   what a dreadful noise to make   what is the matter     the children are hungry   answered the man   they are crying for their breakfast  but the sticks are damp  the fire won t burn  and so i can t bake the cakes     if that is all your trouble  perhaps i can help you   said the good  natured rat   you are welcome to this dry root and i ll warrant it will soon make a fine blaze    the poor man  with a thousand thanks  took the dry root  and in his turn presented the rat with a morsel of dough  as a reward for his kindness and generosity    what a remarkably lucky fellow i am   thought the rat  as he trotted off gayly with his prize   and clever  too   fancy making a bargain like that food enough to last me five days in return for a rotten old stick   wah   wah   wah   what it is to have brains    going along  hugging his good fortune in this way  he came presently to a potter s yard  where the potter  leaving his wheel to spin round by itself  was trying to pacify his three little children  who were screaming arid crying as if they would burst    my gracious   cried the rat  stopping his ears   what a noise   do tell me what it is all about     i suppose they are hungry   replied the potter ruefully   their mother has gone to get flour in the bazaar  for there is none in the house  in the meantime i can neither work nor rest because of them     is that all   answered the officious rat  then i can help you   take this dough  cook it quickly  and stop their mouths with food    the potter overwhelmed the rat with thanks for his obliging kindness  and choosing out a nice well burned pipkin  insisted on his accepting it as a remembrance   the rat was delighted at the exchange  and though the pipkin was just a trifle awkward for him to manage  he succeeded  after infinite trouble  in balancing it on his head and went away gingerly  tink a tink  tin k  a tink  down the road  with his tail over his arm for fear he should trip on it   and all the time he kept saying to himself   what a lucky fellow i am   and clever  too   such a hand at a bargain    by and by he came to where some cowherds were herding their cattle  one of them was milking a buffalo  and having no pail  he used his shoes instead    oh fie   oh fie   cried the cleanly rat  quite shocked at the sight   what a nasty  dirty trick   why don t you use a pail     for the best of all reasons we haven t got one   growled the cowherd  who did not see why the rat should put his finger in the pie    if that is all   replied the dainty rat   oblige me by using this pipkin  for i cannot bear dirt    the cowherd  nothing loath  took the pipkin and milked away until it was brimming over  then turning to the rat  who stood looking on  said   here  little fellow  you may have a drink  in payment    but if the rat was good natured he was also shrewd    no  no  my friend   said he   that will not do   as if i could drink the worth of any pipkin at a draft   my dear sir  i couldn t hold it   besides  i never make a bad bargain  so i expect you  at least to give me the buffalo that gave the milk     nonsense   cried the cowherd   a buffalo for a pipkin   whoever heard of such a price   and what on earth could you do with a buffalo when you got it   why  the pipkin was about as much as you could manage    at this the rat drew himself up with dignity  for he did not like allusions to his size    that is my affair  not yours   he retorted   your business is to hand over the buffalo    so just for the fun of the thing  and to amuse themselves at the rat s expense  the cowherds loosened the buffalo s halter and began to tie it to the little animal s tail    no   no   he called  in a great hurry    if the beast pulled  the skin of my tail would come off  and then where should i be   tie it around my neck  if you please    so with much laughter the cowherds tied the halter round the rat s neck  and he  after a polite leave taking  set off gayly toward home with his prize  that is to say  he set off with the rope  for no sooner did he come to the end of the tether than be was brought up with a round turn  the buffalo  nose down  grazing away  would not budge until it had finished its tuft of grass  and then seeing another in a different direction marched off toward it  while the rat  to avoid being dragged  had to trot humbly behind  willy nilly   he was too proud to confess the truth  of course  and  nodding his head knowingly to the cowherds  said   ta ta  good people   i am going home this way  it may be a little longer  but it s much shadier    and when the cowherds roared with laughter he took no notice  but trotted on  looking as dignified as possible    after all   he reasoned to himself   when one keeps a buffalo one has to look after its grazing   a beast must get a good bellyful of grass if it is to give any milk  and i have plenty of time at my disposal    so all day long he trotted about after the buffalo  making believe  but by evening he was dead tired  and felt truly thankful when the great big beast  having eaten enough  lay down under a tree to chew the cud   just then a bridal party came by   the bridegroom and his friends had evidently gone on to the next village  leaving the bride s palanquin to follow  so the palanquin bearers  being lazy fellows and seeing a nice shady tree  put down their burden  and began to cook some food    what detestable meanness   grumbled one   a grand wedding  and nothing but plain rice to eat   not a scrap of meat in it  neither sweet nor salt   it would serve the skinflints right if we upset the bride into a ditch     dear me   cried the rat at once  seeing a way out of his difficulty   that is a shame   i sympathize with your feelings so entirely that if you will allow me  i ll give you my buffalo   you can kill it  and cook it     your buffalo   returned the discontented bearers    what rubbish  whoever heard of a rat owning a buffalo     not often  i admit   replied the rat with conscious pride   but look for yourselves   can you not see that i am leading the beast by a string     oh  never mind the string   cried a great big hungry bearer  master or no master  i mean to have meat for my dinner    whereupon they killed the buffalo  and cooking its flesh  ate their dinner with a relish  then  offering the remains to the rat  said carelessly   here  little rat skin  that is for you     now look here   cried the rat hotly   i ll have none of your pottage  or your sauce  either   you don t suppose i am going to give my best buffalo  that gave quarts and quarts of milk the buffalo i have been feeding all day for a wee bit of rice   no   i got a loaf for a bit of stick  i got a pipkin for a little loaf  i got a buffalo for a pipkin  and now i ll have the bride for my buffalo the bride  and nothing else    by this time the servants  having satisfied their hunger  began to reflect on what they had done  and becoming alarmed at the consequences  arrived at the conclusion it would be wisest to make their escape while they could   so  leaving the bride in her palanquin  they took to their heels in various directions   the rat  being as it were left in possession  advanced to the palanquin  and drawing aside the curtain  with the sweetest of voices and best of bows begged the bride to descend   she hardly knew whether to laugh or to cry  but as any company  even a rat s  was better than being quite alone in the wilderness  she did what she was bidden  and followed the lead of her guide  who set off as fast as be could for his hole   as he trotted along beside the lovely young bride  who  by her rich dress and glittering jewels  seemed to be some king s daughter  he kept saying to himself   how clever i am   what bargains i do make  to be sure    when they arrived at his hole  the rat stepped forward with the greatest politeness  and said   welcome  madam  to my humble abode  pray step in  or if you will allow me  and as the passage is somewhat dark  i will show you the way    whereupon he ran in first  but after a time  finding the bride did not follow  he put his nose out again  saying testily   well  madam  why don t you follow   don t you know it s rude to keep your husband waiting     my good sir   laughed the handsome young bride   i can t squeeze into that little hole    the rat coughed  then after a moment s thought he replied   there is some truth in your remark  you are overgrown  and i suppose i shall have to build you a thatch somewhere  for to night you can rest under that wild plum tree     but i am so hungry   said the bride ruefully    dear  dear   everybody seems hungry to day   returned the rat pettishly   however  that s easily settled i ll fetch you some supper in a trice    so he ran into his hole  returning immediately with an ear of millet and a dry pea    there   said he  triumphantly   isn t that a fine meal     i can t eat that   whimpered the bride   it isn t a mouthful  and i want rice pottage  and cakes  and sweet eggs  and sugar drops   i shall die if i don t get them     oh  dear me   cried the rat in a rage   what a nuisance a bride is  to be sure   why don t you eat the wild plums     i can t live on wild plums   retorted the weeping bride   nobody could  besides  they are only half ripe  and i can t reach them     rubbish   cried the rat   ripe or unripe  they must do you for to  night  and to morrow you can gather a basketful  sell them in the city  and buy sugar drops and sweet eggs to your heart s content    so the next morning the rat climbed up into the plum tree  and nibbled away at the stalks till the fruit fell down into the bride s veil  then  unripe as they were  she carried them into the city  calling out through the streets     green plums i sell   green plums i sell    princess am i  rat s bride as well    as she passed by the palace  her mother  the queen  heard her voice  and running out  recognized her daughter   great were the rejoicings  for everyone thought the poor bride had been eaten by wild beasts   in the midst of the feasting and merriment  the rat  who had followed the princess at a distance  and had become alarmed at her long absence  arrived at the door  against which he beat with a big knobby stick  calling out fiercely   give me my wife   give me my wife   she is mine by a fair bargain   i gave a stick and i got a loaf  i gave a loaf and i got a pipkin  i gave a pipkin and i got a buffalo  i gave a buffalo and i got a bride   give me my wife   give me my wife     la   son in law   what a fuss you do make   said the wily old queen through the door   and all about nothing   who wants to run away with your wife   on the contrary  we are proud to see you  and i only keep you waiting at the door till we can spread the carpets  and receive you in style    hearing this  the rat was mollified  and waited patiently outside while the cunning old queen prepared for his reception  which she did by cutting a hole in the very middle of a stool  putting a red hot stone underneath  covering it over with a stew pan lid  and then spreading a beautiful embroidered cloth over all   then she went to the door  and receiving the rat with the greatest respect  led him to the stool  praying him to be seated    dear   dear   how clever i am   what bargains i do make  to be sure   said he to himself as he climbed on to the stool    here i am  son in  law to a real live queen   what will the neighbors say    at first he sat down on the edge of the stool  but even there it was warm  and after a while he began to fidget  saying   dear me  mother  in law  how hot your house is   everything i touch seems burning     you are out of the wind there  my son   replied the cunning old queen   sit more in the middle of the stool  and then you will feel the breeze and get cooler    but he didn t   for the stewpan lid by this time had become so hot that the rat fairly frizzled when he sat down on it  and it was not until he had left all his tail  half his hair  and a large piece of his skin behind him  that he managed to escape  howling with pain  and vowing that never  never  never again would he make a bargain   the jackal and the partridge  by flora annie steel  a jackal and a partridge swore eternal friendship  but the jackal was very exacting and jealous    you don t do half as much for me as i do for you   he used to say   and yet you talk a great deal of your friendship   now my idea of a friend is one who is able to make me laugh or cry  give me a good meal  or save my life if need be   you couldn t do that     let us see   answered the partridge   follow me at a little distance  and if i don t make you laugh soon you may eat me    so she flew on till she met two travelers trudging along  one behind the other   they were both foot sore and weary  and the first carried his bundle on a stick over his shoulder  while the second had his shoes in his hand   lightly as a feather the partridge settled on the first traveler s stick   he  none the wiser  trudged on  but the second traveler  seeing the bird sitting so tamely just in front of his nose  said to himself   what a chance for a supper   and immediately flung his shoes at it  they being ready to hand   whereupon the partridge flew away  and the shoes knocked off the first traveler s turban    what a plague do you mean   cried he  angrily turning on his companion    why did you throw your shoes at my head     brother   replied the other mildly   do not be vexed   i didn t throw them at you  but at a partridge that was sitting on your stick     on my stick   do you take me for a fool   shouted the injured man  in a great rage    don t tell me such cock and bull stories   first you insult me  and then you lie like a coward  but i ll teach you manners    then he fell upon his fellow traveler without more ado  and they fought until they could not see out of their eyes  till their noses were bleeding  their clothes in rags  and the jackal had nearly died of laughing    are you satisfied   asked the partridge of her friend    well   answered the jackal   you have certainly made nine laugh  but i doubt if you could make me cry   it is easy enough to be a buffoon  it is more difficult to excite the highest emotions     let us see   retorted the partridge  somewhat piqued   there is a huntsman with his dogs coming along the road   just creep into that hollow tree and watch me  if you don t weep scalding tears  you must have no feeling in you    the jackal did as he was bid  and watched the partridge  who began fluttering about the bushes till the dogs caught sight of her  when she flew to the hollow tree where the jackal was hidden   of course the dogs smelt him at once  and set up such a yelping and scratching that the huntsman came up  and seeing what it was  dragged the jackal out by the tail   whereupon the dogs worried him to their heart s content  and finally left him for dead   by and by he opened his eyes for he was only foxing and saw the partridge sitting on a branch above him    did you cry   she asked anxiously    did i rouse your high emo       be quiet  will you   snarled the jackal  half dead with fear    so there the jackal lay for some time  getting the better of his bruises  and meanwhile he became hungry    now is the time for friendship   said he to the partridge    get me a good dinner  and i will acknowledge you a true friend     very well   replied the partridge   only watch me  and help yourself when the time comes    just then a troop of women came by  carrying their husbands dinners to the harvest field   the partridge gave a little plaintive cry  and began fluttering along from bush to bush as if she were wounded    a wounded bird   a wounded bird   cried the women   we can easily catch it    whereupon they set off in pursuit  but the cunning partridge played a thousand tricks  till they became so excited over the chase that they put their bundles on the ground in order to pursue it more nimbly   the jackal  meanwhile  seizing his opportunity  crept up  and made off with a good dinner    are you satisfied now   asked the partridge    well   returned the jackal   i confess you have given me a very good dinner  you have also made me laugh and cry ahem   but  after all  the great test of friendship is beyond you you couldn t save my life     perhaps not   acquiesced the partridge mournfully   i am so small and weak   but it grows late we should be getting home  and as it is a long way round by the ford  let us go across the river   my friend the crocodile will carry us over    accordingly they set off for the river  and the crocodile kindly consented to carry them across  so they sat on his broad back and he ferried them over   but just as they were in the middle of the stream the partridge remarked    i believe the crocodile intends to play us a trick   how awkward if he were to drop you into the water     awkward for you  too   replied the jackal  turning pale    not at all   not at all   i have wings  you haven t    on this the jackal shivered and shook with fear  and when the crocodile  in a gruesome growl  remarked that he was hungry and wanted a good meal  the wretched creature hadn t a word to say    pooh   cried the partridge airily   don t try tricks on us i should fly away  and as for my friend  the jackal  you couldn t hurt him   he is not such a fool as to take his life with him on these little excursions  he leaves it at home  locked up in the cupboard     is that a fact   asked the crocodile  surprised   certainly   retorted the partridge   try to eat him if you like  but you will only tire yourself to no purpose    dear me   how very odd   gasped time crocodile  and he was so taken aback that he carried the jackal safe to shore    well  are you satisfied now   asked the partridge    my dear madam   quoth the jackal   you have made me laugh  you have made me cry  you have given me a good dinner  and you have saved my life  but  upon my honor  i think you are too clever for a friend so good by    and the jackal never went near the partridge again   the jackal and the crocodile  by flora annie steel  once upon a time mr  jackal was trotting along gayly  when lie caught sight of a wild plum tree laden with fruit on the other side of a broad  deep stream   i could not get across anyhow  so he just sat down on the bank and looked at the ripe  luscious fruit until his mouth watered with desire   now it so happened that  just then  miss crocodile came floating down stream with her nose in the air    good morning  my dear   said mr  jackal politely   how beautiful you look to day  and how charmingly you swim   now  if i could only swim too  what a fine feast of plums we two friends might have over there together    and mr  jackal laid his paw on his heart  and sighed   now miss crocodile had a very inflammable heart  and when mr  jackal looked at her so admiringly  and spoke so sentimentally  she simpered and blushed  saying   oh   mr  jackal   how can you talk so   i could never dream of going out to dinner with you  unless unless     unless what   asked the jackal persuasively    unless we were going to be married   simpered miss crocodile    and why shouldn t we be married  my charmer   returned the jackal eagerly    i would go and fetch the barber to begin the betrothal at once  but i am so faint with hunger just at present that i should never reach the village   now  if the most adorable of her sex would only take pity on her slave  and carry me over the stream  i might refresh myself with those plums  and so gain strength to accomplish the ardent desire of my heart    here the jackal sighed so piteously  and cast such sheep s eyes at miss crocodile  that she was unable to withstand him   so she carried him across to the plum tree  and then sat on the water s edge to think over her wedding dress  while mr  jackal feasted on the plums and enjoyed himself    now for the barber  my beauty   cried the gay jackal  when he had eaten as much as he could   then the blushing miss crocodile carried him back again  and bade him be quick about his business  like a dear good creature  for really she felt so flustered at the very idea that she didn t know what might happen    now don t distress yourself  my dear   quoth the deceitful mr  jackal  springing to the bank   because it s not impossible that i may not find the barber  and then  you know  you may have to wait some time  a considerable time in fact  before i return   so don t injure your health for my sake  if you please    with that he blew her a kiss  and trotted away with his tail up   of course he never came back  though trusting miss crocodile waited patiently for him  at last she understood what a gay  deceitful fellow he was  and determined to have her revenge on him one way or another   so she hid herself in the water  under the roots of a tree  close to a ford where the jackal always came to drink   by and by   sure enough  he came lilting along in a self satisfied way  and went right into the water for a good long draft   whereupon miss crocodile seized him by the right legs and held on   he guessed at once what had happened  and called out   oh   my heart s adored   i m drowning   i m drowning   if you love me  leave hold of that old root and get a good grip of my leg  it is just next door    hearing this  miss crocodile thought she must have made a mistake  and  letting go the jackal s leg in a hurry  seized an old root close by  and held on   whereupon mr  jackal jumped nimbly to shore  and ran off with his tail up  calling out   have a little patience  my beauty   the barber will come some day    but this time miss crocodile knew better than to wait  and being now dreadfully angry  she crawled away to the jackal s hole  and  slipping inside  lay quiet   by and by mr  jackal came lilting along with his tail up    ho   ho  that is your game  is it   said he to himself  when he saw the trail of the crocodile in the sandy soil   so he stood outside  and said aloud   bless my stars   what has happened   i don t half like to go in  for whenever i come home my wife always calls out     oh  dearest hubby hub    what have you brought for grub   to me and the darling cub    and to day she doesn t say anything    hearing this  miss crocodile sang out from inside     oh  dearest hubby hub    what have you brought for grub   to me and the darling cub    the jackal winked a very big wink  and  stealing in softly  stood at the doorway   meanwhile miss crocodile  hearing him coming  held her breath  and lay  shamming dead  like a big log    bless my stars   cried mr  jackal  taking out his pocket handkerchief   how very sad   here s poor miss crocodile stone dead  and all for love of me   dear   dear   yet it is very odd  and i don t think she can be quite dead  you know for dead folks always wag their tails    on this  miss crocodile began to wag her tail very gently  and mr  jackal ran off  roaring with laughter  and saying    oho   oho   so dead folks always wag their tails    the jackal and the iguana  by flora annie steel  one moonlight night a miserable  half starved jackal  skulking through the village  found a worn out pair of shoes in the gutter   they were too tough for him to eat  so  determined to make some use of them  he strung them to his ears like earrings  and  going down to the edge of the pond  gathered all the old bones he could find together and built a platform of them  plastering it over with mud   on this he sat in a dignified attitude  and when any animal came to the pond to drink  he cried out in a loud voice   hi   stop   you must not taste a drop till you have done homage to me   so repeat these verses which i have composed in honor of the occasion     silver is his dais  plastered o er with gold    in his ears are jewels  some prince i must behold     now  as most of the animals were very thirsty  and in a great hurry to drink  they did not care to dispute the matter  but gabbled off the words without a second thought   even the royal tiger  treating it as a jest  repeated the jackal s rime  in consequence of which the latter became quite a cock a hoop  and really began to believe he was a personage of great importance   by and by an iguana  or big lizard  came waddling down to the water  looking for all the world like a baby alligator    hi   you there   sang out the jackal   you mustn t drink until you have said     silver is his dais  plastered o er with gold    in his ears are jewels  some prince i must behold      pouf   pouf   pouf   gasped the iguana    mercy on us  how dry my throat is   mightn t i have just a wee sip of water first   and then i could do justice to your admirable lines  at present i am as hoarse as a crow     by all means   replied the jackal  with a gratified smirk    i flatter myself the verses are good  especially when well recited    so the iguana  nose down in the water  drank away until the jackal began to think he would never leave off  and was quite taken aback when he finally came to an end of his draft  and began to move away    hi   hi   cried the jackal  recovering his presence of mind   stop a bit  and say       silver is his dais  plastered o er with gold    in his ears are jewels  some prince i must behold      dear me   replied the iguana  politely   i was very near forgetting  let me see i must try my voice first do  re  me  fa  sol  la  si that is right   now  how does it run      silver is his dais  plastered o er with gold    in his ears are jewels  some prince i must behold    repeated the jackal  not observing that the lizard was carefully edging farther and farther away    exactly so   returned the iguana   i think i could say that   whereupon he sang out at the top of his voice     bones made up his dais  with mud it s plastered o er    old shoes are his eardrops  a jackal  nothing more    and turning round  he bolted for his hole as hard as he could   the jackal could scarcely believe his ears  and sat dumb with astonishment   then  rage lending him wings  he flew after the lizard  who  despite his short legs and scanty breath  put his best foot foremost  and scuttled away at a great rate   it was a near race  however  for just as he popped into his hole  the jackal caught him by the tail  and held on   then it was a case of  pull  butcher  pull  baker   until the lizard made certain his tail must come off  and he felt as if his front teeth would come out   still not an inch did either budge  one way or the other  and there they might have remained till the present day  had not the iguana called out  in his sweetest tones   friend  i give in   just leave hold of my tail  will you   then i can turn round and come out    whereupon the jackal let go  and the tail disappeared up the hole in a twinkling  while all the reward the jackal got for digging away until his nails were nearly worn out was hearing the iguana sing softly     bones made up his dais  with mud it s plastered o er    old shoes are his eardrops  a jackal  nothing more  the bear s bad bargain  by flora annie steel  once upon a time a very old woodman lived with his very old wife in a tiny hut close to the orchard of a very rich man  so close that the boughs of a pear tree hung right over the cottage yard   now it was agreed between the rich man and the woodman that if any of the fruit fell into the yard  the old couple were to be allowed to eat it  so you may imagine with what hungry eyes they watched the pears ripening  and prayed for a storm of wind  or a flock of flying foxes  or anything which would cause the fruit to fall   but nothing came  and the old wife  who was a grumbling  scolding old thing  declared they would infallibly become beggars   so she took to giving her husband nothing but dry bread to eat  and insisted on his working harder than ever  till the poor soul got quite thin  and all because the pears would not fall down   at last the woodman turned round and declared he would not work more unless his wife gave him khichri for his dinner  so with a very bad grace the old woman took some rice and pulse  some butter and spices  and began to cook a savory khichri   what an appetizing smell it had  to be sure   the woodman was for gobbling it up as soon as ever it was ready    no  no   cried the greedy old wife  not till you have brought me in another load of wood  and mind it is a good one   you must work for your dinner    so the old man set off to the forest and began to hack and to hew with such a will that he soon had quite a large bundle  and with every faggot he cut he seemed to smell the savory khichri and think of the feast that was coming   just then a bear came swinging by  with its great black nose tilted in the air  and its little keen eyes peering about  for bears  though good enough fellows on the whole  are just dreadfully inquisitive    peace be with you  friend   said the bear   and what may you be going to do with that remarkably large bundle of wood     it is for my wife   returned the woodman    the fact is   he added confidentially  smacking his lips   she has made such a khichri for dinner   and if i bring in a good bundle of wood she is pretty sure to give me a plentiful portion   oh  my dear fellow  you should just smell that khichri    at this the bear s mouth began to water  for  like all bears  he was a dreadful glutton    do you think your wife would give mite some  too  if i brought her a bundle of wood   he asked anxiously    perhaps  if it is a very big load   answered the woodman craftily    would would four hundredweight be enough   asked the bear    i m afraid not   returned the  woodman  shaking his head   you see khichri is an expensive dish to make there is rice in it  and plenty of butter  and pulse  and     would would eight hundredweight do     say half a ton  and it s a bargain   quoth the woodman    half a ton is a large quantity   sighed the bear    there is saffron in the khichri   remarked the woodman  casually   the bear licked his lips  and his little eyes twinkled with greed and delight    well it s a bargain   go home sharp and tell your wife to keep the khichri hot  i ll be with you in a trice    away went the woodman in great glee to tell his wife how the bear had agreed to bring half a ton of wood in return for a share of the khichri   now the wife could not help allowing that her husband had made a good bargain  but being by nature a grumbler  she was determined not to be pleased  so she began to scold the old man for not having settled exactly the share the bear was to have    for   said she   he will gobble up the potful before we have finished our first helping    on this the woodman became quite pale    in that case   he said   we had better begin now  and have a fair start   so without more ado they squatted down on the floor  with the brass pot full of khichri between them  and began to eat as fast as they could    remember to leave some for the bear  wife   said the woodman  speaking with his mouth crammed full    certainly  certainly   she replied  helping herself to another handful    my dear   cried the old woman in her turn  with her mouth so full she could hardly speak   remember the poor bear     certainly  certainly  my love   returned the old man  taking another mouthful   so it went on  till there was not a single grain left in the pot    what s to be done now   said the woodman   it is all your fault  wife  for eating so much     my fault   retorted his wife scornfully   why  you ate twice as much as i did     no  i didn t     yes  you did  men always eat more than women    no  they don t     yes  they do     well  it s no use quarreling about it now   said the woodman   the khichri s gone  and the bear will be furious     that wouldn t matter much if we could get the wood   said the greedy old woman    i ll tell you what we must do we must lock up everything there is to eat in the house  leave the khichri pot by the fire  and hide in the garret   when the bear comes he will think we have gone out and left his dinner for him   then he will throw down his bundle and come in   of course he will rampage a little when he finds the pot is empty  but he can t do much mischief  and i don t think he will take the trouble of carrying the wood away    so they made haste to lock up all the food and hide themselves in the garret   meanwhile the bear had been toiling and moiling away at his bundle of wood  which took him much longer to collect than he expected  however  at last he arrived quite exhausted at the woodcutter s cottage   seeing the brass khichri pot by the fire  he threw down his load and went in  and then mercy   wasn t he angry when he found nothing in it not even a grain of rice  nor a tiny wee bit of pulse  but only a smell that was so uncommonly nice that he actually cried with rage and disappointment  he flew into the most dreadful temper  but though he turned the house topsy turvy  he could not find a morsel of food   finally  he declared he would take the wood away again  but  as the crafty old woman had imagined  when he came to the task  he did not care  even for the sake of revenge  to carry so heavy a burden    i won t go away empty handed   said he to himself  seizing the khichri pot   if i can t get the taste i ll have the smell    now  as he left the cottage  he caught sight of the beautiful golden pears hanging over into the yard   his mouth began to water at once  for he was desperately hungry  and the pears were the best of the season   in a trice he was on the wall  up the tree  and gathering the biggest and ripest one he could find  was just putting it into his mouth when a thought struck him    if i take these pears home i shall be able to sell them for ever so much to the other bears  and then with the money i shall be able to buy some khichri   ha  ha   i shall have the best of the bargain after all    so saying  he began to gather the ripe pears as fast as he could and put them in the khichri pot  but whenever he came to an unripe one he would shake his head and say   no one would buy that  yet it is a pity to waste it    so he would pop it into his mouth and eat it  making wry faces if it was very sour   now all this time the woodman s wife had been watching the bear through a crevice  and holding her breath for fear of discovery  but  at last  what with being asthmatic  and having a cold in her head  she could hold it no longer  and just as the khichri pot was quite full of golden ripe pears  out she came with the most tremendous sneeze you ever heard  a h che u     the bear  thinking some one had fired a gun at him  dropped the khichri pot into the cottage yard  and fled into the forest as fast as his legs would carry him   so the woodrnan and his wife got the khichri  the wood  and the coveted pears  but the poor bear got nothing but a very bad stomachache from eating unripe fruit   the thief and the fox  by ramaswarni raju  a man tied his horse to a tree and went into an inn   a thief hid the horse in a wood  and stood near the tree as if he had not done it    did you see my horse   said the man    yes   said the thief   i saw the tree eat up your horse      how could the tree eat up my horse   said the man    why it did so   said the thief   the two went to a fox and told him of the case   the fox said    i am dull   all last night the sea was on fire  i had to throw a great deal of hay into it to quench the flames  so come to morrow  and i shall hear your case    oh  you lie   said the thief   how could the sea burn   how could hay quench the flames     oh  you lie   said the fox  with a loud laugh   how could a tree eat up a horse    the thief saw his lie had no legs  and gave the man his horse   the farmer and the fox  by ramaswami raju  a farmer was returning from a fair which he had attended the previous day at a neighboring market town   he had a quantity of poultry which he had purchased   a fox observed this  and approaching the farmer  said   good morning  my friend     what cheer  old fellow   said the farmer    i am just coming from the wood  through which you mean to go with your poultry   a band of highwaymen has been tarrying there since daybreak     then what shall i do   said the farmer    why   said the fox   if i were you i should stay here a while  and after breakfast enter the wood  for by that time the robbers will have left the place     so be it   said the farmer  and had a hearty breakfast  with reynard for his guest   they kept drinking for a long time   reynard appeared to have lost his wits  he stood up and played the drunkard to perfection   the farmer  who highly admired the pranks of his guest  roared with laughter  and gradually fell into a deep slumber   it was some time after noon when he awoke   to his dismay he found that the fox was gone  and that the poultry had all disappeared    alas   said the farmer  as he trudged on his way home with a heavy heart   i thought the old rogue was quite drowned in liquor  but i now see it was all a pretense   one must indeed be very sober to play the drunkard to perfection    the fools and the drum  by ramaswami raju  two fools heard a drum sounding  and said to themselves  there is some one inside it who makes the noise    so  watching a moment  when the drummer was out  they pierced a hole in each side of it  and pushed their hands in   each felt the hand of the other within the drum  and exclaimed   i have caught him    then one said to the other   brother  the fellow seems to be a stubborn knave  come what will  we should not give in     not an inch  brother   said the other   so they kept pulling each other s hand  fancying it was the man in the drum   the drummer came up  and finding them in such an awkward plight showed them with his fist who the man in the drum really was   but as his fine drum was ruined  he said  with a sigh   alas   fools have fancies with a triple wing    the lion and the goat  by ramaswami raju  a lion was eating up one after another the animals of a certain country   one day an old goat said   we must put a stop to this   i have a plan by which he may be sent away from this part of the country     pray act up to it at once   said the other animals   the old goat laid himself down in a cave on the roadside  with his flowing beard and long curved horns   the lion  on his way to the village  saw him  and stopped at the mouth of the cave    so you have come  after all   said the goat    what do you mean   said the lion    why  i have long been lying in this cave   i have eaten up one hundred elephants  a hundred tigers  a thousand wolves  and ninety nine lions  one more lion has been wanting   i have waited long and patiently  heaven has  after all  been kind to me   said the goat  and shook his horns and his beard  and made a start as if he were about to spring upon the lion   the latter said to himself   this animal looks like a goat  but it does not talk like one   so it is very likely some wicked spirit in this shape   prudence often serves us better than valor  so for the present i shall return to the wood   and he turned back   the goat rose up  and  advancing to the mouth of the cave  said   will you come back tomorrow     never again   said the lion    do you think i shall be able to see you  at least  in the wood to  morrow     neither in the wood nor in this neighborhood any more   said the lion  and running to the forest  soon left it with his kindred   the animals in the country  not hearing him roar any more  gathered round the goat  and said   the wisdom of one doth save a host    the glowworm and the jac kdaw  by ramaswami raju  jackdaw once ran up to a glowworm and was about to seize him    wait a moment  good friend   said the worm   and you shall hear something to your advantage     ah   what is it   said the daw    i am but one of the many glowworms that live in this forest   if you wish to have them all  follow me   said the glowworm    certainly   said the daw   then the glowworm led him to a place in the wood where a fire had been kindled by some woodmen  and pointing to the sparks flying about  said   there you find the glowworms warming themselves round a fire   when you have done with them i shall show you some more  at a distance from this place    the daw darted at the sparks and tried to swallow some of them  but his mouth being burned by the attempt  he ran away exclaiming   ah  the glowworm is a dangerous little creature    the camel and the pig  by ramaswami raju  a camel said   nothing like being tall   look how tall i am    a pig  who heard these words  said   nothing like being short   look how short i am    the camel said   well  if i fail to prove the truth of what i said   i shall give up my hump    the pig said   if i fail to prove the truth of what i have said  i shall give up my snout     agreed   said the camel    just so   said the pig   they came to a garden  inclosed by a low wall without any opening   the camel stood on this side of the wall  and reaching the plants within by means of his long neck  made a breakfast on them   then he turned  jeeringly to the pig  who had been standing at the bottom of the wall  without even having a look at the good things in the garden  and said   now  would you be tall or short    next they came to a garden  inclosed by a high wall  with a wicket gate at one end   the pig entered by the gate  and  after having eaten his fill of the vegetables within  came out  laughing at the poor camel  who had had to stay outside because he was too tall to enter the garden by the gate  and said   now  would you be tall or short    then they thought the matter over and came to the conclusion that the camel should keep his hump and the pig his snout  observing   tall is good  where tall would do  of short  again   tis also true    the dog and   the dog dealer  by ramaswami raju  a dog was standing by the cottage of a peasant   a man who dealt in dogs passed by the way   the dog said   will you buy me    the man said   oh  you ugly little thing   i would not give a quarter of a penny for you    then the dog went to the palace of the king and stood by the portal  the sentinel caressed it  and said   you are a charming little creature    just then the dog dealer came by   the dog said   will you buy me     oh   said the man   you guard the palace of the king  who must have paid a high price for you   i cannot afford to pay the amount  else i would willingly take you     ah   said the dog   how place and position affect people    the tiger  the fox  and the hunters  by ramaswami raju  a fox was once caught in a trap   a hungry tiger saw him and said   so you are here     only on your account   said the fox in a whisper    how so   said the tiger    why  you were complaining you could not get men to eat  so i got into this net to day  that you may have the men when they come to take me   said the fox  and gave a hint that if he would wait a while in a thicket close by he would point out the men to him    may i depend upon your word   said the tiger    certainly   said the fox   the hunters came  and seeing the fox in the net  said   so you are here     only on your account   said the fox  in a whisper    how so   said the men    why  you were complaining you could not get at the tiger that has been devouring your cattle  i got into this net to day that you may have him   as i expected  he came to eat me up  and is in yonder thicket    said the fox  and gave a hint that if they would take him out of the trap he would point out the tiger    may we depend upon your word   said the men    certainly   said the fox  while the men went with him in a circle to see that he did not escape   then the fox said to the tiger and the men   sir tiger  here are the men  gentlemen  here is the tiger    the men left the fox and turned to the tiger   the former beat a hasty retreat to the wood  saying   i have kept my promise to both  now you may settle it between yourselves    the tiger exclaimed  when it was too late   alas   what art for a double part     the sea  the fox  and the wolf  by ramaswami raju  a fox that lived by the seashore once met a  wolf that had never seen the sea   the wolf said   what is the sea     it is a great piece of water by my dwelling   said the fox    is it under your control   said the wolf    certainly   said the fox    will you show me the sea  then   said the wolf    with pleasure   said the fox   so the fox led the wolf to the sea and said to the waves   now go back  they went back    now come up   and they came up   then the fox said to the waves   my friend  the wolf  has come to see you  so you will come up and go back till i bid you stop  and the wolf saw with wonder the waves coming up and going back   he said to the fox   may i go into the sea     as far as you like   don t be afraid  for at a word  the sea would go or come as i bid  and as you have already seen    the wolf believed the fox  and followed the waves rather far from the shore   a great wave soon upset him  and threw his carcass on the shore   the fox made a hearty breakfast on it   the fox in the well  by ramaswami raju  a fox fell into a well and was holding hard to some roots at the side of it  just above the water   a wolf  who was passing by  saw him  and said   hello  reynard  after all you have fallen into a well     but not without a purpose  and not without the means of getting out of it   said the fox    what do you mean   said the wolf    why   said the fox   there is a drought all over the country now  and the water in this well is the only means of appeasing the thirst of the thousands that live in this neighborhood   they held a meeting  and requested me to keep the water from going down lower  so i am holding it up for the public good     what will be your reward   said the  wolf    they will give me a pension  and save me the trouble of going about every day in quest of food  not to speak of innumerable other privileges that will be granted me   further  i am not to stay here all day   i have asked a kinsman of mine  to whom i have communicated the secret of holding up the water  to relieve me from time to time   of course he will also get a pension  and have other privileges   i expect him here shortly     ah  reynard  may i relieve you  then   may i hope to get a pension and other privileges   you know what a sad lot is mine  especially in winter     certainly   said the fox   but you must get a long rope  that i may come up and let you in   so the wolf got a rope   up came the fox and down went the wo1f  when the former observed  with a laugh   my dear sir  you may remain there till doomsday  or till the owner of the well throws up your carcass   and left the place   ashiepattle and his goodly crew  by p  c  asbj rnsen  once upon a time there was a king  and this king had heard about a ship which went just as fast by land as by water  and as he wished to have one like it  he promised his daughter and half the kingdom to anyone who could build one for him   and this was given out at every church all over the country   there were many who tried  as you can imagine  for they thought it would be a nice thing to have half the kingdom  and the princess wouldn t be a bad thing into the bargain   but they all fared badly   now there were three brothers  who lived far away on the borders of a forest  the eldest was called peter  the second paul  and the youngest espen ashiepattle  because he always sat in the hearth  raking and digging in the ashes   it so happened that ashiepattle was at church on the sunday when the proclamation about the ship  which the king wanted  was read   when he came home amid told his family  peter  the eldest  asked his mother to get some food ready for him  for now he was going away to try if he could build the ship and win the princess and half the kingdom   when the bag was ready lie set out   on the way he met an old man who was very crooked and decrepit    where are you going   said the man    i m going into the forest to make a trough for my father   he doesn t like to eat at table in our company   said peter    trough it shall he   said the man    what have you got in that bag of yours   he added    stones   said peter    stones it shall be   said the man   peter then went into the forest and began to cut and chop away at the trees and work away as hard as he could  but in spite of all his cutting and chopping he could only turn out troughs   toward dinner time he wanted something to eat and opened his bag   but there was not a crumb of food in it   as he had nothing to live upon  and as he did not turn out anything but troughs  he became tired of the work  took his ax and bag on his shoulder  and went home to his mother   paul then wanted to set out to try his luck at building the ship and winning the princess and half the kingdom   he asked his mother for provisions  and when the bag was ready he threw it over his shoulder and went on his way to the forest   on the road he met the old man  who was very crooked and decrepit    where are you going   said the man    oh  i am going into the forest to make a trough for our sucking pig   said paul    pig trough it shall be   said the man    what have you got in that bag of yours   added the man    stones   said paul     stones it shall be   said the man   paul then began felling trees and working away as hard as he could  but no matter how he cut and how he worked he could only turn out pig troughs   he did not give in  however  but worked away till far into the afternoon before he thought of taking any food  then all at once he became hungry and opened his bag  but not a crumb could he find   paul became so angry he turned the bag inside out and struck it against the stump of a tree  then lie took his ax  went out of the forest  and set off homeward   as soon as paul returned  ashiepattle wanted to set out and asked his mother for a bag of food    perhaps i can manage to build the ship and win the princess and half the kingdom   said he    well  i never heard the like   said his mother    are you likely to win the princess  you  who never do anything but root and dig in the ashes   no  you shan t have any bag with food    ashiepattle did not give in  however  but he prayed and begged till he got leave to go   he did not get any food  not he  but he stole a couple of oatmeal cakes and some flat beer and set out   when he had walked a while he met the same old man  who was so crooked and tattered and decrepit     where are you going   said the man    oh  i was going into the forest to try if it were possible to build a ship which can go as fast by land as by water   said ashiepattle   for the king has given out that anyone who can build such a ship shall have the princess and half the kingdom     what have you got in that bag of yours   said the man    not much worth talking about  there ought to be a little food in it   answered ashiepattle    if you ll give me a little of it i ll help you  said the man    with all my heart   said ashiepattle   but there is nothing but some oatmeal cakes and a drop of flat beer    it didn t matter what it was  the man said  if he only got some of it he would be sure to help ashiepattle   when they came up to an old oak in the wood the man said to the lad   now you must cut off a chip and then put it back again in exactly the same place  and when you have done that you can lie down and go to sleep    ashiepattle did as he was told and then lay down to sleep  and in his sleep lie thought he heard somebody cutting and hammering and sawing and carpentering  but he could not wake up till the man called him  then the ship stood quite finished by the side of the oak    now you must go on board and everyone you meet you must take with you   said the man   espen ashiepattle thanked him for the ship  said he would do so  and then sailed away   when he had sailed some distance he came to a long  thin tramp  who was lying near some rocks  eating stones    what sort of a fellow are you  that you lie there eating stones   asked ashiepattle   the tramp said he was so fond of meat he could never get enough  therefore he was obliged to eat stones   and then he asked if he might go with him in the ship    if you want to go with us  you must make haste and get on board   said ashiepattle   yes  that he would  but he must take with him some large stones for food   when they had sailed some distance they met one who was lying on the side of a sunny hill  sucking at a bung    who are you   said ashiepattle   and what is the good of lying there sucking that bung     oh  when one hasn t got the barrel  one must be satisfied with the bung   said the man    i m always so thirsty  i can never get enough beer and wine    and then he asked for leave to go with him in the ship    if you want to go with me you must make haste and get on board   said ashiepattle   yes  that he would   and so he went on board and took the bung with him to allay his thirst   when they had sailed a while again they met one who was lying with his ear to the ground  listening    who are you  and what is the good of lying there on the ground listening   said ashiepattle    i m listening to the grass  for i have such good ears that i can hear the grass growing   said the man   and then he asked leave to go with him in the ship   ashiepattle could not say nay to that  so he said    if you want to go with me  you must make haste and get on board    yes  the man would   and he also went on board   when they had sailed some distance they came to one who was standing taking aim with a gun    who are you  and what is the good of standing there aiming like that   asked ashiepattle   so the man said   i have such good eyes that i can hit anything  right to the end of the world   and then he asked for leave to go with him in the ship    if you want to go with me  you must make haste and get on board   said ashiepattle   yes  that he would   and he went on board   when they had sailed some distance again they came to one who was hopping and limping about on one leg  and on the other he had seven ton weights    who are you  said ashiepattle   and what is the good of hopping and limping about on one leg with seven ton weights on the other     i am so light   said the man   that if i walked on both my legs i should get to the end of the world in less than five minutes   and then he asked for leave to go with him in the ship    if you want to go with us  you must make haste and get on board   said ashiepattle   yes  that he would   and so he joined ashiepattle and his crew on the ship   when they had sailed on some distance they met one who was standing holding his hand to his mouth    who are you   said ashiepattle   and what is the good of standing there  holding your mouth like that     oh  i have seven summers and fifteen winters in my body   said the man   so i think i ought to keep my mouth shut  for if they get out all at the same time they would finish off the world altogether    and then he asked for leave to go with him in the ship    if you want to go with us you must make haste and get on board   said ashiepattle   yes  that he would  and then he joined the others on the ship   when they had sailed a long time they came to the king s palace   ashiepattle went straight in to the king and said the ship stood ready in the courtyard outside  and now he wanted the princess  as the king had promised   the king did not like this very much  for ashiepattle did not cut a very fine figure  he was black and sooty  and the king did not care to give his daughter to such a tramp  so he told ashiepattle that he would have to wait a little    but you can have her all the same  if by this time to morrow you can empty my storehouse of three hundred barrels of meat   said the king    i suppose i must try   said ashiepattle   but perhaps you don t mind my taking one of my crew with me     yes  you can do that  and take all six if you like   said the king  for he was quite sure that even if ashiepattle took six hundred with him  it would be impossible   so ashiepattle took with him the one who ate stones and always hungered after meat   when they came next morning and opened the storehouse they found he had eaten all the meat  except six small legs of mutton  one for each of his companions   ashiepattle then went to the king and said the storehouse was empty  and he supposed he could now have the princess   the king went into the storehouse and  sure enough  it was quite empty  but ashiepattle was still black and sooty  and the king thought it was really too bad that such a tramp should have his daughter   so he said he had a cellar full of beer and old wine  three hundred barrels of each kind  which he would have him drink first    i don t mind your having my daughter if you can drink them up by this time to morrow   said the king    i suppose i must try   said ashiepattle   but perhaps you don t mind my taking one of my crew with me     yes  you may do that   said the king  for he was quite sure there was too much beer and wine even for all seven of them   ashiepattle took with him the one who was always sucking the bung and was always thirsty  and the king then shut them down in the cellar   there the thirsty one drank barrel after barrel  as long as there was any left  but in the last barrel he left a couple of pints to each of his companions   in the morning the cellar was opened and ashiepattle went at once to the king and said he had finished the beer and wine  and now he supposed he could have the princess as the king had promised    well  i must first go down to the cellar and see   said the king  for he could not believe it  but when he got there he found nothing but empty barrels   but ashiepattle was both black and sooty and the king thought it wouldn t do for him to have such a son in law   so he said that if ashiepattle could get water from the end of the world in ten minutes for the princess s tea  he could have both her and half the kingdom  for he thought that task would be quite impossible    i suppose i must try   said ashiepattle  and sent for the one of his crew who jumped about on one leg and had seven ton weights on the other  and told him he must take off the weights and use his legs as quickly as he could  for he must have water from the end of the world for the princess s tea in ten minutes   so he took off the weights  got a bucket  and set off  and the next moment he was out of sight   but they waited and waited and still he did not return   at last it wanted but three minutes to the time and the king became as pleased as if he had won a big wager   then ashiepattle called the one who could hear the grass grow and told him to listen and find out what had become of their companion    he has fallen asleep at the well    said he who could hear the grass grow   i can hear him snoring  and a troll is scratching his head   ashiepattle then called the one who could shoot to the end of the world and told him to send a bullet into the troll  he did so and hit the troll right in the eye   the troll gave such a yell that he woke the man who had come to fetch the water for the tea  and when he returned to the palace there was still one minute left out of the ten   ashiepattle went straight to the king and said    here is the water   and now he supposed he could have the princess  for surely the king would not make any more fuss about it now   but the king thought that ashiepattle was just as black and sooty as ever  and did not like to have him for a son in law  so he said he had three hundred fathoms of wood with which he was going to dry corn in the bakehouse  and he wouldn t mind ashiepattle having his daughter if he would first sit in the bakehouse and burn all the wood  he should then have the princess  and that without fail    i suppose i must try   said ashiepattle   but perhaps you don t mind my taking one of my crew with me     oh  no  you can take all six   said the king  for he thought it would be warm enough for all of them   ashiepattle took with him the one who had fifteen winters and seven summers in his body  and in the evening he went across to the bakehouse  but the king had piled up so much wood on the fire that you might almost have melted iron in the room   they could not get out of it  for no sooner were they inside than the king fastened the bolt and put a couple of padlocks on the door besides   ashiepattle then said to his companion    you had better let out six or seven winters  so that we may get something like summer weather here    they were then just able to exist  but during the night it got cold again and ashiepattle then told the man to let out a couple of summers  and so they slept far into the next day   but when they heard the king outside ashiepattle said    you must let out a couple more winters  but you must manage it so that the last winter you let out strikes the king right in the face    he did so  and when the king opened the door  expecting to find ashiepattle and his companion burned to cinders  he saw them huddling together and shivering with cold till their teeth chattered   the same instant ashiepattle s companion with the fifteen winters in his body let loose the last one right in the king s face  which swelled up into a big chilblain    can i have the princess now   asked ashiepattle   yes  take her and keep her and the kingdom into the bargain   said the king  who dared not refuse any longer   and so the wedding took place and they feasted and made merry and fired off guns and powder   while the people were running about searching for wadding for their guns  they took me instead  gave me some porridge in a bottle and some milk in a basket  and fired me right across here  so that i could tell you how it all happened   the squire s bride  by p   c   asbj rnsen  once upon a time there was a rich squire who owned a large farm  and had plenty of silver at the bottom of his chest and money in the bank besides  but he felt there was something wanting  for he was a widower   one day the daughter of a neighboring farmer was working for him in the hayfield   the squire saw her and liked her very much  and as she was the child of poor parents he thought if he only hinted that he wanted her she would be ready to marry him at once   so he told her he had been thinking of getting married again    aye   one may think of many things   said the girl  laughing slyly   in her opinion the old fellow ought to be thinking of something that behooved him better than getting married    well  you see  i thought that you should be my wife     no  thank you all the same   said she   that s not at all likely    the squire was not accustomed to be gainsaid  and the more she refused him the more determined he was to get her   but as he made no progress in her favor he sent for her father and told him that if he could arrange the matter with his daughter he would forgive him the money he had lent him  and he would also give him the piece of land which lay close to his meadow into the bargain    yes  you may be sure i ll bring my daughter to her senses   said the father    she is only a child  and she doesn t know what s best for her    but all his coaxing and talking did not help matters   she would not have the squire  she said  if he sat buried in gold up to his ears   the squire waited day after day  but at last he became so angry and impatient that he told the father  if he expected him to stand by his promise  he would have to put his foot down and settle the matter now  for he would not wait any longer   the man knew no other way out of it but to let the squire get everything ready for the wedding  and when the parson and the wedding guests had arrived the squire should send for the girl as if she were wanted for some work on the farm   when she arrived she would have to be married right away  so that she would have no time to think it over   the squire thought this was well and good  and so he began brewing and baking and getting ready for the wedding in grand style   when the guests had arrived the squire called one of his farm lads and told him to run down to his neighbor and ask him to send him what he had promised    but if you are not back in a twinkling   he said  shaking his fist at him   i ll    he did not say more  for the lad ran off as if he had been shot at    my master has sent me to ask for that you promised him   said the lad  when he got to the neighbor   but there is no time to be lost  for he is terribly busy to day     yes  yes   run down into the meadow and take her with you   there she goes   answered the neighbor   the lad ran off and when he came to the meadow he found the daughter there raking the hay    i am to fetch what your father has promised my master   said the lad    ah  ha   thought she    is that what they are up to     ah  indeed   she said    i suppose it s that little bay mare of ours  you had better go and take her   she stands there tethered on the other side of the pea field   said the girl   the boy jumped on the back of the bay mare and rode home at full gallop    have you got her with you   asked the squire    she is down at the door   said the lad    take her up to the room my mother had   said the squire    but master  how can that be managed   said the lad    you must just do as i tell you   said the squire    if you cannot manage her alone you must get the men to help you   for he thought the girl might turn obstreperous   when the lad saw his master s face he knew it would be no use to gainsay him   so he went and got all the farm tenants who were there to help him   some pulled at the head and the forelegs of the mare and others pushed from behind  and at last they got her up the stairs and into the room   there lay all the wedding finery ready    now  that s done master   said the lad   but it was a terrible job  it was the worst i have ever had here on the farm    never mind  you shall not have done it for nothing   said his master   now send the women up to dress her     but i say master    said the lad    none of your talk   said the squire    tell them they must dress her and mind and not forget either wreath or crown   the lad ran into the kitchen    look here  lasses   he said   you must go upstairs and dress up the bay mare as bride   i expect the master wants to give the guests a laugh    the women dressed the bay mare in everything that was there  and then the lad went and told his master that now she was ready dressed  with wreath and crown and all    very well  bring her down   said the squire    i will receive her myself at the door   said he   there was a terrible clatter on the stairs  for that bride  you know  had no silken shoes on   when the door was opened and the squire s bride entered the parlor you can imagine there was a good deal of tittering and grinning   and as for the squire you may he sure line had had enough of that bride  and they say he never went courting again   the doll in the grass  by p   c   asbj rnsen  once upon a time there was a king who had twelve sons   when they were grown up he told them they must go out into the world and find themselves wives  who must all be able to spin and weave and make a shirt in one day  else he would not have them for daughters in law   he gave each of his sons a horse and a new suit of armor  and so they set out in the world to look for wives   when they had traveled a bit on the way they said they would not take ashiepattle with them  for he was good for nothing   ashiepattle must stop behind  there was no help for it   he did not know what he should do or which way he should turn  he became so sad that he got off the horse and sat down on the grass and began to cry   when he had sat a while one of the tussocks among the grass began to move  and out of it came a small white figure  as it came nearer ashiepattle saw that it was a beautiful little girl  but she was so tiny  so very  very tiny   she went up to him and asked him if he would come below and pay a visit to the doll in the grass   yes  that he would  and so he did   when he came down below  the doll in the grass was sitting in a chair dressed very finely and looking still more beautiful   she asked ashiepattle where he was going and what was his errand   he told her they were twelve brothers  and that the king had given them each a horse and a suit of armor  and told them to go out in the world and find themselves wives  but they must all be able to spin and weave and make a shirt in a day    if you can do that and will become my wife  i will not travel any farther   said ashiepattle to the doll in the grass   yes  that she would  and she set to work at once to get the shirt spun  woven  and made  but it was so tiny  so very  very tiny  no bigger than so   ashiepattle then returned home  taking the shirt with him  but when he brought it out he felt very shy because it was so small   but the king said he could have her for all that  and you can imagine how happy and joyful ashiepattle became   the road did not seem long to him as he set out to fetch his little sweetheart   when he came to the doll in the grass he wanted her to sit with him on his horse  but no  that she wouldn t  she said she would sit and drive in a silver spoon  and she had two small while horses which would draw her   so they set out  he on his horse and she in the silver spoon  and the horses which drew her were two small white mice   ashiepattle always kept to one side of the road  for he was so afraid he should ride over her  she was so very  very tiny   when they had traveled a bit on the way they came to a large lake  there ashiepattle s horse took fright and shied over to the other side of the road  and upset the spoon  so that the doll in the grass fell into the water   ashiepattle became very sad  for he did not know how he should get her out again  but after a while a merman brought her up   but now she had become just as big as any other grown up being and was much more beautiful than she was before   so he placed her in front of him on the horse and rode home   when ashiepattle got there all his brothers had also returned  each with a sweetheart  but they were so ugly and ill favored and bad  tempered that they had come to blows with their sweethearts on their way home   on their heads they had hats which were painted with tar and soot  and this had run from their hats down their faces  so that they were still uglier and more ill favored to behold   when the brothers saw ashiepattle s sweetheart they all became envious of him  but the king was so pleased with ashiepattle and his sweetheart that he drove all the others away  and so ashiepattle was married to the doll in the grass  and afterward they lived happy and comfortable for a long  long while  and if they are not dead  they must be still alive   the bear and the fox  by p   c   asbj rnsen  once upon a time there was a bear  who sat on a sunny hillside taking a nap   just then a fox came slinking by and saw him    aha   have i caught you napping  grandfather   see if i don t play you a trick this time   said reynard to himself   he then found three wood mice and laid them on a stump of a tree just under the bear s nose    boo   bruin   peter the hunter is just behind that stump   shouted the fox right into the bear s ear  and then took to his heels and made off into the wood   the bear woke at once  and when he saw the three mice he became so angry that he lifted his paw and was just going to strike them  for he thought it was they who had shouted in his ear   but just then he saw reynard s tail between the bushes and he set off at such a speed that the branches crackled under him  and bruin was soon so close upon reynard that he caught him by the right hind leg just as be was running into a hole under a pine tree   reynard was now in a fix  but he was not to be outwitted  and he cried    slip pine root  grip fox foot   and so the bear let go his hold  but the fox laughed far down in the hole and said    i sold you that time  also  grandfather     out of sight is not out of mind   said the bear  who was in a fine fury     the other morning  when bruin came trudging across the moor with a fat pig  master reynard was lying on a stone by the moorside    good day  grandfather   said the fox    what nice thing have you got there     pork   said the bear    i have got something tasty as well   said the fox    what s that   said the bear    it s the biggest bees  nest i ever found   said reynard    ah  indeed   said the bear  grinning  and his mouth began to water  he thought a little honey would be so nice    shall we change victuals   he said    no  i won t do that   said reynard   but they made a wager about naming three kinds of trees   if the fox could say them quicker than the bear he was to have one bite at the pig  but if the bear could say them quicker he was to have one suck at the bee s nest   the bear thought he would be able to suck all the honey up at one gulp    well said the fox   that s all well and good but if i win you must promise to tear off the bristles where i want to have a bite   he said    well  i suppose i must  since you are too lazy yourself   said the bear   then they began to name the trees    spruce  fir  pine   growled the bear   his voice was very gruff   but all these were only different names of one kind of tree    ash  aspen  oak   screeched the fox  so that the forest resounded   he had thus won the bet  and so he jumped down  took the heart out of the pig at one bite  and tried to run off   but the bear was angry  because he had taken the best bit of the whole pig  and seized hold of him by his tail and held him fast    just wait a bit   said the bear  who was furious    never mind  grandfather  if you ll let me go you shall have a taste of my honey   said the fox   when the bear heard this he let go his hold and the fox jumped up on the stone after the honey    over this nest   said reynard   i ll put a leaf  and in the leaf there is a hole  through which you can suck the honey    he then put the nest right up under the bear s nose  pulled away the leaf  jumped on to the stone  and began grinning and laughing  for there was neither honey nor honeycomb in the nest   it was a wasp s nest as big as a man s head  full of wasps  and out they swarmed and stung the bear in his eyes and ears and on his mouth and snout   he had so much to do with scratching them off him that he had no the to think of reynard   ever since the bear has been afraid of wasps      once the fox and the bear made up their minds to have a field in common   they found a small clearing far away in the forest  where they sowed rye the first year    now we must share and share alike   said reynard   if you will have the roots i will have the tops   he said   yes  bruin was quite willing  but when they had thrashed the crop the fox got all the corn  while the bear got nothing but the roots and tares   bruin didn t like this  but the fox said it was only as they had agreed    this year i am the gainer   said the fox   another year it will be your turn  you can then have the tops and i will be satisfied with the roots    next spring the fox asked the bear if he didn t think turnips would be the right thing for that year    yes  that s better food than corn   said the bear  and the fox thought the same   when the autumn came the fox took the turnips  but the bear only got the tops   the bear then became so angry that he parted company then and there with reynard      one day the bear was lying eating a horse which he had killed   reynard was about again and came slinking along  his mouth watering for a tasty bit of the horseflesh   he sneaked in and out and round about till he came up behind the bear  when he made a spring to the other side of the carcass  snatching a piece as he jumped across   the bear was not slow either  he made a dash after reynard and caught the tip of his red tail in his paw   since that time the fox has always had a white tip to his tail    wait a bit reynard  and come here   said the bear   and i ll teach you how to catch horses    yes  reynard was quite willing to learn that  but he didn t trust himself too near the bear    when you see a horse lying asleep in a sunny place   said the bear   you must tie yourself fast with the hair of his tail to your brush  and then fasten your teeth in his thigh   he said   before long the fox found a horse lying asleep on a sunny hillside  and so he did as the bear had told him  he knotted and tied himself well to the horse with the hair of the tail and then fastened his teeth into his thigh   up jumped the horse and began to kick and gallop so that reynard was dashed against stock and stone  and was so bruised and battered that he nearly lost his senses   all at once a hare rushed by    where are you off to in such a hurry  reynard   said the hare    i m having a ride  bunny   said the fox   the hare sat up on his hind legs and laughed till the sides of his mouth split right up to his ears  at the thought of reynard having such a grand ride  but since then the fox has never thought of catching horses again   that time it was bruin who for once had the better of reynard  otherwise they say the bear is as simple minded as the trolls   the lad who went to the north wind  by sir george webbe dasent  once upon a time there was an old widow who had one son  and she was poorly and weak  her son had to go up into the safe to fetch meal for cooking  but when he got outside the safe  and was just going down the steps  there came the north wind  puffing and blowing  caught up the meal  and so away with it through the air   then the lad went back into the safe for more  but when he came out again on the steps  if the north wind didn t come again and carry off the meal with a puff  and more than that  he did so the third time   at this the lad got very angry  and as he thought it hard that the north wind should behave so  he thought he d just look him up and ask him to give up his meal   so off he went  but the way was long  and he walked and walked  but at last he came to the north wind s house    good day   said the lad  and  thank you for coming to see us yesterday     good day   answered the north wind  for his voice was loud and gruff   and thanks for coming to see me   what do you want     oh   answered the lad   i only wished to ask you to be so good as to let me have back that meal you took from me on the safe steps  for we haven t much to live on  and if you re to go on snapping up the morsel we have there ll be nothing for it but to starve     i haven t got your meal   said the north wind   but if you are in such need  i ll give you a cloth which will get you everything you want  if you only say   cloth  spread yourself  and serve up all kinds of good dishes     with this the lad was well content   but  as the way was so long he couldn t get home in one day  he stopped at an inn on the way  and when they were going to sit down to supper  he laid the cloth on a table which stood in the corner and said    cloth  spread yourself  and serve up all kinds of good dishes    he had scarce said so before the cloth did as it was bid  and all who stood by thought it a fine thing  but most of all the landlady   so  when all were fast asleep  at dead of night  she took the lad s cloth  and put another in its stead  just like the one he had got from the north wind  but which couldn t so much as serve up a bit of dry bread   so when the lad awoke  he took his cloth and went off with it  and that day he got home to his mother    now   said he   i ve been to the north wind s house  and a good fellow he is  for he gave me this cloth  and when i only say to it   cloth  spread yourself  and serve up all kinds of good dishes   i get any sort of food i please     all very true  i dare say   said his mother   but seeing is believing  and i shan t believe it till i see it    so the lad made haste  drew out a table  laid the cloth on it  and said   cloth  spread yourself  and serve up all kinds of good dishes    but never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve   well   said the lad   there s no help for it but to go to the north wind again   and away he went   so late in the afternoon he came to where the north wind lived    good evening   said the lad    good evening   said the north wind    i want my rights for that meal of ours which you took   said the lad   for  as for that cloth i got  it isn t worth a penny     i ve got no meal   said the north wind   but yonder you have a ram which coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to it     ram  ram   make money     so the lad thought this a fine thing  but as it was too far to get home that day  he stopped for the night at the same inn where he had slept before   before he called for anything  he tried the truth of what the north wind had said of the ram  and found it all right  but when the landlord saw that  he thought it was a famous ram  and  when the lad had fallen asleep  he took another which couldn t coin gold ducats  and changed the two   next morning off went the lad  and when he got home to his mother  he said  after all  the north wind is a jolly fellow  for now he has given me a ram which can coin golden ducats if i only say   ram  ram   make money      all very true  i dare say   said his mother   but i shan t believe any such stuff until i see the ducats made     ram  ram   make money   said the lad  but the ram made no money   so the lad went back again to the north wind  and blew him up  and said the ram was worth nothing  and he must have his rights for the meal    well   said the north wind   i ve nothing else to give you but that old stick in the corner yonder  but it s a stick of that kind that if you say   stick  stick   lay on   it lays on till you say   stick  stick   now stop    so  as the way was long the lad turned in this night  too  to the landlord  but as he could pretty well guess how things stood as to the cloth and the ram  he lay down at once on the bench and began to snore  as if he were asleep   now the landlord  who easily saw that the stick must be worth something  hunted up one which was like it  and when he heard the lad snore  was going to change the two  but just as the landlord was about to take it  the lad bawled out   stick  stick   lay on    so the stick began to beat the landlord till he jumped over chairs  and tables  and benches  and yelled and roared    oh my   oh my   bid the stick be still  else it will beat me to death  and you shall have back your cloth and your ram   when the lad thought the landlord had got enough  he said   stick  stick   now stop    then he took the cloth and put it into his pocket  and went home with his stick in his hand  leading the ram by a cord round its horns  and so he got his rights for the meal he had lost   the husband who was to mind the house  by sir george webbe dasent  once upon a time there was a man  so surly and cross  he never thought his wife did anything right in the house   so one evening in haymaking time  he came home  scolding and swearing  and showing his teeth and making a dust    dear love  don t be so angry  there s a good man   said his goody   to morrow let s change our work   i ll go out with the mowers and mow  and you shall mind the house at home    yes  the husband thought that would do very well   he was quite willing  he said   so early next morning his goody took a scythe over her neck  and went out into the hayfield with the mowers and began to mow  but the man was to mind the house  and do the work at home   first of all he wanted to churn the butter  but when he had churned a while  he got thirsty  and went down to the cellar to tap a barrel of ale   so  just when he had knocked in the bung  and was putting the tap into the cask  he heard overhead the pig come into the kitchen   then off he ran up the cellar steps  with the tap in his hand  as fast as he could  to look after the pig  lest it should upset the churn  but when he got up  and saw that the pig had already knocked the churn over  and stood there  routing and grunting amid the cream which was running all over the floor  he got so wild with rage that he quite forgot his ale barrel and ran at the pig as hard as he could   he caught it  too  just as it ran out of doors  and gave it such a kick that piggy lay for dead on the spot   then all at once he remembered he had the tap in his hand  but when he got down to the cellar  every drop of ale had run out of the cask   then he went into the dairy and found enough cream left to fill the churn again  and so he began to churn  for butter they must have for dinner   when he had churned a bit  he remembered that their milking cow was still shut up in the brye  and hadn t had a bit to eat or a drop to drink all the morning  though the sun was high   then all at once he thought  twas too far to take her down to the meadow  so he d just get her up on the housetop for the house  you must know  was thatched with sods  and a fine crop of grass was growing there   now their house lay close up against a steep down  and he thought if he laid a plank across to the thatch at the back he d easily get the cow up   but still he couldn t leave the churn  for there was his little babe crawling about the floor  and  if i leave it   he thought   the child is sure to upset it    so he took the churn on his back  and went out with it  but then he thought he d better first water the cow before he turned her out on the thatch  so he took up a bucket to draw water out of the well  but  as he stooped down at the well s brink  all the cream ran out of the churn over his shoulders  and so down into the well   now it was near dinner time  and he hadn t even got the butter yet  so he thought he d best boil the porridge  and filled the pot with water  and hung it over the fire   when he had done that  he thought the cow might perhaps fall off the thatch and break her legs or her neck   so he got up on the house to tie her up   one end of the rope he made fast to the cow s neck  and the other he slipped down the chimney and tied round his own thigh  and he had to make haste  for the water now began to boil in the pot  and he had still to grind the oatmeal   so he began to grind away  but while he was hard at it  down fell the cow off the housetop after all  and as she fell  she dragged the man up the chimney by the rope   there he stuck fast  and as for the cow  she hung halfway down the wall  swinging between heaven and earth  for she could neither get down nor up   and now the goody had waited seven lengths and seven breadths for her husband to come and call them home to dinner  but never a call they had   at last she thought she d waited long enough  and went home   but when she got there and saw the cow hanging in such an ugly place  she ran up and cut the rope in two with her scythe   but as she did this  down came her husband out of the chimney  and so when his old dame came inside the kitchen  there she found him standing on his head in the porridge pot   how one went out to woo  by sir george webbe dasent  o nce upon a time there was a lad who went out to woo him a wife  among other places he came to a farmhouse  where the household were little better than beggars  but when the wooer came in they wanted to make out that they were well to do  as you may guess   now the husband had got a new arm to his coat    pray  take a seat   he said to the wooer   but there s a shocking dust in the house    so he went about rubbing and wiping all the benches and tables with his new arm  but he kept the other all the while behind his back   the wife she had got one new shoe  and she went stamping and sliding with it up against the stools and chairs saying   how untidy it is here   everything is out of place    then they called out to their daughter to come down and put things to rights  but the daughter she had got a new cap  so she put her head in at the door  and kept nodding and nodding  first to this side and then to that    well   for my part  she said  i can t be everywhere at once    aye   aye  that was a well to do household the wooer had come to   why the bear is stumpy tailed  by sir george webbe dasent  one day the bear met the fox  who came slinking along with a string of fish he had stolen    whence did you get these from   asked the bear    oh  my lord bruin  i ve been out fishing and caught them   said the fox   so the bear had a mind to learn to fish too  and bade the fox tell him how he was to set about it    oh  it s an easy craft for you   answered the fox   and soon learned  you ve only got to go upon the ice  and cut a hole and stick your tail down into it  and so you must go on holding it there as long as you can   you re not to mind if your tail smarts a little  that s when the fish bite   the longer you hold it there the more fish you ll get  and then all at once out with it  with a cross pull sideways  and with a strong pull too    yes  the bear did as the fox had said  and held his tail a long  long the down in the hole  till it was fast frozen in   then he pulled it out with a cross pull  and it snapped short off   that s why bruin goes about with a stumpy tail this very day   boots who made the princess say  that s a story   by sir george webbe dasent  once upon a time there was a king who had a daughter  and she was such a dreadful storyteller that the like of her was not to be found far or near   so the king gave out  that if anyone could tell such a string of lies as would get her to say   that s a story   he should have her to wife  and half the kingdom besides   well  many came  as you may fancy  to try their luck  for everyone would have been very glad to have the princess  to say nothing of the kingdom  but they all cut a sorry figure  for the princess was so given to storytelling  that all their lies went in at one ear and out of the other   among the rest came three brothers to try their luck  and the two elder went first  but they fared no better than those that had gone before them   last of all  the third  boots  set off and found the princess in the farmyard    good morning   he said   and thank you for nothing     good morning   said she   and the same to you    then she went on    you haven t such a fine farmyard as ours  i ll be bound  for when two shepherds stand  one at each end of it  and blow their ram s horns  the one can t hear the other     haven t we though   answered boots   ours is far bigger  for when a calf starts to cross a field  it is a full grown cow when it reaches the other end     i dare say   said the princess    well  but you haven t such a big ox  after all  as ours yonder  for when two men sit  one on each horn  they can t touch each other with a tweny foot rule     stuff   said boots   is that all   why  we have an ox who is so big  that when two men sit  one on each horn  and each blows his great mountain trumpet  they can t hear one another     i dare say   said the princess   but you haven t so much milk as we  i ll be bound  for we milk our cows into great pails  and carry them indoors  and empty them into great tubs  and so we make great  great cheeses     oh   you do  do you   said boots    well  we milk ours into great tubs  and then we put them in carts and drive them indoors  and then we turn them out into great brewing vats  and so we make cheeses as big as a great house   we had  too  a dun mare to tread the cheese well together when it was making  but once she tumbled down into the cheese  and we lost her  and after we had eaten at this cheese seven years  we came upon a great dun mare  alive and kicking   well  once after that i was going to drive this mare to the mill  and her backbone snapped in two  but i wasn t put out  not i  for i took a spruce sapling  and put it into her for a backbone  and she had no other backbone all the while we had her   but the sapling grew up into such a tall tree  that i climbed right up to the sky by it  and when i got there i saw a lady sitting and spinning the foam of the sea into pigs  bristle ropes  but just then the spruce fir broke short off  and i couldn t get down again  so the lady let me down by one of the ropes  and down i slipped straight into a fox s hole  and who should sit there but my mother and your father cobbling shoes  and just as i stepped in  my mother gave your father such a box on the ear that it made his whiskers curl     that s a story   said the princess   my father never did any such thing in all his born days    so boots got the princess to wife  and half the kingdom besides    the witch in the stone boat  retold by andrew lang  there was once a king and queen  and they had a son called sigurd  who was very strong and active and good looking   when the king came to be bowed down with the weight of years he spoke to his son  and said that now it was time for him to look out for a fitting match for himself  for he did not know how long he might last now  and he would like to see him married before he died   sigurd was not averse to this and asked his father where he thought it best to look for a wife   the king answered that in a certain country there was a king who had a beautiful daughter  and he thought it would be most desirable if sigurd could get her   so the two parted  and sigurd prepared for the journey and went to where his father had directed him   he came to the king and asked his daughters hand  which was readily granted him  but only on the condition that he should remain there as long as he could  for the king himself was not strong and not very able to govern his kingdom   sigurd accepted this condition  but added that he would have to get leave to go home again to his own country when he heard news of his father s death   after that sigurd married the princess and helped his father in law to govern the kingdom   he and the princess loved each other dearly  and after a year a son came to them  who was two years old when word came to sigurd that his father was dead   sigurd now prepared to return home with his wife and child and went on board ship to go by sea   they had sailed for several days  when the breeze suddenly fell and there came a dead calm at a time when they needed only one day s voyage to reach home   sigurd and his queen were one day on deck when most of the others on the ship had fallen asleep   there they sat and talked for a while  and had their little son along with them   after a time sigurd became so heavy with sleep that he could no longer keep awake  so he went below and lay down  leaving the queen alone on the deck playing with her son   a good while after sigurd had gone below the queen saw something black on the sea which seemed to be coming nearer   as it approached she could make out that it was a boat and could see the figure of some one sitting in it and rowing it   at last the boat came alongside the ship  and now the queen saw that it was a stone boat  out of which there came on board the ship a fearfully ugly witch   the queen was more frightened than words can describe  and could neither speak a word nor move from the place so as to awaken the king or the sailors   the witch came right up to the queen  took the child from her  and laid it on the deck  then she took the queen and stripped her of all her fine clothes  which she proceeded to put on herself and looked then like a human being   last of all she took the queen  put her into the boat and said    this spell i lay upon you  that you slacken not your course until you come to my brother in the under world    the queen sat stunned and motionless  but the boat at once shot away from the ship with her  and before long she was out of sight   when the boat could no longer be seen the child began to cry  and though the witch tried to quiet it she could not manage it  so  with the child on her arm  she went below to where the king was sleeping  and awakened him  scolding him for leaving them alone on deck while he and all the crew were asleep   it was great carelessness of him  she said  to leave no one to watch the ship with her   sigurd was greatly surprised to hear his queen scold him so much  for she had never said an angry word to him before  but he thought it was quite excusable in this case  and tried to quiet the child along with her but it was no use   then he went and wakened the sailors and bade them hoist the sails  for a breeze had sprung up and was blowing straight toward the harbor   they soon reached the land which sigurd was to rule over  and found all the people sorrowful for the old king s death  but they became glad when they got sigurd back to the court  and made him king over them   the king s son  however  hardly ever stopped crying from the time he had been taken from his mother on the deck of the ship  although he had always been such a good child before  so that at last the king had to get a nurse for him one of the maids of the court   as soon as the child got into her charge he stopped crying and behaved as well as before   after the sea voyage it seemed to the king that the queen had altered very much in many ways  and not for the better   he thought her much more haughty and stubborn and difficult to deal with than she used to be   before long others began to notice this as well as the king   in the court there were two young fellows  one of eighteen years old  the other of nineteen  who were very fond of playing chess and often sat long inside playing at it   their room was next the queen s  and often during the day they heard the queen talking   one day they paid more attention than usual when they heard her talk  and put their ears close to a crack in the wall between the rooms  and heard the queen say quite plainly   when i yawn a little  then i am a nice little maiden  when i yawn halfway  then i am half a troll  and when i yawn fully then i am a troll altogether    as she said this she yawned tremendously  and in a moment had put on the appearance of a fearfully ugly troll   then there came up through the floor of the room a three headed giant with a trough full of meat  who saluted her as his sister and set down the trough before her   she began to eat out of it and never stopped till she had finished it   the young fellows saw all this going on  but did not hear the two of them say anything to each other   they were astonished  though  at how greedily the queen devoured the meat and how much she ate of it  and were no longer surprised that she took so little when she sat at table with the king   as soon as she had finished it the giant disappeared with the trough by the same way as he had come  and the queen returned to her human shape   now we must go back to the king s son after he had been put in charge of the nurse   one evening  after she had lit a candle and was holding the child  several planks sprang up in the floor of the room  and out at the opening came a beautiful woman dressed in white  with an iron belt round her waist  to which was fastened an iron chain that went down into the ground   the woman came up to the nurse  took the child from her  and pressed it to her breast  then she gave it back to the nurse and returned by the same way as she had come  and the floor closed over her again   although the woman had not spoken a single word to her  the nurse was very much frightened  but told no one about it   next evening the same thing happened again  just as before  but as the woman was going away she said in a sad tone   two are gone and one only is left   and then disappeared as before   the nurse was still more frightened when she heard the woman say this  and thought that perhaps some danger was hanging over the child  though she had no ill opinion of the unknown woman  who  indeed  had behaved toward the child as if it were her own   the most mysterious thing was the woman saying  and only one is left   but the nurse guessed that this must mean that only one day was left  since she had come for two days already   at last the nurse made up her mind to go to the king   she told him the whole story and asked him to be present in person the next day about the time when the woman usually came   the king promised to do so  and came to the nurse s room a little before the time and sat down on a chair with his drawn sword in his hand   soon after the planks in the floor sprang up as before  and the woman came up  dressed in white  with the iron belt and chain   the king saw at once that it was his own queen  and immediately hewed asunder the iron chain that was fastened to the belt   this was followed by such noises and crashings down in the earth that all the king s palace shook  so that no one expected anything else than to see every bit of it shaken to pieces   at last the noises and shaking stopped  and they began to come to themselves again   the king and queen embraced each other  and she told him the whole story how the witch came to the ship when they were all asleep and sent her off in the boat   after she had gone so far that she could not see the ship  she sailed on through darkness until she landed beside a three headed giant   the giant wished her to marry him  but she refused  whereupon he shut her up by herself and told her she would never get free until she consented   after a time she began to plan how to get her freedom  and at last told him that she would consent if he would allow her to visit her son on earth three days on end   this he agreed to  but put on her this iron belt and chain  the other end of which he fastened around his  own waist  and the great noises that were heard when the king cut the chain must have been caused by the giant s falling down the underground passage when the chain gave way so suddenly   the giant s dwelling  indeed  was right under the palace  and the terrible shakings must have been caused by him in his death throes   the king now understood how the queen he had had for some time past had been so ill tempered   he at once had a sack drawn over her head and made her be stoned to death  and after that torn in pieces by untamed horses   the two young fellows also told now what they had heard and seen in the queen s room  for before this they had been afraid to say anything about it  on account of the queen s power   the real queen was now restored to all her dignity and was beloved by all   the nurse was married to a nobleman and the king and queen gave her splendid presents   the snuffibox  by paul s billot  as often happens in this world  there was once a young man who spent all his time in traveling   one day  as he was walking along  he picked up a snuffbox   he opened it  and the snuffbox said to him in the spanish language    what do you want    he was very much frightened  but  luckily  instead of throwing the box away he only shut it tight and put it in his pocket   then he went on  away  away  away  and as he went he said to himself   if it says to me again   what do you want   i shall know better what to say this time    so he took out the snuffbox and opened it  and again it asked   what do you want     my hat full of gold   answered the youth  and immediately it was full   our young man was enchanted   henceforth he should never be in need of anything   so on he traveled  away  away  away  through thick forests  till at last he came to a beautiful castle   in the castle there lived a king   the young man walked round and round the castle  not caring who saw him  till the king noticed him and asked what he was doing there    i was just looking at your castle     you would like to have one like it  wouldn t you    the young man did not reply  but when it grew dark he took out his snuffbox and opened the lid    what do you want     build me a castle with laths of gold and tiles of diamond and the furniture all of silver and gold    he had scarcely finished speaking when there stood in front of him  exactly opposite the king s palace  a castle built precisely as he had ordered   when the king awoke he was struck dumb at the sight of the magnificent house shining in the rays of the sun   the servants could not do their work for stopping to stare at it   then the king dressed himself and went to see the young man   and he told him plainly that he was a very powerful prince  and that he hoped that they might all live together in one house or the other  and that the king would give him his daughter to wife   so it all turned out just as the king wished   the young man married the princess and they lived happily in the palace of gold   but the king s wife was jealous both of the young man and of her own daughter   the princess had told her mother about the snuffbox  which gave them everything they wanted  and the queen bribed a servant to steal the snuffbox   they noticed carefully where it was put away every night  and one evening  when the whole world was asleep  the woman stole it and brought it to her old mistress   oh  how happy the queen was   she opened the lid and the snuffbox said to her   what do you want    and she answered at once   i want you to take me and my husband and my servants and this beautiful house and set us down on the other side of the red sea  but my daughter and her husband are to stay behind    when the young couple woke up they found themselves back in the old castle  without their snuffbox   they hunted for it high and low  but quite vainly   the young man felt that no time was to be lost  and he mounted his horse and filled his pockets with as much gold as he could carry   on he went  away  away  away  but he sought the snuffbox in vain all up and down the neighboring countries  and very soon he came to the end of all his money   but still he went on  as fast as the strength of his horse would let him  begging his way   some one told him that he ought to consult the moon  for the moon traveled far and might be able to tell him something   so he went away  away  away  and ended  somehow or other  by reaching the land of the moon   there he found a little old woman who said to him   what are you doing here   my son eats all living things he sees  and if you are wise you will go away without coming any farther    but the young man told her all his sad tale  and how he possessed a wonderful snuffbox  and how it had been stolen from him  and how he had nothing left now that he was parted from his wife and was in need of everything   and he said that perhaps her son  who traveled so far  might have seen a palace with laths of gold and tiles of diamond and furnished all in silver and gold   as he spoke these last words the moon came in and said he smelled mortal flesh and blood   but his mother told him that it was an unhappy man who had lost everything and had come all this way to consult him  and bade the young man not to be afraid  but to come forward and show himself   so he went boldly up to the moon  and asked if by any accident he had seen a palace with the laths of gold and the tiles of diamond and all the furniture of silver and gold   once this house belonged to him  but now it was stolen   and the moon said no  but that the sun traveled farther than he did  and that the young man had better go and ask him   so the young man departed and went away  away  away  as well as his horse would take him  begging his living as he rode along  and somehow or other at last he got to the land of the sun   there he found a little old woman  who asked him    what are you doing here   go away  have you not heard that my son feeds upon christians    but he said no and that he would not go  for he was so miserable that it was all one to him whether he died or not  that he had lost everything  and especially a splendid palace like none other in the whole world  for it had laths of gold and tiles of diamond and all the furniture was of silver and gold  and that he had sought it far and long  and in all the earth there was no man more unhappy   so the old woman s heart melted and she agreed to hide him   when the sun arrived he declared that he smelled christian flesh and he meant to have it for his dinner   but his mother told him such a pitiful story of the miserable wretch who had lost everything and had come from far to ask his help that at last he promised to see him   so the young man came out from his hiding place and begged the sun to tell him if in the course of his travels he had not seen somewhere a palace that had not its like in the whole world  for its laths were of gold and its tiles of diamond and all the furniture in silver and gold   and the sun said no  but that perhaps the wind had seen it  for he entered everywhere and saw things that no one else ever saw  and if anyone knew where it was it was certainly the wind   then the poor young man again set forth as well as his horse could take him  begging his living as he went  and somehow or other he ended by reaching the home of the wind   he found there a little old woman busily occupied in filling great barrels with water   she asked him what had put it into his head to come there  for her son ate everything he saw  and that he would shortly arrive quite mad  and that the young man had better look out   but he answered that he was so unhappy that he had ceased to mind anything  even being eaten  and then he told her that he had been robbed of a palace that had not its equal in all the world  and of all that was in it  and that he had even left his wife and was wandering over the world until he found it   and that it was the sun who had sent him to consult the wind   so she hid him under the staircase  and soon they heard the south wind arrive  shaking the house to its foundations   thirsty as he was  he did not wait to drink  but he told his mother that he smelled the blood of a christian man  and that she had better bring him out at once and make him ready to be eaten   but she bade her son eat and drink what was before him  and said that the poor young man was much to be pitied  and that the sun had granted him his life in order that he might consult the wind   then she brought out the young man  who explained how he was seeking for his palace  and that no man had been able to tell him where it was  so he had come to the wind   and he added that he had been shamefully robbed  and that the laths were of gold and the tiles of diamond  and all the furniture in silver and gold  and he inquired if the wind had not seen such a palace during his wanderings   and the wind said yes  and that all that day he had been blowing backward and forward over it without being able to move one single tile    oh  do tell me where it is   cried the young man     it is a long way off   replied the wind   on the other side of the red sea   but our traveler was not discouraged he had already journeyed too far   so he set forth at once  and somehow or other he managed to reach that distant land   and he inquired if any one wanted a gardener   he was told that the head gardener at the castle had just left  and perhaps he might have a chance of getting the place   the young man lost no time  but walked up to the castle and asked if they were in want of a gardener  and how happy he was when they agreed to take him   now he passed most of his day in gossiping with the servants about the wealth of their masters and the wonderful things in the house   he made friends with one of the maids  who told him the history of the snuffbox  and he coaxed her to let him see it   one evening she managed to get hold of it  and the young man watched carefully where she hid it away in a secret place in the bedchamber of her mistress   the following night  when everyone was fast asleep  he crept in and took the snuffbox   think of his joy as he opened the lid   when it asked him  as of yore   what do you want    he replied   what do i want   what do i want   why  i want to go with my palace to the old place  and for the king and the queen and all their servants to be drowned in the red sea    he had hardly finished speaking when he found himself back again with his wife  while all the other inhabitants of the palace were lying at the bottom of the red sea   the golden blackbird  by paul s billot  once upon a time there was a great lord who had three sons   he fell very ill  sent for doctors of every kind  even bonesetters  but they none of them could find out what was the matter with him or even give him any relief   at last there came a foreign doctor  who declared that the golden blackbird alone could cure the sick man   so the old lord dispatched his eldest son to look for the wonderful bird  and promised him great riches if he managed to find it and bring it back   the young man began his journey and soon arrived at a place where four roads met   he did not know which to choose  and tossed his cap in the air  determining that the direction of its fall should decide him  after traveling for two or three days he grew tired of walking without knowing where or for how long  and  he stopped at an inn which was filled with merrymakers and ordered something to eat and drink    my faith   said he   it is sheer folly to waste more time hunting for this bird   my father is old  and if he dies i shall inherit his goods    the old man  after waiting patiently for some time  sent his second son to seek the golden blackbird   the youth took the same direction as his brother  and when he came to the crossroads he too tossed up which road he should take   the cap fell in the same place as before  and he walked on till he came to the spot where his brother had halted   the latter  who was leaning out of the window of the inn  called to him to stay where he was and amuse himself    you are right   replied the youth    who knows if i should ever find the golden blackbird  even if i sought the whole world through for it  at the worst  if the old man dies we shall have his property    he entered the inn and the two brothers made merry and feasted  till very soon their money was all spent   they even owed something to their landlord  who kept them as hostages till they could pay their debts   the youngest son set forth in his turn  and he arrived at the place where his brothers where still prisoners   they called to him to stop and did all they could to prevent his going further    no   he replied   my father trusted me  and i will go all over the world till i find the golden blackbird     bah   said his brothers   you will never succeed any better than we did   let him die if he wants to   we will divide the property    as he went his way he met a little hare  who stopped to looked at him and asked    where are you going  my friend      i really don t quite know   answered he    my father is ill  and he cannot be cured unless i bring him back the golden blackbird   it is a long time since i set out  but no one can tell me where to find it     ah   said the hare   you have a long way to go yet   you will have to walk at least seven hundred miles before you get to it     and how am i to travel such a distance     mount on my back   said the little hare   and i will conduct you    the young man obeyed   at each bound the little hare went seven miles  and it was not long before they reached a castle that was as large and beautiful as a castle could be    the golden blackbird is in a little cabin near by   said the little hare   and you will easily find it   it lives in a little cage  with another cage beside it made all of gold   but whatever you do  be sure not to put it in the beautiful cage  or everybody in the castle will know that you have stolen it    the youth found the golden blackbird standing on a wooden perch  but as stiff and rigid as if he was dead   and beside  was the beautiful cage  the cage of gold    perhaps he would revive if i were to put him in that lovely cage   thought the youth   the moment the golden blackbird had touched the bars of the splendid cage he awoke and began to whistle  so that all the servants of the castle ran to see what was the matter  saying that he was a thief and must be put in prison    no   he answered   i am not a thief   if i have taken the golden blackbird  it is only that it may cure my father  who is ill  and i have traveled more than seven hundred miles in order to find it     well   they replied   we will let you go  and will even give you the golden blackbird if you are able to bring us the porcelain maiden    the youth departed  weeping  and met the little hare  who was munching wild thyme    what are you crying for  my friend    asked the hare    it is because   he answered   the castle people will not allow me to carry off the golden blackbird without giving them the porcelain maiden in exchange     you have not followed my advice   said the little hare    and you have put the golden blackbird into the fine cage     alas   yes     don t despair   the porcelain maiden is a young girl  beautiful as venus  who dwells two hundred miles from here   jump on my back and i will take you there    the little hare  who took seven miles in a stride  was there in no time at all  and he stopped on the borders of a lake    the porcelain maiden   said the hare to the youth   will come here to bathe with her friends   keep yourself out of sight behind the thicket  while i just eat a mouthful of thyme to refresh me   when she is in the lake be sure you hide her clothes  which are of dazzling whiteness  and do not give them back to her unless she consents to follow you    the little hare left him  and almost immediately the porcelain maiden arrived with her friends   she undressed herself and got into the water   then the young man glided up noiselessly and laid hold of her clothes  which he hid under a rock at some distance   when the porcelain maiden was tired of playing in the water she came out to dress herself  but though she hunted for her clothes high and low she could find them nowhere   her friends helped her in the search  but  seeing at last that it was of no use  they left her alone on the bank  weeping bitterly    why do you cry    said the young man  approaching her    alas    answered she   while i was bathing some one stole my clothes  and my friends have abandoned me     i will find your clothes if you will only come with me    and the porcelain maiden agreed to follow him  and after having given up her clothes the young man bought a small horse for her which went like the wind   the little hare brought them both back to seek for the golden blackbird  and when they drew near the castle where it lived the little hare said to the young man    now  do be a little sharper than you were before  and you will manage to carry off both the golden blackbird and the porcelain maiden   take the golden cage in one hand and leave the bird in the old cage where he is  and bring that away too    the little hare then vanished   the youth did as he was bid  and the castle servants never noticed that he was carrying off the golden blackbird   when he reached the inn where his brothers were detained he delivered them by paying their debt   they set out all together  but as the two elder brothers were jealous of the success of the youngest  they took the opportunity as they were passing by the shores of a lake to throw themselves upon him  seize the golden blackbird  and fling him in the water   then they continued their journey  taking with them the porcelain maiden  in the firm belief that their brother was drowned  but happily he had snatched in falling at a tuft of rushes and called loudly for help   the little hare came running to him and said   take hold of my leg and pull yourself out of the water    when he was safe on shore the little hare said to him    now  this is what you have to do  dress yourself like a breton seeking a place as stableboy  and go and offer your services to your father  once there  you will easily be able to make him understand the truth    the young man did as the little hare bade him  and he went to his father s castle and inquired if they were not in want of a stableboy    yes   replied his father   very much indeed   but it is not an easy place   there is a little horse in the stable which will not let anyone go near it  and it has already kicked to death several people who have tried to groom it     i will undertake to groom it   said the youth    i never saw the horse i was afraid of yet    the little horse allowed itself to be rubbed down without a toss of its head and without a kick    good gracious    exclaimed the master    how is it that he lets you touch him when no one else can go near him     perhaps he knows me   answered the stableboy   two or three days later the master said to him   the porcelain maiden is here  but though she is as lovely as the dawn  she is so wicked that she scratches every one that approaches her   try if she will accept your services    when the youth entered the room where she was the golden blackbird broke forth into a joyful song  and the porcelain maiden sang too and jumped for joy    good gracious    cried the master    the porcelain maiden and the golden blackbird know you too     yes   replied the youth   and the porcelain maiden can tell you the whole truth if she only will    then she told all that had happened  and how she had consented to follow the young man who had captured the golden blackbird    yes   added the youth   i delivered my brothers  who were kept prisoners in an inn  and as a reward they threw me into a lake   so i disguised myself and came here in order to prove the truth to you   so the old lord embraced his son and promised that he should inherit all his possessions  and he put to death the two elder ones  who had deceived him and had tried to slay their own brother   the young man married the porcelain maiden and had a splendid wedding feast  the half chick  retold by andrew lang  once upon a time there was a handsome black spanish hen who had a large brood of chickens   they were all fine  plump little birds except the youngest  who was quite unlike his brothers and sisters   indeed  he was such a strange  queer looking creature that when he first clipped his shell his mother could scarcely believe her eyes  he was so different from the twelve other fluffy  downy  soft little chicks who nestled under her wings   this one looked just as if he had been cut in two   he had only one leg  and one wing  and one eye  and he had half a head and half a beak   his mother shook her head sadly as she looked at him and said    my youngest born is only a half chick   he can never grow up a tall  handsome cock like his brothers   they will go out into the world and rule over poultry yards of their own  but this poor little fellow will always have to stay at home with his mother    and she called him medio pollito  which is spanish for half chick   now  though medio pollito was such an odd  helpless looking little thing  his mother soon found that he was not at all willing to remain under her wing and protection   indeed  in character he was as unlike his brothers and sisters as he was in appearance   they were good  obedient chickens  and when the old hen chicked after them they chirped and ran back to her side   but medio pollito had a roving spirit in spite of his one leg  and when his mother called to him to return to the coop  he pretended that he could not hear  because he had only one ear   when she took the whole family out for a walk in the fields  medio pollito would hop away by himself and hide among the corn   many an anxious minute his brothers and sisters had looking for him  while his mother ran to and fro cackling in fear and dismay   as he grew older he became more self willed and disobedient  and his manner to his mother was often very rude and his temper to the other chickens very disagreeable   one day he had been out for a longer expedition than usual in the fields   on his return he strutted up to his mother with the peculiar little hop and kick which was his way of walking  and cocking his one eye at her in a very bold way  he said    mother  i am tired of this life in a dull f farmyard  with nothing but a dreary maize field to look at   i m off to madrid to see the king     to madrid  medio pollito   exclaimed his mother    why  you silly chick  it would be a long journey for a grown up cock  and a poor little thing like you would be tired out before you had gone half the distance   no  no  stay at home with your mother  and some day  when you are bigger  we will go a little journey together    but medio pollito had made up his mind  and he would not listen to his mother s advice nor to the prayers and entreaties of his brothers and sisters    what is the use of our all crowding each other up in this poky little place    he said    when i have a fine courtyard of my own at the king s palace  i shall perhaps ask some of you to come and pay me a short visit    and scarcely waiting to say good by to his family  away he stumped down the high road that led to madrid    be sure that you are kind and civil to every one you meet   called his mother  running after him  but he was in such a hurry to be off that he did not wait to answer her or even to look back   a little later in the day  as he was taking a short cut through a field  he passed a stream   now  the stream was all choked up and overgrown with weeds and water plants  so that its waters could not flow freely    oh   medio pollito   it cried as the half chick hopped along its banks   do come and help me by clearing away these weeds     help you  indeed   exclaimed medio pollito  tossing his head and shaking the few feathers in his tail    do you think i have nothing to do but to waste my time on such trifles   help yourself and don t trouble busy travelers   i am off to madrid to see the king   and hoppity kick  hoppity kick  away stumped medio pollito   a little later he came to a fire that had been left by some gypsies in a wood   it was burning very low and would soon be out    oh   medio pollito   cried the fire in a weak  wavering voice as the half chick approached   in a few minutes i shall go quite out unless you put some sticks and dry leaves upon me   do help me or i shall die     help you  indeed    answered medio pollito    i have other things to do   gather sticks for yourself and don t trouble me   i am off to madrid to see the king   and hoppity kick  hoppity kick  away stumped medio pollito   the next morning  as he was getting near madrid  he passed a large chestnut tree  in whose branches the wind was caught and entangled    oh   medio pollito   called the wind   do hop up here and help me to get free of these branches   i cannot come away and it is so uncomfortable     it is your own fault for going there   answered medio pollito    i can t waste all my morning stopping here to help you   just shake yourself off  and don t hinder me  for i am off to madrid to see the king   and hoppity kick  hoppity kick  away stumped medio pollito in great glee  for the towers and roofs of madrid were now in sight   when he entered the town he saw before him a great  splendid house  with soldiers standing before the gates   this he knew must be the king s palace  and he determined to hop up to the front gate and wait there until the king came out   but as he was hopping past one of the back windows the king s cook saw him    here is the very thing i want   he exclaimed   for the king has just sent a message to say that he must have chicken broth for his dinner   opening the window he stretched out his arm  caught medio pollito  and popped him into the broth pot that was standing near the fire   oh  how wet and clammy the water felt as it went over medio pollito s head  making his feathers cling to him    water   water   he cried in his despair   do have pity upon me and do not wet me like this     ah  medio pollito   replied the water   you would not help me when i was a little stream away on the fields   now you must be punished    then the fire began to burn and scald medio pollito  and he danced and hopped from one side of the pot to the other  trying to get away from the heat and crying out in pain    fire   fire   do not scorch me like this  you can t think how it hurts     ah  medio pollito   answered the fire   you would not help me when i was dying away in the wood   you are being punished    at last  just when the pain was so great that medio pollito thought he must die  the cook lifted up the lid of the pot to see if the broth was ready for the king s dinner    look here   he cried in horror   this chicken is quite useless   it is burned to a cinder   i can t send it up to the royal table    and opening the window he threw medio pollito out in the street   but the wind caught him up and whirled him through the air so quickly that medio pollito could scarcely breathe  and his heart beat against his side till he thought it would break    oh  wind i  at last he gasped out   if you hurry me along like this you will kill me   do let me rest a moment  or    but he was so breathless that he could not finish his sentence    ah  medio pollito   replied the wind   when i was caught in the branches of the chestnut tree you would not help me   now you are punished    and he swirled medio pollito over the roofs of the houses till they reached the highest church in the town  and there he left him fastened to the top of the steeple   and there stands medio pollito to this day   and if you go to madrid and walk through the streets till you come to the highest church  you will see medio pollito perched on his one leg on the steeple  with his one wing drooping at his side and gazing sadly out of his one eye over the town   the three brothers  by hermann r  kletke  there was once upon a time a witch who in the shape of a hawk used every night to break the windows of a certain village church   in the same village there lived three brothers  who were all determined to kill the mischievous hawk   but in vain did the two eldest mount guard in the church with their guns  as soon as the bird appeared high above their heads sleep overpowered them  and they only awoke to hear the windows crashing in   then the younger brother took his turn of guarding the windows  and to prevent his being overcome by sleep he placed a lot of thorns under his chin  so that if he felt drowsy and nodded his head they would prick him and keep him awake   the moon was already risen and it was as light as day  when suddenly he heard a fearful noise  and at the same time a terrible desire to sleep overpowered him   his eyelids closed and his head sank on his shoulders  but the thorns ran into him and were so painful that he awoke at once   he saw the hawk swooping down upon the church  and in a moment he had seized his gun and shot at the bird   the hawk fell heavily under a big stone  severely wounded in its right wing   the youth ran to look at it and saw that a huge abyss had opened below the stone   he went at once to fetch his brothers  and with their help dragged a lot of pine wood and ropes to the spot   they fastened some of the burning pine wood to the end of the rope and let it slowly down to the bottom of the abyss   at first it was quite dark  and the flaming torch only lit up dirty gray stone walls   but the youngest brother determined to explore the abyss  and letting himself down by the rope he soon reached the bottom   here he found a lovely meadow full of green trees and exquisite flowers   in the middle of the meadow stood a huge stone castle  with an iron gate leading to it  which was wide open   everything in the castle seemed to be made of copper  and the only inhabitant he could discover was a lovely girl  who was combing her golden hair  and he noticed that whenever one of her hairs fell on the ground it rang out like pure metal   the youth looked at her more closely  and saw that her skin was smooth and fair  her blue eyes bright and sparkling  and her hair as golden as the sun   he fell in love with her on the spot  and kneeling at her feet he implored her to become his wife   the lovely girl accepted his proposal gladly  but at the same time she warned him that she could never come up to the world above till her mother  the old witch  was dead   and she went on to tell him that the only way in which the old creature could be killed was with the sword that hung up in the castle  but the sword was so heavy that no one could lift it   then the youth went into a room in the castle where everything was made of silver  and here he found another beautiful girl  the sister of his bride   she was combing her silver hair  and every hair that fell on the ground rang out like pure metal   the second girl handed him the sword  but though he tried with all his strength he could not lift it  at last a third sister came to him and gave him a drop of something to drink  which she said would give him the needful strength   he drank one drop  but still he could not lift the sword  then he drank a second and the sword began to move  but only after he had drunk a third drop was he able to swing the sword over his head   then he hid himself in the castle and awaited the old witch s arrival  at last as it was beginning to grow dark she appeared   she swooped down upon a big apple tree  and after shaking some golden apples from it she pounced down upon the earth   as soon as her feet touched the ground she became transformed from a hawk into a woman   this was the moment the youth was waiting for  and he swung his mighty sword in the air with all his strength and the witch s head fell off  and her blood spurted upon the walls   without fear of any further danger  he packed up all the treasures of the castle into great chests and gave his brothers a signal to pull them up out of the abyss   first the treasures were attached to the rope and then the three lovely girls   and now everything was up above and only he himself remained below   but as he was a little suspicious of his brothers  he fastened a heavy stone on to the rope and let them pull it up   at first they heaved with a will  but when the stone was halfway up they let it drop suddenly  and it fell to the bottom broken into a hundred pieces    so that s what would have happened to my bones had i trusted myself to them   said the youth sadly  and he cried bitterly  not because of the treasures  but because of the lovely girl with her swanlike neck and golden hair   for a long time he wandered sadly all through the beautiful underworld  and one day he met a magician who asked him the cause of his tears  the youth told him all that had befallen him  and the magician said    do not grieve  young man   if you will guard the children who are hidden in the golden apple tree i will bring you at once up to the earth   another magician who lives in this land always eats my children up   it is in vain that i have hidden them under the earth and locked them into the castle   now i have hidden them in the apple tree  hide yourself there  too  and at midnight you will see my enemy    the youth climbed up the tree and picked some of the beautiful golden apples  which he ate for his supper   at midnight the wind began to rise and a rustling sound was heard at the foot of the tree   the youth looked down and beheld a long thick serpent beginning to crawl up the tree   it wound itself round the stem and gradually got higher and higher   it stretched its huge head  in which the eyes glittered fiercely  among the branches  searching for the nest in which the little children lay   they trembled with terror when they saw the hideous creature and hid themselves beneath the leaves   then the youth swung his mighty sword in the air  and with one blow cut off the serpent s head   he cut up the rest of the body into little bits and strewed them to the four winds   the father of the rescued children was so delighted over the death of his enemy that he told the youth to get on his back  and thus he carried him up to the world above   with what joy did he hurry now to his brothers  house   he burst into a room where they were all assembled  but no one knew who he was   only his bride  who was serving as cook to her sisters  recognized her lover at once   his brothers  who had quite believed he was dead  yielded him up his treasures at once and flew into the woods in terror   but the good youth forgave them all they had done and divided his treasures with them   then he built himself a big castle with golden windows  and there he lived happily with his golden haired wife till the end of their lives   the glass mountain  by hermann r  kletke  once upon a time there was a glass mountain at the top of which stood a castle made of pure gold  and in front of the castle there grew an apple tree on which there were golden apples   anyone who picked an apple gained admittance into the golden castle  and there in a silver room sat an enchanted princess of surpassing fairness and beauty   she was as rich  too  as she was beautiful  for the cellars of the castle were full of precious stones  and great chests of the finest gold stood round the walls of all the rooms   many knights had come from afar to try their luck  but it was in vain they attempted to climb the mountain   in spite of having their horses shod with sharp nails  no one managed to get more than halfway up  and then they all fell back right down to the bottom of the steep  slippery hill   sometimes they broke an arm  sometimes a leg  and many a brave man had broken his neck even   the beautiful princess sat at her window and watched the bold knights trying to reach her on their splendid horses   the sight of her always gave men fresh courage  and they flocked from the four quarters of the globe to attempt the work of rescuing her   but all in vain  and for seven years the princess had sat now and waited for some one to scale the glass mountain   a heap of corpses both of riders and horses lay round the mountain  and many dying men lay groaning there unable to go any further with their wounded limbs   the whole neighborhood had the appearance of a vast churchyard   in three more days the seven years would be at an end  when a knight in golden armor and mounted on a spirited steed was seen making his way toward the fatal hill   sticking his spurs into his horse he made a rush at the mountain and got up halfway  then he calmly turned his horse s head and came down again without a slip or stumble   the following day he started in the same way  the horse trod on the glass as if it had been level earth  and sparks of fire flew from its hoofs   all the other knights gazed in astonishment  for he had almost gained the summit  and in another moment he would have reached the apple tree  but of a sudden a huge eagle rose up and spread its mighty wings  hitting as it did so the knight s horse in the eye   the beast shied  opened its wide nostrils  and tossed its mane  then rearing high up in the air  its hind feet slipped and it fell with its rider down the steep mountain side  nothing was left of either of them except their bones  which rattled in the battered  golden armor like dry peas in a pod   and now there was only one more day before the close of the seven years   then there arrived on the scene a mere school boy a merry  happy hearted youth  but at the same time strong and well grown   he saw how many knights had broken their necks in vain  but undaunted he approached the steep mountain on foot and began the ascent   for long he had heard his parents speak of the beautiful princess who sat in the golden castle at the top of the glass mountain   he listened to all he heard and determined that he too would try his luck   but first he went to the forest and caught a lynx  and cutting off the creature s sharp claws  he fastened them on to his own hands and feet   armed with these weapons he boldly started up the glass mountain   the sun was nearly going down  and the youth had not got more than halfway up   he could hardly draw breath he was so worn out  and his mouth was parched by thirst   a huge black cloud passed over his head  but in vain did he beg and beseech her to let a drop of water fall on him   he opened his mouth  but the black cloud sailed past and not as much as a drop of dew moistened his dry lips   his feet were torn and bleeding  and he could only hold on now with his hands   evening closed in  and he strained his eyes to see if he could behold the top of the mountain   then he gazed beneath him  and what a sight met his eyes   a yawning abyss  with certain and terrible death at the bottom  reeking with half decayed bodies of horses and riders  and this had been the end of all the other brave men who like himself had attempted the ascent   it was almost pitch dark now  and only the stars lit up the glass mountain   the poor boy still clung on as if glued to the glass by his blood stained hands   he made no struggle to get higher  for all his strength had left him  and seeing no hope he calmly awaited death  then all of a sudden he fell into a deep sleep  and forgetful of his dangerous position he slumbered sweetly   but all the same  although he slept  he had stuck his sharp claws so firmly into the glass that he was quite safe not to fall   now  the golden apple tree was guarded by the eagle which had overthrown the golden knight and his horse   every night it flew round the glass mountain keeping a careful lookout  and no sooner had the moon emerged from the clouds than the bird rose up from the apple tree  and circling round in the air caught sight of the sleeping youth   greedy for carrion  and sure that this must be a fresh corpse  the bird swooped down upon the boy   but he was awake now  and perceiving the eagle  he determined by its help to save himself   the eagle dug its sharp claws into the tender flesh of the youth  but he bore the pain without a sound and seized the bird s two feet with his hands   the creature in terror lifted him high up into the air and began to circle round the tower of the castle   the youth held on bravely   he saw the glittering palace  which by the pale rays of the moon looked like a dim lamp  and he saw the high windows  and round one of them a balcony in which the beautiful princess sat lost in sad thoughts   then the boy saw that he was close to the apple tree  and drawing a small knife from his belt he cut off both the eagle s feet  the bird rose up in the air in its agony and vanished into the clouds  and the youth fell on to the broad branches of the apple tree   then he drew out the claws of the eagle s feet that had remained in his flesh and put the peel of one of the golden apples on the wound  and in one moment it was healed and well again   he pulled several of the beautiful apples and put them in his pocket  then he entered the castle   the door was guarded by a great dragon  but as soon as he threw an apple at it the beast vanished   at the same moment a gate opened  and the youth perceived a courtyard full of flowers and beautiful trees  and on a balcony sat the lovely enchanted princess with her retinue   as soon as she saw the youth she ran toward him and greeted him as her husband and master   she gave him all her treasures  and the youth became a rich and mighty ruler   but he never returned to the earth  for only the mighty eagle  who had been the guardian of the princess and of the castle  could have carried on his wings the enormous treasure down to the world   but as the eagle had lost its feet  it died  and its body was found in a wood on the glass mountain   one day when the youth was strolling about the palace garden with the princess  his wife  he looked down over the edge of the glass mountain and saw to his astonishment a great number of people gathered there  he blew his silver whistle  and the swallow who acted as messenger in the golden castle flew past    fly down and ask what the matter is   he said to the little bird  who sped off like lightning and soon returned saying    the blood of the eagle has restored all the people below to life   all those who have perished on this mountain are awakening up to day  as it were from a sleep  and are mounting their horses  and the whole population are gazing on this unheard of wonder with joy and amazement    huntsman the unlucky  by john t  naak   once upon a time there lived a huntsman   he would go every day in search of game  but it often happened that he killed nothing  and so was obliged to return home with his bag empty   on that account he was nicknamed  huntsman the unlucky    at last he was reduced by his ill fortune to such extremities that he had not a piece of bread nor a kopek left   the wretched man wandered about the forest  cold and hungry  he had eaten nothing for three days  and was nearly dying of starvation   he lay down on the grass determined to put an end to his existence  happily better thoughts came into his mind  he crossed himself  and threw away the gun   suddenly he heard a rustling noise near him   it seemed to issue from some thick grass close at hand   the hunter got up and approached the spot   he then observed that the grass partly hid a gloomy abyss  from the bottom of which there rose a stone  and on it lay a small jar   as he looked and listened the hunter heard a small voice crying    dear  kind traveler  release me    the voice seemed to proceed from the little jar   the courageous hunter  walking carefully from one stone to another  approached the spot where the jar lay  took it up gently  and heard a voice crying from within like the chirping of a grasshopper    release me  and i will be of service to you     who are you  my little friend   asked huntsman the unlucky    i have no name  and cannot be seen by human eyes   answered a soft voice    if you want me  call  murza    a wicked magician put me in this jar  sealed it with the seal of king solomon  and then threw me into this fearful place  where i have lain for seventy years     very good   said huntsman the unlucky   i will give you your liberty  and then we shall see how you will keep your word    he broke the seal and opened the little jar there was nothing in it    halloa   where are you  my friend   cried the hunter    by your side   a voice answered   the hunter looked about him  but could see no one    murza     ready   i await your orders   i am your servant for the next three days  and will do whatever you desire   you have only to say   go there  i know not where  bring something  i know not what      very well   said the hunter     you will doubtless know best what is wanted  go there  i know not where  bring something  i know not what    as soon as the hunter had uttered these words there appeared before him a table covered with dishes  each filled with the most delicious viands  as if they had come direct from a banquet of the czar   the hunter sat down at the table  and ate and drank till he was satisfied  he then rose  crossed himself  and  bowing on all sides  exclaimed    thank you   thank you    instantly the table  and everything else with it  disappeared  and the hunter continued his journey   after walking some distance he sat down by the roadside to rest   it so happened that while the hunter was resting himself  there passed through the forest a gypsy thief  leading a horse which he wanted to sell    i wish i had the money to buy the horse with   thought the hunter   what a pity my pockets are empty   however  i will ask my invisible friend   murza     ready     go there  i know not where  bring something  i know not what    in less than a minute the hunter heard the money chinking in his pocket  gold poured into them  he knew not how nor whence    thanks   you have kept your word   said the hunter   he then began to bargain with the gypsy for the horse   having agreed upon the price  he paid the man in gold  who  staring at the hunter with his mouth wide open  wondered where huntsman the unlucky had got so much money from   parting from the hunter  the gypsy thief ran with all his speed to the farther end of the forest  and whistled   there was no answer    they are asleep   thought the gypsy  and entered a cavern where some robbers  lying on the skins of animals  were resting themselves    halloa  comrades   are you asleep   cried the gypsy    get up  quick  or you will lose a fine bird   he is alone in the forest  and his pockets are full of gold   make haste    the robbers sprang up  mounted their horses  and galloped after the hunter   the hunter heard the clatter  and seeing himself suddenly surrounded by robbers  cried out   murza     ready    answered a voice near him    go there  i know not where  bring something  i know not what    there was a rustling noise heard in the forest  and then something from behind the trees fell upon the robbers   they were knocked from their horses  and scattered on all sides  yet no hand was seen to touch them  the robbers  thrown upon the ground  could not raise themselves  and the hunter  thankful and rejoicing at his deliverance  rode on  and soon found his way out of the dark forest  and came upon a town   near this town there were pitched tents full of soldiers   huntsman the unlucky was told that an enormous army of tartars had come  under the command of their khan  who  angry at being refused the hand of the beautiful princess milovzora  the daughter of the czar  had declared war against him   the hunter had seen the princess milovzora when she was out hunting in the forest   she used to ride a beautiful horse  and carry a golden lance in her hand  a magnificent quiver of arrows hung from her shoulder   when her veil was lifted up she appeared like the spring sunlight  to give light to the eyes and warmth to the heart   the hunter reflected for a little while  and then cried   murza    in an instant he found himself dressed in splendid attire  his jacket was embroidered with gold  he wore a beautiful mantle on his shoulders  and ostrich feathers hung gracefully down from the top of his helmet  fastened by a brooch of a ruby surrounded by pearls   the hunter went into the castle  presented himself before the czar  and offered to drive away the forces of the enemy on condition that the czar gave him the beautiful princess milovzora for his wife   the czar was greatly surprised  but did not like to refuse such an offer at once  he first asked the hunter his name  his birth and his possessions    i am called huntsman the unlucky  master of murza the invisible    the czar thought the young stranger was mad  the courtiers  however  who had seen him before  assured the czar that the stranger exactly resembled huntsman the unlucky  whom they knew  but how he had got that splendid dress they could not tell   then the czar demanded    do you hear what they say   if you are telling lies  you will lose your head   let us see  then  how you will overcome the enemy with the forces of your invisible murza     be of good hope  czar   answered the hunter   as soon as i say the word  everything will be completed     good   said the czar    if you have spoken the truth you shall have my daughter for your wife  if not  your head will be the forfeit    the hunter said to himself   i shall either become a prince  or i am a lost man    he then whispered   murza  go there  i know not where  do this  i know not what    a few minutes passed  and there was nothing to be heard or seen  huntsman the unlucky turned pale  the czar  enraged  ordered him to be seized and put in irons  when suddenly the firing of guns was heard in the distance   the czar and his courtiers ran out on the steps leading to the castle  and saw bodies of men approaching from both right and left  their standards waving gracefully in the air  the soldiers were splendidly equipped   the czar could hardly believe his eyes  for he himself had no troops so fine as these    this is no delusion   cried huntsman the unlucky    these are the forces of my invisible friend     let them drive away the enemy then  if they can   said the czar   the hunter waved his handkerchief   the army wheeled into position  music burst forth in a martial strain  and then a great cloud of dust arose   when the dust had cleared away  the army was gone   the czar invited huntsman the unlucky to dinner  and asked him numerous questions about murza the invisible   at the second course the news came that the enemy was flying in every direction  completely routed  the terrified tartars had left all their tents and baggage behind them  the czar thanked the hunter for his assistance  and informed his daughter that he had found a husband for her   princess milovzora blushed upon receiving this intelligence  then turned pale  and began to shed tears   the hunter whispered something to murza  and the princess s tears changed into precious stones as they fell   the courtiers hastened to pick them up they were pearls and diamonds   the princess smiled at this  and overcome with pleasure gave her hand to huntsman the unlucky unlucky no longer   then began the feast   but here the story must end   story of little simpleton  by john t  naak   once there lived a peasant and his wife who had three daughters   the two elder girls were cunning and selfish  the youngest was simple and open hearted  and on that account came to be called  first by her sisters and afterward by her father and mother   little simpleton   little simpleton was pushed about  had to fetch everything that was wanted  and was always kept at work  but she was ever ready to do what she was told  and never uttered a word of complaint   she would water the garden  prepare pine splinters  milk the cows  and feed the ducks  she had to wait upon everybody in a word  she was the drudge of the family   one day  as the peasant was going with the hay to market  he asked his daughters what they would like him to buy for them    buy me some kumach  red wool stuff from bucharest  for a sarafan  a long dress worn by the russian peasant women  father   answered the eldest daughter    and me some nankeen   said the second   the youngest daughter alone did not ask for a present   the peasant was moved with compassion for the girl  although a simpleton she was still his daughter   turning to her he asked  well  little simpleton  what shall i buy for you    little simpleton smiled and replied    buy me  dearest father  a little silver plate and a little apple     what do you want them for   asked her sisters    i will make the little apple roll round the plate  and will say some words to it which an old woman taught me because i gave her a cake    the peasant promised to buy his daughters what they asked of him  and then started for market   he sold his hay  and bought the presents  some nankeen for one of his daughters  for another some kumach  and for little simpleton a little silver plate and a little apple   then he returned home and gave these things to his daughters   the girls were delighted  the two elder ones made themselves sarafans  and laughed at little simpleton  wondering what she would do with the silver plate and the apple   little simpleton did not eat the apple  but sat down in a corner and cried    roll  roll  little apple on the silver plate  and show me towns and fields  forests and seas  lofty mountains and beautiful skies    and the apple began to roll on the plate  and there appeared on it town after town  ships sailing on the seas  and people in the fields  mountains and beautiful skies  suns and stars   all these things looked so beautiful  and were so wonderful  that it would be impossible to tell of them in a story  or describe them with the pen   at first the elder sisters looked at the little plate with delight  soon  however  their hearts were filled with envy  and they began to try to get it from their younger sister   but the girl would not part with it on any account   then the wicked girls said   dearest sister  let us go into the forest to gather blackberries    little simpleton got up  gave the plate and apple to her father  and went with them into the forest   they walked about and gathered blackberries   all at once they saw a spade lying upon the ground   the wicked sisters killed little simpleton with it  and buried her under a birch tree   they returned home late  and told their father   the simpleton is lost  she ran away from us in the forest  we searched  but could not find her anywhere   the wolves must have eaten her    the peasant regretted the loss of his daughter bitterly  for although so simple she was still his child   the wicked sisters also shed tears  her father put the little silver plate and the little apple into a box  and locked them up   next morning a shepherd was tending his sheep near the place  playing on his pipe  and searching in the forest for one of his flock that was missing   he observed the little grave under the birch tree  it was covered by the most lovely flowers  and out of the middle of the grave there grew a reed   the shepherd cut off the reed  and made a pipe of it   as soon as the pipe was prepared  oh  wonderful   it began to play of itself  and say    play  oh pipe  play   and comfort my poor parents and sisters   i was killed for the sake of my little silver plate and my little apple    when the people heard of this they ran out of their huts  and all came round the shepherd and began to ask him who was killed    good people   answered the shepherd   i don t know who it is   while searching for one of my sheep in the forest  i came upon a grave covered with flowers   above them all stood a reed   i cut off the reed and made this pipe of it   it plays of itself  and you have heard what it says    the father of little simpleton happened to be present   he took the pipe into his own hand  and it began to play    play  oh pipe  play   comfort my poor father and mother   i was killed for the sake of my little silver plate and my little apple    the peasant asked the shepherd to take him to the place where he had cut the reed   they all went into the forest  saw the grave  and were astonished at the sight of the lovely flowers which grew there   they opened the grave  and there discovered the body of a girl  which the poor man recognized as that of his youngest daughter   there she lay  murdered but by whom no one could tell   the people asked one another who it was that had killed the poor girl   suddenly the pipe began to play    oh  my dearest father  my sisters brought me to this forest  and here killed me for the sake of my little plate and my little apple   you will not bring me to life until you fetch some of the water from the czar s well    then the wicked sisters confessed it all   they were seized and cast into a dark prison  to await the pleasure of the czar   the peasant set out for the capital   as soon as he arrived at the city  he went to the palace  saw the czar  told his story  and begged permission to take some water from the well   the czar said   you may take some water of life from my well  and as soon as you have restored your daughter to life  bring her here with her little plate and the little apple  bring your other two daughters also    the peasant bowed to the ground  and returned home with a bottle full of the water of life   he hastened to the grave in the forest  lifted up the body of his daughter  and as soon as he had sprinkled it with the water the girl came to life again  and threw herself into his arms  all who were present were moved to tears   then the peasant started again for the capital  and arriving there went at once to the czar s palace   the czar came out  and saw the peasant with his three daughters  two of them with their arms bound  the third  as beautiful as the spring flowers  stood near  the tears like diamonds falling down her cheeks   the czar was very angry with the two wicked sisters  then he asked the youngest for her little plate and apple  the girl took the box from her father s hands  and said    sire  what would you like to see   your towns or your armies  the ships at sea  or the beautiful stars in the sky    then she made the little apple roll round the plate  and there appeared on it many towns  one after the other  with bodies of soldiers near them  with their standards and artillery   then the soldiers made ready for the fight  and the officers stood in their places   the firing commenced  the smoke arose  and hid it all from view   the little apple began again to roll on the plate  and there appeared the sea covered with ships  their flags streaming in the wind   the guns began to fire  the smoke arose  and again all disappeared from their sight   the apple again began to roll on the plate  and there appeared on it the beautiful sky with suns and stars   the czar was astonished   the girl fell down on her knees before him  and cried    oh  sire  take my little plate and my little apple  and forgive my sisters    the czar was moved by her tears and entreaties and forgave the wicked sisters  the delighted girl sprang up and began to embrace and kiss them   the czar smiled  took her by the hand and said   i honor the goodness of your heart  and admire your beauty   would you like to become my wife     sire   answered the beautiful girl   i obey your royal command  but allow me first to ask my parents  permission    the delighted peasant at once gave his consent  they sent for the mother  and she  too  gladly bestowed her blessing    one favor more   said the beautiful girl to the czar    permit my parents and sisters to remain with me    on hearing this the sisters fell down on their knees before her  and cried    we are not worthy of so much favor     dearest sisters   said the beautiful girl   all is forgotten and forgiven   they who remember the past with malice deserve to lose their sight    she then tried to lift them up from the ground  but they  shedding bitter tears  would not rise   then the czar  looking at them with a frown  bade them get up  he allowed them  however  to stay in the palace   a magnificent entertainment then began  the palace was splendidly lighted up  and looked like the sun among the clouds   the czar and czarina rode out in an open chariot and showed themselves to the people  who cried joyfully    long live czar and czarina   may they shine upon us like the glorious sun for years and years to come    the golden fish  by l  m  gask  upon a certain island in the middle of the sea dwelt an old man and his wife   they were so poor that they often went short of bread  for the fish he caught were their only means of livelihood   one day when the man had been fishing for many hours without success  he hooked a small gold fish  whose eyes were bright as diamonds    let me go  kind man   the little creature cried    i should not make a mouthful either for yourself or your wife  and my own mate waits for me down in the waters    the old man was so moved by his pleadings that he took him off the hook and threw him back into the sea   before he swam off to rejoin his mate  the gold fish promised that in return for his kindness he would come to the fisherman s help if ever he wanted him   laughing merrily at this  for he did not believe that a fish could help him except by providing him with food  the old man went home and told his wife    what   she cried   you actually let him go when you had caught him  it was just like your stupidity   we have not a scrap of bread in the house  and now  i suppose  we must starve    her reproaches continued for so long that though he scarcely believed what the fish had said  the poor old man thought that at least it would do no harm to put him to the test   he therefore hastened back to the shore  and stood at the very edge of the waves    golden fish  golden fish   he called    come to me  i pray  with your tail in the water  and your head lifted up toward me    as the last word was uttered the gold fish popped up his head    you see i have kept my promise   he said    what can i do for you  my good friend     there is not a scrap of bread in the house   quavered the old man   and my wife is very angry with me for letting you go    don t trouble about that   said the gold fish in an off hand manner   you will find bread  and to spare  when you go home    and the old man hurried away to see if his little friend had spoken truly   surely enough  he found that the pan was full of fine white loaves    i did not do so badly for you after all  good wife    he said  as they ate their supper  but his wife was anything but satisfied   the more she had  the more she wanted  and she lay awake planning what they should demand from the gold fish next    wake up  you lazy man   she cried to her husband  early next morning   go down to the sea and tell your fish that i must have a new washtub    the old man did as his wife bade him  and the moment he called the gold fish reappeared   he seemed quite willing to grant the new request  and on his return home the old man found a beautiful new washtub in the small yard at the back of their cabin    why didn t you ask for a new cabin too    his wife said angrily    if you had had a grain of sense you would have done this without being told   go back at once  and say that we must have one   the old man was rather ashamed to trouble his friend again so soon  but the gold fish was as obliging as ever    very well   he said   a new cabin you shall have    and the old mart found one so spick and span that he hardly dare cross the floor for fear of soiling it   it would have pleased him greatly had his wife been contented  but she  good woman  did nothing but grumble still    tell your gold fish   she said next day   that i want to be a duchess  with many servants at my beck and call  and a splendid carriage to drive in   once more her wish was granted  but now her husband s plight was hard indeed   she would not let him share her palace  but ordered him off to the stables  where he was forced to keep company with her grooms   in a few days  however  he grew reconciled to his lot  for here he could live in peace  while he learned that she was leading those around her a terrible life  it was not long before she sent for him again    summon the gold fish   she commanded haughtily   and tell him i wish to be queen of the waters  and to rule over all the fish    the poor old man felt sorry for the fish if they had to be under her rule  for prosperity had quite spoiled her   however  he dared not disobey  and once more summoned his powerful friend    make your wife the queen of the waters   exclaimed the gold fish   that is the last thing i should do   she is unfit to reign  for she cannot rule herself or her desires   i shall make her once more a poor old woman   adieu   you will see me no more    the old man returned sorrowfully with this unpleasant message  to find the palace transformed into a humble cabin  and his wife in a skirt of threadbare stuff in place of the rich brocade which she had worn of late   she was sad and humble  and much more easy to live with than she had been before   her husband therefore had occasion many times to think gratefully of the gold fish  and sometimes when drawing up his net the glint of the sun upon the scales of his captives would give him a moment s hope which  alas   was as often disappointed that once again he was to see his benefactor   the wonderful hair  by w  s  karajich  there once lived a man who was very poor  and who had many children  so many that he was unable to support them   as he could not endure the idea of their perishing of hunger  he was often tempted to destroy them  his wife alone prevented him   one night  as he lay asleep  there appeared to him a lovely child in a vision   the child said    oh  man   i see your soul is in danger  in the thought of killing your helpless children   but i know you are poor  and am come here to help you   you will find under your pillow in the morning a looking glass  a red handkerchief  and an embroidered scarf   take these three things  but show them to no one  and go to the forest   in that forest you will find a rivulet   walk by the side of this rivulet until you come to its source  there you will see a girl  as bright as the sun  with long hair streaming down her shoulders   take care that she does you no harm  say not a word to her  for if you utter a single syllable  she will change you into a fish or some other creature  and eat you   should she ask you to comb her hair  obey her   as you comb it  you will find one hair as red as blood  pull it out  and run away with it   be swift  for she will follow you   then throw on the ground  first the embroidered scarf  then the red handkerchief  and last of all the looking glass  they will delay her pursuit of you   sell the hair to some rich man  but see that you do not allow yourself to be cheated  for it is of boundless worth   its produce will make you rich and thus you will be able to feed your children    next morning  when the poor man awoke  he found under his pillow exactly the things the child mad told him of in his dream   he went immediately into the forest  and when he had discovered the rivulet he walked by the side of it  on and on  until he reached its source  there he saw a girl sitting on the bank  threading a needle with the rays of the sun   she was embroidering a net made of the hair of heroes  spread on a frame before her   he approached and bowed to her  the girl got up and demanded    where did you come from  strange knight    the man remained silent   again she asked him    who are you  and why do you come here    and many other questions  but he remained silent as a stone  indicating with his hands only that he was dumb and in need of help   she told him to sit at her feet  and when he had gladly done so  she inclined her head toward him  that he might comb her hair   he began to arrange her hair as if to comb it  but as soon as he had found the red one  he separated it from the rest  plucked it out  leaped up  and ran from her with his utmost speed   the girl sprang after him  and was soon at his heels   the man  turning round as he ran  and seeing that his pursuer would soon overtake him  threw the embroidered scarf on the ground  as he had been told   when the girl saw it  she stopped and began to examine it  turning it over on both sides  and admiring the embroidery   meanwhile the man gained a considerable distance in advance   the girl tied the scarf round her bosom and recommenced the pursuit   when the man saw that she was again about to overtake him  he threw down the red handkerchief   at the sight of it  the girl again stopped  examined  and wondered at it  the peasant  in the meantime  was again enabled to increase the distance between them   when the girl perceived this  she became furious  and throwing away both scarf and handkerchief began to run with increased speed after him   she was just upon the point of catching the poor peasant  when he threw the looking glass at her feet   at the sight of the looking glass  the like of which she had never seen before  the girl checked herself  picked it up  and looked in it   seeing her own face  she fancied there was another girl looking at her   while she was thus occupied the man ran so far that she could not possibly overtake him   when the girl saw that further pursuit was useless  she turned back  and the peasant  joyful and unhurt  reached his home   once within doors he showed the hair to his wife and children  and told them all that had happened to him  but his wife only laughed at the story  the peasant  however  took no heed of her ridicule  but went to a neighboring town to sell the hair   he was soon surrounded by a crowd of people  and some merchants began to bid for his prize   one merchant offered him one gold piece  another two  for the single hair  and so on  until the price rose to a hundred gold pieces   meanwhile the king  hearing of the wonderful red hair  ordered the peasant to be called in  and offered him a thousand gold pieces for it   the man joyfully sold it for that sum   what wonderful kind of hair was this after all   the king split it carefully open from end to end  and in it was found the story of many marvelous secrets of nature  and of things that had happened since the creation of the world   thus the peasant became rich  and henceforth lived happily with his wife and children   the child he had seen in his dream  was an angel sent down from heaven to succor him  and to reveal to mankind the knowledge of many wonderful things which had hitherto remained unexplained   the language of animals  by w  s  karajich  a certain man had a shepherd who had served him faithfully and honestly for many years   one day  as the shepherd was tending his sheep  he heard a hissing noise in the forest  and wondered what it could he   he went  therefore  into the wood in the direction of the sound  to learn what it was   there he saw that the dry grass and leaves had caught fire  and in the middle of a burning circle a snake was hissing   the shepherd stopped to see what the snake would do  for the fire was burning all around it  and the flames approached it nearer and nearer every moment   then the snake cried from amid the fire    oh  shepherd   for heaven s sake save me from this fire    the shepherd stretched out his crook over the flames to the snake  and the snake passed along it on to his hand  and from his hand it crawled to his neck  where it twisted itself round   when the shepherd perceived this  he was greatly alarmed  and said to the snake    what have i done in an evil hour   have i saved you to my own destruction    the snake answered him   fear not  but carry me to my father s house  my father is the king of the snakes    the shepherd  however  began to beg the snake to excuse him  saying that he could not leave the sheep  but the snake answered    be not troubled about the sheep  no harm shall happen to them  only go as fast as you can    the shepherd then walked through the forest with the snake until he came to a gate which was entirely made of snakes knotted together  there the snake on the shepherd s neck gave a whistle  and all the other snakes untwisted themselves   then the snake said to the shepherd    when we come to my father s palace he will give you whatever you ask for  silver  gold  and precious stones   do you  however  take nothing of these  but beg to know the language of the brutes and other creatures   he will refuse you this for a long time  but at last he will grant your request    meanwhile they came to the palace  to the father  who  shedding many tears  cried    for heaven s sake   my dearest daughter  where have you been    and she told him in due order how she had been surrounded by the forest fire  and how the shepherd had rescued her   then the king of the snakes turned to the shepherd and said to him    what would you have me give you for the deliverance of my daughter    the shepherd answered   only let me understand the language of animals  i want nothing else    then the king said   that is not good for you  for if i were to bestow upon you the gift of the knowledge of the tongue of animals  and you were to tell anyone of it  you would instantly die   ask  therefore  for something else  whatever you desire to possess  i will give to you    to which the shepherd replied    if you wish to give me anything  then grant me the knowledge of the language of brute creatures  but if you do not care to give me that  farewell  and god protect you   i want nothing else    and the shepherd turned to leave the place   then the king called him back  saying    stay   come here to me  since you will have it at all hazards   open your mouth    the shepherd opened his mouth  and the king of the snakes breathed into it  and said    do you now breathe into my mouth    the shepherd breathed into his mouth  and the snake king breathed again into that of the shepherd   after they had breathed each three times into the other s mouth  the king said    now you understand the language of animals  and of all created things  go in peace  and god be with you   but for the life of you  tell no one of this  if you do  you will die on the instant    the shepherd returned home through the forest   as he walked he heard and understood all that the birds said  and the grass and all the other things that are upon the earth   when he came to his sheep and found them all together and quite safe  he laid himself down to rest  scarcely had he lain down when there flew two ravens toward him  who took their perch upon a tree  and began to talk together in their own language    what if that shepherd only knew that underneath the place where the black lamb lies there is a cellar full of silver and gold    when the shepherd heard this  he went to his master  and told him of it   the master took a cart with him  and they dug down to a door leading to the cave  and removed the treasure to his house   but the master was an honest man  and gave all the treasure to the shepherd  saying    my son  all this treasure is yours  for heaven has given it to you  buy yourself a house with it  marry  and live happily in it    the shepherd took the treasure  built himself a house  and  having married  lived a happy life   soon he became known as the richest man  not only in his own village  but so rich that there was not his equal in the whole neighborhood   he had his own shepherd  cow keeper  hostler  and swineherd  plenty of goods and chattels  and great riches   one day  just before christmas  he said to his wife   get some wine  and some brandy  and all things necessary  to morrow we will go to the farmyard and take the good things to the shepherds that they may also enjoy themselves    the wife followed his directions and prepared all that he had told her  when they arrived on the following day at the farmhouse  the master said to the shepherds in the evening     come here  all of you  eat  drink  and be merry   i will watch over the flocks for you to night    and he went  in very deed  and remained with the flocks   about midnight the wolves began to howl and the dogs to bark  and the wolves said in their language    may we come in and do what mischief we like   then you  too  shall have your share    and the dogs answered in their language   come in  and we will eat our fill with you    but among the dogs there was an old one  who had but two teeth in his head  and he said to the wolves    that will not do   so long as i have my two teeth in my head you shall do no harm to my master nor his    the master heard it all  and understood what was said   on the following morning he ordered all the dogs to be killed save only the old one   the hinds said   heaven forbid  sir  that would be a great pity    but the master answered   do what i have told you    then he prepared to return home with his wife  and they both mounted their horses   and as they rode on  the husband got a little ahead  while the wife fell behind   at last the husband s horse neighed  and called to the mare    come on   make haste   why do you lag behind    and the mare answered him   ah yes  it is all very easy for you  you have only one to carry  the master  while i have to carry two  the mistress and her baby    the husband turned round and laughed  and his wife seeing this  urged the mare forward  overtook her husband  and asked him what he had been laughing at    nothing  i do not know  just something that came into my mind   answered the husband   but the wife was not satisfied with this answer  and she pressed him again and again to tell her why he had laughed   but he excused himself  and said    let me alone  wife   what is the matter with you   i do not know myself why i laughed    but the more he denied her the more she insisted upon his telling her what he had been laughing at   at last the husband said to her    know then  that if i tell you the reason  i shall instantly die    the woman  however  did not care for that  but urged him to tell her notwithstanding   meanwhile they had reached home   the husband ordered a coffin to be made immediately  and when it was ready he had it placed before the house  and said to his wife    see now  i now lay me down in this coffin  and then tell you why i laughed  but as soon as i have told you i shall die    the husband lay down in the coffin  and looked around him for the last time   and there came the old dog from the farmyard  and sat down at his head and whined   the husband seeing this  said to his wife    bring a piece of bread and give it to this dog    the wife brought out a piece of bread  and threw it down to the dog  but the dog would not even look at it   then the house cock ran up  and began to pick at the bread  and the dog said to it    you miserable greedy thing  you   you can eat  and yet you see that the master is going to die    the cock answered the dog   and let him die since he is such a fool   i have a hundred wives  and i call them all together whenever i find a grain of corn  and as soon as they have come round me  i swallow it myself   and if any one of them got angry  i should be at her directly with my beak   the master has only one wife  and he cannot even manage her    when the husband heard this he quickly sprang out of the coffin  took up a stick  and called his wife into the room    come  wife   he said   i will tell you what you so much want to hear    then as he beat her with the stick he cried   this is it  wife   this is it    in this way he quieted his wife  and she never asked him again what he had been laughing at   the emperor trojan s goat s ears  by w  s  karajich  there once lived an emperor whose name was trojan   this emperor had goat s ears  and he used to call in barber after barber to shave him  but whoever went in never came out again  for while the barber was shaving him  the emperor would ask what he observed uncommon in him  and when the barber would answer that he observed his goat s ears  the emperor would immediately cut him into pieces   at last it came to the turn of a certain barber to go who feigned illness  and sent his apprentice instead   when the apprentice appeared before the emperor he was asked why his master did not come  and he answered   because he is ill    then the emperor sat down  and allowed the youth to shave him   as he shaved him the apprentice noticed the emperor s goat s ears  but when trojan asked him what he had observed  he answered   i have observed nothing    then the emperor gave him twelve ducats  and said to him    from this time forth you shall always come and shave me   when the apprentice came home  his master asked him how he got on at the emperor s  and the youth answered     all well  and the emperor has told me that i am to shave him in future    then he showed the twelve ducats he had received  but as to the emperor s goat s ears  of that he said nothing    from this time forth the apprentice went regularly to trojan to shave him  and for each shaving he received twelve ducats  but he told no one that the emperor had goat s ears   at last it began to worry and torment him that he dare tell no one his secret  and he became sick and began to pine away   his master  who could not fail to observe this  asked him what ailed him  and after much pressing the apprentice confessed that he had something on his heart which he dared not confide to anyone  and he added   if i could only tell it to somebody  i should feel better at once    then said the master    tell it to me  and i will faithfully keep it from everybody else  or if you fear to trust me with it  then go to the confessor and confide it to him  but if you will not do even that  then go into the fields outside the town  there dig a hole  thrust your head into it  and tell the earth three times what you know  then throw the mold in again and fill up the hole    the apprentice chose the last course  went into the field outside the city  dug a hole  into which he thrust his head  and called out three times    the emperor trojan has goat s ears    then he filled up the hole again  and with his mind quite relieved went home   when some time had passed by  there sprang an elder tree out of this very hole  and three slender sterns grew up  beautiful and straight as tapers   some shepherds found this elder  cut off one of the stems  and made a pipe of it   but as soon as they began to blow into the new pipe  out burst the words    the emperor trojan has goat s ears    the news of this strange occurrence spread immediately through the whole city  and at last the emperor trojan himself heard the children blowing on a pipe    the emperor trojan has goat s ears    he sent instantly for the barber s apprentice  and shouted to him    heh   what is this you have been telling the people about me    the poor youth began at once to explain that he had indeed noticed the emperor s ears  but had never told a soul of it   the emperor tore his saber out of its sheath to hew the apprentice down  at which the youth was so frightened that he told the whole story in its order  how he had confessed himself to the earth  how an elder tree had sprang up on the very spot  and how  when a pipe was made of one of its sterns  the tale was sounded in every direction   then the emperor took the apprentice with him in a carriage to the place  to convince himself of the truth of the story  and when they arrived there they found there was only a single stem left   the emperor trojan ordered a pipe to be made out of this stem  that he might hear how it sounded   as soon as the pipe was ready  and one of them blew into it  out poured the words    the emperor trojan has goat s ears    then the emperor was convinced that nothing on this earth could be hidden  spared the barber apprentices life  and henceforth allowed any barber  without exception  to come and shave him   the maiden who was wiser than the king  by w  s  karajich  there once lived a poor man in a miserable hovel  who had no one with him save an only daughter   but she was very wise  and went about everywhere seeking alms  and taught her father also to speak in a becoming manner when he begged   it happened once that the poor man came to the king and asked for a gift   the king demanded whence he came  and who had taught him to speak so well   the man said whence he came  and that it was his daughter who had taught him    and who taught your daughter    asked the king   the poor man answered   god  and our great poverty     then the king gave him thirty eggs  saying    take these eggs to your daughter  and tell her to hatch chickens out of them  and i will reward her handsomely  but if she cannot hatch them  it will go ill with you    the poor man went crying back to his hovel  and related to his daughter what had passed   the maiden saw at once that the eggs had been boiled  but she told her father to go to rest  and assured him that she would see that all went well   the father followed her advice  and went to sleep  the maiden took a pot  filled it with water and beans  and set it on the fire   on the following morning  the beans being quite boiled  she told her father to take a plow and oxen  and to plow along the road where the king would pass    and   she added   when you see the king  take the beans  sow them  and cry   hi   go on  oxen mine   heaven be with me  and make my boiled beans take root and grow    and when the king asks you how it is possible for boiled beans to grow  answer him  that it is quite as possible as for boiled eggs to yield chickens    the poor man hearkened to his daughter  went away  and began to plow  when he saw the king coming he began to cry    hi  go on  oxen mine   god help me  and make my boiled beans take root and grow    the king  hearing these words  stopped on the road  and said to the poor man    here  fellow   how is it possible for boiled beans to grow    and the poor man answered him    heaven prosper you  king   just as possible as for boiled eggs to yield chickens    the king guessed at once that it was the poor man s daughter who had taught him this answer   he ordered his servants to seize him and bring him into his presence   then he gave him a bundle of flax  and said to him    take this flax and make out of it ropes and sails and all that is wanted on shipboard  if you do not  you shall lose your head    the poor man took the bundle in great fear  and went crying home to his daughter  to whom he related all that had passed   but the maiden sent him again to rest with the promise that all should go well   on the following day she took a small piece of wood  awoke her father  and said to him    take this wood  and carry it to the king  let him cut a spinning wheel  a spindle  and a loom out of it  and i will do all that he demands of me    the poor man again followed the directions of his daughter  he went to the king and delivered the maiden s message   the king was astonished at hearing this  and began to think what he should do next   at last he took up a small cup  and said as he gave it to the father    take this cup to your daughter  and let her empty the sea with it  so that it shall become like a dry field    the poor man obeyed with tears in his eyes  and took the cup to his daughter with the king s message   but the maiden told him he need only leave the matter till the morning  when she would see to it   in the morning she called her father  and gave him a pound of tow to take to the king  and bade him say    let the king stop up all the springs and river mouths of the earth with this tow  and then will i dry up the sea for him    and the poor man went and told this to the king   now the king saw that this maiden was wiser that he was himself  and he ordered her to be brought before him   and when the father and daughter stood in his presence and bowed before him  he said to the daughter    tell me  girl  what is it that man hears the farthest    and the maiden answered   great king   that which man hears the farthest is the thunder  and a lie    upon this the king took hold of his beard  and turning to his councilors  demanded of them    tell me what my beard is worth    and when one valued it at so much  and another at so much more  the maiden told them outright that they could not guess it    the king s beard   she said   is of as much worth as three rainy days in summer time    the king was astonished and exclaimed   the maiden has made the best answer    then he asked her if she would be his wife  nor would he desist from pressing his suit  until she agreed to it   the maiden bent before him and said    glorious king   let it be as you will  but i beg of you to write on a piece of paper with your own hand  that  should you ever be angry with me  and should drive me forth from your palace  i shall be at liberty to take whatever i love dearest away with me    and the king agreed and wrote out the paper   after some time had passed away  it came  in fact  to pass  that the king became one day so angry with his wife  that he said to her    i will have you no longer for my wife  leave my palace  and go where you will     illustrious king    answered the queen   i will obey you   permit me  however  to stay here over the night  then in the morning i will go forth    the king granted her prayer  and the queen before supper mixed some brandy and some sweet herbs in the king s wine  and pressed him to partake of it  saying    drink  o king  and be merry   to morrow we part  and believe me  i shall then be happier than when i married you    the king drank too much  and when he was fast asleep  the queen had him laid in a wagon ready prepared  and drove with him into a rocky cavern  and when the king awoke in the cavern  and saw where he was  he cried out    who has brought me here     i have brought you here   answered the queen   the king demanded of her    why have you done this   have i not told you that you are no longer my wife    then said she  as she drew forth a sheet of paper    it is true what you say  but see what you yourself have laid down on this sheet  that when i should leave you  i might take with me  from your palace  that which i loved best    when the king heard this  he kissed her  and went back with her to the palace   the three sons  by lady gregory  i ll tell you a story  says the old man who was bringing fish from the sea  and after that i ll be going on to ballinrobe  to one that has a shop there and that was reared by my grandmother   it is likely he ll give me a tasty suit of clothes   working all my life i am  working with the flail in the barn  working with the spade at the potato tilling and the potato digging  breaking stones on the road   and four years ago the wife died  and it s lonesome to be housekeeping alone   there was a king long ago in ireland  and he had three sons  and one of them was something silly   there came a sickness on the king  and he called his three sons  and he said to them that he had knowledge the only thing would cure him was the apples from burnett s orchard  and he bade them to go look for them  for that orchard was in some far away place  and no one could tell where it was   the three sons went then  and they caught their horses  and put on their bridles  and they set out  and went on till they came to three crossroads   there they stopped  and they settled among themselves that each one of them would take one of the roads and go searching for the apples  and they would meet at the same place at the end of a year and a day   the youngest son  that was a bit silly  took the crossest of the roads  and he went on till he came to a cottage by the roadside   he went in  and there was a withered old man in the house  and he said    there is a great welcome before the king of ireland s son    the son was astonished at that because he thought no one could know him   he was well received there  and in the course of the evening he asked the old man did he know where was burnett s garden    i am a hundred years old   said the man   and i never heard of such a place   but i have a brother   he said   that is a hundred years older than i am  and it may be he would know   he said   so in the morning he gave a canoe to the king s son  and it went on of itself without him turning or guiding it  till it brought him to the old man s brother  and he got a welcome there and good treatment  and in the course of the night he asked that old man did he know where was burnett s orchard    i do not   said he   though i am two hundred years old i never heard of it   but go on   he said   to a brother i have that has a hundred years more than myself    so in the morning  he went into the canoe  and it went on of itself till it came to where the third old man was  that was older again than the other two  and the king s son asked did he know where was burnett s garden    i do not   he said   although i am three hundred years old  but i will tell you how you will know it   he said    go on till you come to shore  where you will see a swan gander standing by the water  and he is the one that can tell you and can bring you to it   he said   and ask him to bring you to that garden in the name of the almighty god    so the king s son went on in the canoe till he came where the swan  gander was standing on the shore    can you tell me   says he   where can i get the apples that are in burnett s orchard   and can you bring me there    he said    indeed   said the swan gander   i am in no way obliged to your leader  or to whoever it was sent you to me and gave you that teaching   and those apples are well minded   he said   by wolves  and the only time they sleep is for three hours once in every seven years   and it chances they are asleep for those three hours at this time  and so i will bring you there   he said   with that he stretched out his wings  and he bade the king s son to get on his back   and it was long before he could start flying with the weight that was on him  but at last he flew away  and he brought the king s son to burnett s garden  and there was a high wall around it  but he flew over the wall  and put him down in the garden   the king s son filled his bag with the apples  and when he had done that he went looking around  and he came to a large cottage in the garden  and he went in  and there was no one in the house but a beautiful young girl  and she was asleep   so he went away  but he brought with him the gold rings and the gold garters that he saw there in the window   he got up again on the back of the swan gander  but it was hard for it to rise with the weight of the bag of apples   but it did rise at last  and it brought him to where the old man was that was three hundred years old   the king s son gave one of the apples to the old man  and no sooner did he eat it than his age left him  and he was like a boy of fifteen years   he went on then to the two other old men  and gave an apple to both of them  and no sooner did they eat it than they were like young boys again   then the king s son went back to the crossroads  for it was the end of the year and a day  and he was the first to come there  and he fell asleep   the two brothers came and saw him there  and they stole the bag of apples from under his head and put in the place of it a bag of apples that were no use at all   then they went on to their father s house  and they gave him the apples they had stolen  and he was cured on the moment  but they told him that what the youngest son was bringing to him was poison apples  that would bring him to his death   the king was very angry when he heard that  and he went to his butler and said   go out to the wood where my son is  and shoot him  and bring his heart here with you on the top of a gun and throw it to the dogs at the door  for i will never have him  or anything belonging to him  brought into the house   he said   so the butler got the gun  and went out to the wood  and when he saw the young man he was going to shoot him    why would you do that   said he   so the butler told him all the father ordered him  and the young man said   do not shoot me  but save me   and this is what you will do   go into the wood until you meet with a woodcock  and shoot it  and take the heart out of it  for that is most like the heart of a man   bring the woodcock s heart to my father s house   he said   and throw it to the dogs at the door    so the butler did that  and spared him  and took the woodcock s heart and threw it to the dogs at the door   it was a good while after that  a beautiful young lady came to the king s doorway in a coach and four  and stopped at the door    send out my husband to me here   she said   so the eldest son came out to her   was it you came to the garden for the apples    says she    it was   says he    what things did you take notice of in the cottage where i was   says she   so he began telling of this thing and that thing that never was in it at all   and when she heard that she gave him a clout that knocked his head as solid as any stone in the wall   then the second son came out  and she asked him the same question  and he told the same lies  and she gave him another clout that left his head as solid as any stone in the wall   when the king heard all that  he knew they had deceived him  and that it was the youngest son who got the apples for his cure  and he began to cry after him and to lament that he was not living to come back again    would you like to know he is living yet    says the butler   i would sooner hear it than any word ever i heard   says the king    well he is living yet  and is in the wood   says the butler   when the young lady heard that  she bade the butler bring her to where he was  and they went together to the wood  and there they found him  where he had been living on the fruits of trees through the most of the year   when the young lady saw him  she said   was it you came to the house where i was in the garden     it was   says he    what things did you take notice of in it     here they are   says he   and he put his hand in his pocket  and brought out the gold rings and the golden garters  and the other signs he had brought away   so she knew that he was the right one  and she married him  and they lived happy ever after  and there was great rejoicing in the king of ireland s house   hok lee and the dwarfs  retold by andrew lang  there once lived in a small town in china a man named hok lee   he was a steady  industrious man  who not only worked hard at his trade  but did all his own housework as well  for he had no wife to do it for him   what an excellent  industrious man is this hok lee   said his neighbors    how hard he works   he never leaves his house to amuse himself or to take a holiday as others do    but hok lee was by no means the virtuous person his neighbors thought him   true  he worked hard enough by day  but at night  when all respectable folk were fast asleep  he used to steal out and join a dangerous band of robbers  who broke into rich people s houses and carried off all they could lay hands on   this state of things went on for some time  and though a thief was caught now and then and punished  no suspicion ever fell on hok lee  he was such a very respectable  hard working man   hok lee had already amassed a good store of money as his share of the proceeds of these robberies  when it happened one morning on going to market that a neighbor said to him    why  hok lee  what is the matter with your face   one side of it is all swelled up    true enough  hok lee s right cheek was twice the size of his left  and it soon began to feel very uncomfortable    i will bind up my face   said hok lee    doubtless the warmth will cure the swelling    but no such thing   next day it was worse  and day by day it grew bigger and bigger till it was nearly as large as his head and became very painful   hok lee was at his wits  end what to do   not only was his check unsightly and painful  but his neighbors began to jeer and make fun of him  which hurt his feelings very much indeed   one day  as luck would have it  a traveling doctor came to the town  he sold not only all kinds of medicine  but also dealt in many strange charms against witches and evil spirits   hok lee determined to consult him and asked him into his house   after the doctor had examined him carefully he spoke thus    this  hok lee  is no ordinary swelled face   i strongly suspect you have been doing some wrong deed which has called down the anger of the spirits on you   none of my drugs will avail to cure you  but if you are willing to pay me handsomely i can tell you how you may be cured    then hok lee and the doctor began to bargain together  and it was a long time before they could come to terms   however  the doctor got the better of it in the end  for he was determined not to part with his secret under a certain price  and hok lee had no mind to carry his huge cheek about with him to the end of his days   so he was obliged to part with the greater portion of his ill gotten gains   when the doctor had pocketed the money he told hok lee to go on the first night of the full moon to a certain wood and there to watch by a particular tree   after a time he would see the dwarfs and little sprites who live underground come out to dance   when they saw him they would be sure to make him dance too    and mind you dance your very best   added the doctor    if you dance well and please them they will grant you a petition and you can then beg to be cured  but if you dance badly they will most likely do you some mischief out of spite    with that he took leave and departed   happily the first night of the full moon was near  and at the proper time hok lee set out for the wood   with a little trouble he found the tree the doctor had described  and feeling nervous he climbed up into it   he had hardly settled himself on a branch when he saw the little dwarfs assembling in the moonlight   they came from all sides  till at length there appeared to be hundreds of them   they seemed in high glee and danced and skipped and capered about  while hok lee grew so eager watching them that he crept farther and farther along his branch till at length it gave a loud crack   all the dwarfs stood still  and hok lee felt as if his heart stood still also   then one of the dwarfs called out   some one is up in that tree   come down at once  whoever you are  or we must come and fetch you    in great terror hok lee proceeded to come down  but he was so nervous that he tripped near the ground and came rolling down in the most absurd manner   when he had picked himself up he came forward with a low bow  and the dwarf who had first spoken and who appeared to be the leader said   now  then  who art thou and what brings thee here    so hok lee told him the sad story of his swelled cheek  and how he had been advised to come to the forest and beg the dwarfs to cure him    it is well   replied the dwarf    we will see about that   first  however  thou must dance before us   should thy dancing please us  perhaps we may be able to do something  but shouldst thou dance badly we shall assuredly punish thee  so now take warning and dance away    with that  he and all the other dwarfs sat down in a large ring  leaving hok lee to dance alone in the middle   he felt half frightened to death  and besides was a good deal shaken by his fall from the tree and did not feel at all inclined to dance   but the dwarfs were not to be trifled with    begin    cried their leader  and  begin    shouted the rest in chorus   so in despair hok lee began   first he hopped on one foot and then on the other  but he was so stiff and so nervous that he made but a poor attempt  and after a time sank down on the ground and vowed he could dance no more   the dwarfs were very angry   they crowded round hok lee and abused him   thou to come here to be cured  indeed   they cried    thou hast brought one big cheek with thee  but thou shalt take away two    and with that they ran off and disappeared  leaving hok lee to find his way home as best he might   he hobbled away  weary and depressed  and not a little anxious on account of the dwarfs  threat   nor were his fears unfounded  for when he rose next morning his left cheek was swelled up as big as his right  and he could hardly see out of his eyes   hok lee felt in despair  and his neighbors jeered at him more than ever   the doctor  too  had disappeared  so there was nothing for it but to try the dwarfs once more   he waited a month till the first night of the full moon came round again  and then he trudged back to the forest and sat down under the tree from which he had fallen   he had not long to wait   ere long the dwarfs came trooping out till all were assembled    i don t feel quite easy   said one    i feel as if some horrid human being were near us    when hok lee heard this he came forward and bent down to the ground before the dwarfs  who came crowding round and laughed heartily at his comical appearance with his two big cheeks     what dost thou want   they asked  and hok lee proceeded to tell them of his fresh misfortunes and begged so hard to be allowed one more trial at dancing that the dwarfs consented  for there is nothing they love so much as being amused   now  hok lee knew how much depended on his dancing well  so he plucked up a good spirit and began  first quite slowly and faster by degrees  and he danced so well and gracefully  and made such new and wonderful steps  that the dwarfs were quite delighted with him   they clapped their tiny hands and shouted    well done  hok lee  well done   go on dance more  for we are pleased    and hok lee danced on and on  till he really could dance no more and was obliged to stop   then the leader of the dwarfs said   we are well pleased  hok lee  and as a recompense for thy dancing thy face shall he cured   farewell    with these words he and the other dwarfs vanished  and hok lee  putting his hands to his face  found to his great joy that his cheeks were reduced to their natural size   the way home seemed short and easy to him  and he went to bed happy and resolved never to go out robbing again   next day the whole town was full of the news of hok s sudden cure   his neighbors questioned him  but could get nothing from him  except the fact that he had discovered a wonderful cure for all kinds of diseases   after a time a rich neighbor  who had been ill for some years  came and offered to give hok lee a large sum of money if he would tell him how he might get cured   hok lee consented on condition that he swore to keep the secret   he did so  and hok lee told him of the dwarfs and their dances   the neighbor went off  carefully obeyed hok lee s directions  and was duly cured by the dwarfs   then another and another came to hok lee to beg his secret  and from each he extracted a vow of secrecy and a large sum of money   this went on for some years  so that at length hok lee became a very wealthy man and ended his days in peace and prosperity   a dreadful boar  by adele m  fielde  a poor old woman  who lived with her one little granddaughter in a wood  was out gathering sticks for fuel and found a green stalk of sugar cane which she added to her bundle   she presently met an elf in the form of a wild boar  that asked her for the cane   she declined giving it to him  saying that at her age to stoop and to rise again was to earn what she picked up  and she was going to take the cane home and let her little granddaughter suck its sap   the boar  angry at her refusal  said that during the coming night he would come and eat her granddaughter instead of the cane  and went off into the wood   when the old woman reached her cabin she sat down by the door and wailed  for she knew that she had no means of defending herself against the boar   while she sat crying a vender of needles came along and asked her what was the matter   she told him  but all that he could do for her was to give her a box of needles   the old woman stuck the needles thickly over the lower half of the door  on its outer side  and then went on crying   just then a man came along with a basket of crabs  heard her lamentations  and stopped to inquire what was the matter   she told him  but he said he knew no help for her  but he would do the best he could for her by giving her half his crabs   the woman put the crabs in her water jar  behind her door  and again sat down and cried   a farmer  who was coming along from the fields  leading his ox  also asked the cause of her distress and heard her story   he said he was sorry he could not think of any way of preventing the evil she expected  but that he would leave his ox to stay all night with her  as it might be a sort of company for her in her loneliness   she led the ox into her cabin  tied it to the head of her bedstead  gave it some straw  and then sat down to cry again   a courier returning on horseback from a neighboring town was the next to pass her door  and he dismounted to inquire what troubled her  having heard her tale  he said he would leave his horse to stay with her  and make the ox more contented   so she tied the horse to the foot of the bed  and  thinking how surely evil was coming upon her  she burst out crying anew   a boy just then came along with a snapping turtle that he had caught and stopped to ask what had happened to her   on learning the cause of her weeping he said it was no use to contend against sprites  but that he would give her his snapping turtle as a proof of his sympathy   she took the turtle  tied it in front of her bedstead  and continued to cry   some men who were carrying millstones then came along  inquired into her trouble  and expressed their compassion by giving her a millstone  which they rolled into her back yard   while they were doing this a man went by carrying hoes and a pickaxe  and he stopped and asked her why she was crying so hard   she told him her grief  and he said he would gladly help her if he could  but he was only a well digger and could do nothing for her except to dig a well   she pointed out a place in the backyard  and he went to work and quickly dug a well   on his departure the old woman cried again  until a paper seller came and inquired what was the matter   when she told him he gave her a large sheet of white paper  as a token of pity  and she laid it smoothly over the mouth of the well   nightfall came   the old woman shut and barred her door  put her granddaughter snugly on the wall side of the bed  and then lay down beside her to await the foe   at midnight the boar came and threw himself against the door to break it in   the needles wounded him sorely  so that when he had gained an entrance he was heated and thirsty  and went to the water jar to drink   when he thrust in his snout the crabs attacked him  clung to his bristles  and pinched his ears  till he rolled over and over to free himself   then in a rage he approached the front of the bed  but the snapping turtle nipped his tail and made him retreat under the feet of the horse  who kicked him over to the ox  and the ox tossed him back to the horse   thus beset  he was glad to escape to the back yard to take a rest and to consider the situation   seeing a clean paper spread on the ground  he went to lie upon it  and fell into the well   the old woman  hearing the fall  rushed out and rolled the millstone down on him and crushed him   the five queer brothers  by adele m  fielde  an old woman had five grown up sons that looked just alike   the eldest could gulp up the ocean at a mouthful  the second was hard enough to nick steel  the third had extensible legs  the fourth was unaffected by fire  the fifth lived without breathing   they all concealed their peculiar traits  and their neighbors did not know they were queer   the eldest supported the family by fishing  going alone to the sea  and bringing back loads of spoil   the neighbors often besought him to teach their sons how to fish  and he at last let all their boys go with him  one day  to learn his art   on reaching the shore he sucked the sea into his mouth  and sent the boys to the dry bottom to collect the fish   when he was tired of holding the water  he beckoned to the boys to return  but they were playing among strange objects and paid no heed to him   when he could contain the sea no longer  he had to let it flow back into its former basin  and all the boys were drowned   as he went homeward  he passed the doom of the parents  who inquired how many fish their sons had caught and how long they would be in coming back   he told them the facts  but they would not excuse him  they dragged him before the magistrate to account for the loss of their children   he defended himself by saying he had not invited the boys to go with him  and had consented to their going only when the parents had repeatedly urged him  that after the boys were on the ocean bed  he had done his utmost to induce them to come ashore  that he had held the water as long as he could  and had then put it in the sea basin solely because nothing else would contain it   notwithstanding this defense the judges decided that since he took the boys away and did not bring them back  he was guilty of murder and sentenced him to be beheaded   he entreated leave to pay  before his execution  one visit to his aged mother  and this was granted   he went alone and told his brothers of his doom  and the second brother returned in his stead to the judge  thanked him for having given him permission to perform a duty required by filial piety  and said he was then ready to die   he knelt with bowed head and the headsman brought the knife down across the back of his neck  but the knife was nicked and the neck was left unharmed   a second knife and a third of finer steel were brought and tried by headsmen who were accustomed to sever heads clean off at one stroke  having spoiled their best blades without so much as scratching his neck  they took him back to prison and informed the judge that the sentence could not be executed   the judge accordingly decreed that he should be dropped into the sea which covered his victims   when the old woman s son heard this decision he said that he took leave of his mother supposing that his head was to be cut off  and that if he was to be drowned he must go to her and make known his fate and get her blessing anew   permission being given  he went and told his brothers what had happened   the third brother took the place of the second and presented himself before the judge as the criminal that was to be sunk in the sea   he was carried far from shore and thrown overboard  but he stretched his legs till his feet touched bottom  and he stood with his head in the air   they hauled him aboard and took him farther from land  but still his extensible legs supported him above the waters  then they sailed to mid ocean and cast him into its greatest depths  but his legs still lengthened so that he was not drowned   they brought him back to the judge  reported what had been done  and said that some other method of destroying him must be followed   on hearing this the judge condemned him to death by being boiled in oil   while the caldron was being heated he begged and obtained permission to go and tell his mother of the way he had survived from the attempt to drown him  and of the manner in which he was soon to be taken off   his brothers having heard the latest judgment  the fourth one went to bear the penalty of the law and was lowered into the kettle of boiling oil   in this he disported himself as if in a tepid bath  and he even asked his executioners to stir up the fire a little to increase the warmth   finding that he could not be fried  he was remanded to prison   at this the populace  the bereaved parents  and the magistrate joined in an effort to invent a sure method of putting him to death   water  fire  and sword all having failed  they finally fixed upon smothering him in a vast cream cake   the whole country round made contributions of flour for the pastry  of sugar for the filling  and of bricks for a huge oven  and it was made and baked on a plain outside the city walls   meanwhile the prisoner was allowed to go and bid his mother farewell  and the fifth brother secretly became his substitute   when the cake was done  a multitude of people with oxen  horses  and ropes dragged it to the execution ground  and within it the culprit was interred   as he was able to exist without air he rested peacefully till the next midnight  and then safely crawled forth  returned to his home  and dwelt there happily for many years with his remarkable brothers   the accomplished and lucky teakettle  by a  b  mitford  a long time ago  at a temple called morinji  there was an old teakettle   one day  when the priest of the temple was about to hang it over the hearth to boil the water for his tea  to his amazement the kettle all of a sudden put forth the head and tail of a badger   what a wonderful kettle  to come out all over fur   the priest  thunderstruck  called in the novices or assistants of the temple to see the sight  and while they were stupidly staring  one suggesting one thing and another another  the kettle  jumping up into the air  began flying about the room   more astonished than ever  the priest and his pupils tried to pursue it  but no thief or cat was ever half so sharp as the wonderful badger kettle   at last  however  they managed to knock it down and secure it  and  holding it in with their united efforts  they forced it into a box  intending to carry it off and throw it away in some distant place  so that they might no more be plagued with the goblin   for this day their troubles were over  but as luck would have it  the tinker who was in the habit of working for the temple called in  and the priest suddenly bethought him that it was a pity to throw the kettle away for nothing  and that he might as well get a trifle for it  no matter how small   so he brought out the kettle  which had resumed its former shape and had got rid of its head and tail  and showed it to the tinker   when the tinker saw the kettle  he offered twenty copper coins for it  and the priest was only too glad to close the bargain and be rid of his troublesome piece of furniture   and the tinker trudged off home with his pack and his new purchase   that night  as he lay asleep  he heard a strange noise near his pillow  so he peeped out from under the bedclothes and there he saw the kettle that he had bought in the temple covered with fur and walking about on four legs   the tinker started up in a fright to see what it could all mean  when all of a sudden the kettle resumed its former shape   this happened over and over again  until at last the tinker showed the teakettle to a friend of his  who said   this is certainly an accomplished and lucky teakettle you should take it about as a show  with songs and accompaniments of musical instruments  and make it dance and walk on the tight rope    the tinker  thinking this good advice  made arrangements with a showman  and set up an exhibition   the noise of the kettle s performances soon spread abroad  until even the princes of the land sent to order the tinker to come to them  and he grew rich beyond all expectations   even the princesses  too  and the great ladies of the court  took great delight in the dancing kettle  so that no sooner had it shown its tricks in one place than it was time for them to keep some other engagement   at last the tinker grew so rich that he took the kettle back to the temple  where it was laid up as a precious treasure and worshiped as a saint   the adventures of little peachling  by a  b  mitford  many hundred years ago there lived an honest old woodcutter and his wife   one fine morning the old man went off to the hills with his bill hook to gather a faggot of sticks  while his wife went down to the river to wash the dirty clothes   when she came to the river  she saw a peach floating down the stream  so she picked it up and carried it homeward with her  thinking to give it to her husband to eat when he should come in   the old man soon came down from the hills  and the good wife set the peach before him  when  just as she was inviting him to eat it  the fruit split in two and a little baby was born into the world   so the old couple took the babe and brought it up as their own  and because it had been born in a peach  they called it momotaro  or little peachhing   by degrees little peachling grew up to be strong and brave  and at last one day he said to his old foster parents    i am going to the ogres  island  to carry off the riches they have stored up there   pray  then  make me some millet dumplings for my journey    so the old folks ground the millet and made the dumplings for him  and little peachling  after taking an affectionate leave of them  cheerfully set out on his travels   as he was journeying on  he fell in with an ape  who gibbered at him  and said    kia   kia   kia   where are you off to  little peachling     i m going to the ogres  island  to carry off their treasure   answered little peachling    what are you carrying at your girdle     i m carrying the very best millet dumplings in all japan    if you ll give me one  i will go with you   said the ape   so little peachhing gave one of his dumplings to the ape  who received it and followed him   when he had gone a little farther  he heard a pheasant calling    ken   ken   ken   where are you off to  master peachling    little peachling answered as before  and the pheasant  having begged and obtained a millet dumpling  entered his service and followed him  a little while after this they met a dog  who cried   bow   wow   wow   whither away  master peachling     i m going off to the ogres  island  to carry off their treasure    if you will give me one of those nice millet dumplings of yours  i will go with you   said the dog    with all my heart   said little peachling   so he went on his way  with the ape  the pheasant  and the dog following after him   when they got to the ogres  island  the pheasant flew over the castle gate and the ape clambered over the castle wall  while little peachling  leading the dog  forced in the gate and got into the castle  then they did battle with the ogres and put them to flight  and took their king prisoner   so all the ogres did homage to little peachling  and brought out the treasures which they had laid up   there were caps and coats that made their wearers invisible  jewels which governed the ebb and the flow of the tide  coral  musk  emeralds  amber  and tortoise shells  besides gold and silver   all these were laid before little peachling by the conquered ogres   so little peachling went home laden with riches  and maintained his foster parents in peace and plenty for the remainder of their lives   the two lizards  by annie ker  in the old days there lived two lizards  webubu and nagari   webubu was plain of speech  and moreover was unable to cry aloud  but nagari  by stretching his long neck  could produce a sweet low sound  somewhat after the manner of a whistle   nagari longed for companions  so he stretched his neck and cried  u u  u u u    then many women  hearing the sweet sound  flocked to where nagari sat  and listened to his music   this pleased nagari  and he continued to sound his long note    u u u u u   he sang  and the women sat so still  one might have thought them dead or weeping   webubu  on the contrary  had no one to cheer him in his loneliness   what can i do   he said   to draw women to me as nagari has done   i have not a sweet voice as he has   what can i do    as he was speaking a thought grew up in his heart  and he began to act  he cut a slim piece of hollow bamboo  and pierced small holes in it  thus was the first flute  duraio  born   webubu then built himself a platform high in a corkwood tree  which we call  troba  on the beach  and seating himself there he began to play his flute   the women sat patiently around nagari  while he sounded his one note   u u u    but on a sudden  upon the still air  broke the sweet voice of webubu s flute   high and sweet were the notes which webubu sent forth from his flute    m   m   said the listening women    u u u u   sang nagari    ah  ss ss ss   cried the women    deafen us not with thy  u   when we would hear this strange music    nagari was much troubled at this saying  and marveled greatly   then one woman made bold to rise up  and saying   i shall return   she went to seek the sweet music   now this woman lied  for she never returned  after a time  another woman arose and said   stay here  my friends  i shall return    then she went in like manner to look for the music   and she also lied  for she returned not   and so with each woman  until nagari was left sitting alone as he had been at the beginning   now webubu was still playing his flute on the platform he had built in the corkwood tree  when the women came in sight   he was alarmed for the safety of his frail platform  when he saw these many people advancing  and he cried   come not up into the tree   remain below  i beseech you  o women    but the women were consumed with eagerness to be close to the music which had taken their hearts  and they climbed  all of them  until they were upon the platform of webubu   then straightway what he had feared came to pass  and webubu  and his flute  and the multitude of women fell crashing through the branches of the corkwood tree to the ground beneath   and from that hour until now  all corkwood trees lean toward the earth  as i will show thee  if thou wilt go with me to the

dwelt near a large wood a poor woodcutter with his wife and two children by his former marriage  a little boy called hansel and a girl named grethel   he had little enough to break or bite  and once  when there was a great famine in the land  he could not procure even his daily bread  and as he lay thinking in his bed one evening  rolling about for trouble  he sighed  and said to his wife   what will become of us   how can we feed our children when we have no more than we can eat ourselves     know  then  my husband   answered she   we will lead them away quite early in the morning into the thickest part of the wood  and there make them a fire  and give them each a little piece of bread  then we will go to our work and leave them alone  so they will not find the way home again and we shall be freed from them     no  wife   replied he   that i can never do  how can you bring your heart to leave my children all alone in the wood  for the wild beasts will soon come and tear them to pieces     oh  you simpleton   said she   then we must all four die of hunger  you had better plane the coffins for us    but she left him no peace till he consented saying   ah  but i shall regret the poor children    the two children  however  had not gone to sleep for very hunger  and so they overheard what the stepmother said to their father   grethel wept bitterly  and said to hansel   what will become of us     be quiet  grethel   said he   do not cry  i will soon help you    and as soon as their parents had fallen asleep  he got up  put on his coat  and  unbarring the back door  slipped out   the moon shone brightly  and the white pebbles which lay before the door seemed like silver pieces  they glittered so brightly   hansel stooped down  and put as many into his pocket as it would hold  and then going back he said to grethel   be comforted  dear sister  and sleep in peace  god will not forsake us   and so saying he went to bed again   the next morning  before the sun arose  the wife went and awoke the two children    get up  you lazy things  we are going into the forest to chop wood    then she gave them each a piece of bread  saying   there is something for your dinner  do not eat it before the time  for you will get nothing else    grethel took the bread in her apron  for hansel s pocket was full of pebbles  and so they all set out upon their way   when they had gone a little distance hansel stood still  and peeped back at the house  and this he repeated several times  till his father said   hansel  what are you peeping at  and why do you lag behind   take care  and remember your legs     ah   father   said hansel   i am looking at my white cat sitting upon the roof of the house  and trying to say good by     you simpleton   said the wife   that is not a cat  it is only the sun shining on the white chimney    but in reality hansel was not looking at a cat  but every time he stopped he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path   when they came to the middle of the wood the father told the children to collect wood  and he would make them a fire  so that they should not be cold  so hansel and grethel gathered together quite a little mountain of twigs   then they set fire to them  and as the flame burned up high the wife said   now  you children  lie down near the fire and rest yourself  while we go into the forest and chop wood  when we are ready  i will come and call you    hansel and grethel sat down by the fire  and when it was noon each ate the piece of bread  and  because they could hear the blows of an ax  they thought their father was near  but it was not an ax  but a branch which he had bound to a withered tree  so as to be blown to and fro by the wind   they waited so long that at last their eyes closed from weariness  and they fell fast asleep   when they awoke it was quite dark  and grethel began to cry   how shall we get out of the wood   but hansel tried to comfort her by saying   wait a little while till the moon rises  and then we will quickly find the way    the moon soon shone forth  and hansel  taking his sister s hand  followed the pebbles  which glittered like new coined silver pieces  and showed them the path   all night long they walked on  and as day broke they came to their father s house   they knocked at the door  and when the wife opened it  and saw hansel and grethel  she exclaimed   you wicked children   why did you sleep so long in the wood   we thought you were never coming home again    but their father was very glad  for it had grieved his heart to leave them all alone   not long afterward there was again great scarcity in every corner of the land  and one night the children overheard their mother saying to their father   everything is again consumed  we have only half a loaf left  and then the song is ended  the children must be sent away   we will take them deeper into the wood  so that they may not find the way out again  it is the only means of escape for us    but her husband felt heavy at heart  and thought   it were better to share the last crust with the children    his wife  however  would listen to nothing that he said and scolded and  reproached him without end   he who says a must say b too  and he who consents the first time must also the second   the children  however  had heard the conversation as they lay awake  and as soon as the old people went to sleep hansel got up intending  to pick up some pebbles as before  but the wife had locked the door  so that he could not get out   nevertheless he comforted grethel  saying   do not cry  sleep in quiet  the good god will not forsake us    early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed  and gave them each a slice of bread  which was still smaller than the former piece   on the way hansel broke his in his pocket  and  stopping every now and then  dropped a crumb upon the path    hansel  why do you stop and look about   said the father    keep in the path      i am looking at my little dove   answered hansel   nodding a good by to me     simpleton   said the wife   that is no dove  but only the sun shining on the chimney    so hansel kept still dropping crumbs as he went along   the mother led the children deep into the wood  where they had never been before  and there making an immense fire  she said to them   sit down here and rest  and when you feel tired you can sleep for a little while   we are going into the forest to hew wood  and in the evening  when we are ready  we will come and fetch you    when noon came grethel shared her bread with hansel  who had strewn his on the path   then they went to sleep  but the evening arrived  and no one came to visit the poor children  and in the dark night they awoke  and hansel comforted his sister by saying   only wait  grethel  till the moon comes out  then we shall see the crumbs of bread which i have dropped  and they will show us the way home    the moon shone and they got up  but they could not see any crumbs  for the thousands of birds which had been flying about in the woods and fields had picked them all up   hansel kept saying to grethel   we will soon find the way   but they did not  and they walked the whole night long and the next day  but still they did not come out of the wood  and they got so hungry  for they had nothing to eat but the berries which they found upon the bushes   soon they got so tired that they could not drag themselves along  so they laid down under a tree and went to sleep   it was now the third morning since they had left their father s house  and they still walked on  but they only got deeper and deeper into the wood  and hansel saw that if help did not come very soon they would die of hunger   as soon as it was noon they saw a beautiful snow white bird sitting upon a bough which sang so sweetly that they stood still and listened to it   it soon left off  and spreading its wings  flew off  and they followed it until it arrived at a cottage  upon the roof of which it perched  and when they went close up to it they saw that the cottage was made of bread and cakes  and the windowpanes were of clear sugar    we will go in there   said hansel   and have a glorious feast   i will eat a piece of the roof  and you can eat the window   will they not be sweet    so hansel reached up and broke a piece off the roof  in order to see how it tasted  while grethel stepped up to the window and began to bite it   then a sweet voice called out in the room   tip tap  tip  tap  who raps at my door   and the children answered   the wind  the wind  the child of heaven   and they went on eating without interruption   hansel thought the roof tasted very nice  and so he tore off a great piece  while grethel broke a large round pane out of the window  and sat down quite contentedly   just then the door opened  and a very old woman  walking upon crutches  came out   hansel and grethel were so frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands  but the old woman  nodding her head  said   ah  you dear children  what has brought you here   come in and stop with me  and no harm shall befall you   and so saying she took them both by the hand  and led them into her cottage   a good meal of milk and pancakes  with sugar  apples  and nuts  was spread on the table  and in the back room were two nice little beds  covered with white  where hansel and grethel laid themselves down  and thought themselves in heaven   the old woman had behaved very kindly to them  but in reality she was a wicked witch who waylaid children  and built the bread house in order to entice them in  but as soon as they were in her power she killed them  cooked and ate them  and made a great festival of the day   witches have red eyes  and cannot see very far  but they have a fine sense of smelling  like wild beasts  so that they know when children approach them   when hansel and grethel came near the witch s house she laughed wickedly  saying   here come two who shall not escape me    and early in the morning  before they awoke  she went up to them  and saw how lovingly they lay sleeping  with their chubby red cheeks  and she mumbled to herself   that will be a good bite   then she took up hansel with her rough hand  and shut him up in a little cage with a lattice door  and although he screamed loudly  it was of no use   grethel came next  and  shaking her till she awoke  she said   get up  you lazy thing  and fetch some water to cook something good for your brother  who must remain in that stall and get fat  when he is fat enough i shall  eat him    grethel began to cry  but it was all useless  for the old witch made her do as she wished   so a nice meal was cooked for hansel  but grethel got nothing else but a crab s claw   every morning the old witch came to the cage and said   hansel  stretch your finger that i may feel whether you are getting fat    but hansel used to stretch out a bone  and the old woman  having very bad sight  thought it was his finger  and wondered very much that it did not get fat   when four weeks had passed  and hansel still kept quite lean  she lost all her patience and would not wait any longer    grethel   she called out in a passion   get some water quickly  be hansel fat or lean  this morning i will kill and cook him    oh  how the poor little sister grieved  as she was forced to fetch the water  and how fast the tears ran down her cheeks    dear good god  help us now   she exclaimed    had we only been eaten by the wild beasts in the wood then we should have died together    but the old witch called out   leave off that noise  it will not help you a bit    so early in the morning grethel was forced to go out and fill the kettle  and make a fire    first we will bake  however   said the old woman   i have already heated the oven and kneaded the dough   and so saying she pushed poor grethel up to the oven  out of which the flames were burning fiercely    creep in   said the witch   and see if it is hot enough  and then we will put in the bread   but she intended when grethel got in to shut up the oven and let her bake  so that she might eat her as well as hansel   grethel perceived what her thoughts were  and said   i do not know how to do it  how shall i get in     you stupid goose   said she   the opening is big enough   see  i could even get in myself   and she got up and put her head into the oven   then grethel gave her a push  so that she fell right in  and then shutting the iron door  she bolted it   oh   how horribly she howled  but grethel ran away  and left the ungodly witch to burn to ashes   now she ran to hansel  and  opening his door  called out   hansel  we are saved  the old witch is dead    so he sprang out  like a bird out of his cage when the door is opened  and they were so glad that they fell upon each other s neck  and kissed each other over and over again  and now  as there was nothing to fear  they went into the witch s house  where in every corner were caskets full of pearls and precious stones    these are better than pebbles   said hansel  putting as many into his pocket as it would hold  while grethel thought   i will take some home  too   and filled her apron full    we must be off now   said hansel   and get out of this bewitched forest   but when they had walked for two hours they came to a large piece of water    we cannot get over   said hansel    i can see no bridge at all     and there is no boat either   said grethel   but there swims a white duck  i will ask her to help us over   and she sang    little duck  good little duck   grethel and hansel  here we stand   there is neither stile nor bridge   take us on your back to land    so the duck came to them  and hansel sat himself on  and bade his sister sit behind him    no   answered grethel   that will be too much for the duck  she shall take us over one at a time    this the good little bird did  and when both were happily arrived on the other side  and had gone a little way  they came to a well known wood  which they knew the better every step they went  and at last they perceived their father s house   then they began to run  and  bursting into the house  they fell on their father s neck   he had not had one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest  and his wife was dead   grethel shook her apron  and the pearls and precious stones rolled out upon the floor  and hansel threw down one handful after the other out of his pocket   then all their sorrows were ended  and they lived together in great happiness   my tale is done   there runs a mouse  whoever catches her may make a great  great cap out of her fur   thumbling  by william and jacob grimm  once upon a time there lived a poor peasant  who used to sit every evening by the hearth  poking the fire  while his wife spun   one night he said   how sad it is that we have no children  everything is so quiet here  while in other houses it is so noisy and merry     ah   sighed his wife   if we had but only one  and were he no bigger than my thumb  i should still be content  and love him with all my heart    a little while after the wife fell ill  and after seven months a child was born  who  although he was perfectly formed in all his limbs  was not actually bigger than one s thumb   so they said to one another that it had happened just as they wished  and they called the child  thumbling    every day they gave him all the food he could eat  still he did not grow a bit  but remained exactly the height he was when first born  he looked about him  however  very knowingly  and showed himself to be a bold and clever fellow  who prospered in everything he undertook   one morning the peasant was making ready to go into the forest to fell wood  and said   now i wish i had some one who could follow me with the cart     oh   father   exclaimed thumbling   i will bring the cart  don t you trouble yourself  it shall be there at the right time    the father laughed at this speech  and said   how shall that be   you are much too small to lead the horse by the bridle     that matters not  father   if mother will harness the horse  i can sit in his car  and tell him which way to take     well  we will try for once   said the father  and so  when the hour came  the mother harnessed the horse  and placed thumbling in its ear  and told him how to guide it   then he set out quite like a man  and the cart went on the right road to the forest  and just as it turned a corner  and thumbling called out  steady  steady   two strange men met it  and one said to the other   my goodness  what is this   here comes a cart  and the driver keeps calling to the horse  but i can see no one     that cannot be all right   said the other   let us follow and see where the cart stops    the cart went on safely deep into the forest  and straight to the place where the wood was cut   as soon as thumbling saw his father  he called to him   here  father  here i am  you see  with the cart  just take me down    the peasant caught the bridle of the horse with his left hand  and with his right took his little son out of its ear  and he sat himself down merrily on a straw   when the two strangers saw the little fellow  they knew not what to say for astonishment  and one of them took his companion aside  and said   this little fellow might make our fortune if we could exhibit him in the towns   let us buy him    they went up to the peasant  and asked   will you sell your son   we will treat him well     no   replied the man   he is my heart s delight  and not to be bought for all the money in the world    but thumbling  when he heard what was said  climbed up by his father s skirt  and set himself on his shoulder  and whispered in his ear   let me go now  and i will soon come back again    so his father gave him to the two men for a fine piece of gold  and they asked him where he would sit    oh   replied he   put me on the rim of your hat  and then i can walk round and survey the country   i will not fall off    they did as he wished  and when he had taken leave of his father  they set out   just as it was getting dark he asked to be lifted down  and  after some demur  the man on whose hat he was  took him off and placed him on the ground   in an instant thumbling ran off  and crept into a mousehole  where they could not see him    good evening  masters   said he   you can go home without me   and with a quiet laugh he crept into his hole still further   the two men poked their sticks into the hole  but all in vain  for thumbling only went down further  and when it had grown quite dark they were obliged to return home full of vexation and with empty pockets   as soon as thumbling perceived that they were off  he crawled out of his hiding place  and said   how dangerous it is to walk in this field in the dark  one might soon break one s head or legs   and so saying he looked around  and by great good luck saw an empty snail shell    god be praised   he exclaimed   here i can sleep securely  and in he went  just as he was about to fall asleep he heard two men coming by  one of whom said to the other   how shall we manage to get at the parson s gold and silver     that i can tell you   interrupted thumbling    what was that   exclaimed the thief  frightened    i heard some one speak    they stood still and listened  and then thumbling said   take me with you  and i will help you     where are you   asked the thieves    search on the ground  and mark where my voice comes from   replied he  the thief looked about  and at last found him  and lifted him up in the air    what  will you help us  you little wight   said they    do you not see i can creep between the iron bars into the chamber of the parson  and reach out to you whatever you require     very well  we will see what you can do   said the thief   when they came to the house  thumbling crept into the chamber  and cried out with all his might   will you have all that is here    the thieves were terrified  and said   speak gently  or some one will awake    but thumbling feigned not to understand  and exclaimed  louder still   will you have all that is here    this awoke the cook  who slept in the room  and sitting up in her bed she listened   the thieves  however  had run back a little way  quite frightened  but taking courage again  and thinking the little fellow wished to tease them  they came and whispered to him to make haste and hand them out something   at this  thumbling cried out still more loudly   i will give you it all  only put your hands in    the listening maid heard this clearly  and springing out of bed  hurried out at the door   the thieves ran off as if they were pursued by the wild huntsman  but the maid  as she could see nothing  went to strike a light   when she returned  thumbling escaped without being seen into the barn  and the maid  after she had looked round and searched in every corner  without finding anything  went to bed again  believing she had been dreaming with her eyes open   meanwhile thumbling had crept in amongst the hay  and found a beautiful place to sleep  where he intended to rest till daybreak  and then to go home to his parents   other things however  was he to experience  for there is much tribulation and trouble going on in this world   the maid got up at dawn of day to feed the cow   her first walk was to the barn  where she took an armful of hay  and just the bundle where poor thumbling lay asleep   he slept so soundly  however  that he was not conscious  and only awoke when he was in the cow s mouth    ah  goodness   exclaimed he   however came i into this mill   but soon he saw where he really was   then he took care not to come between the teeth  but presently slipped quite down the cow s throat    there are no windows in this room   said he to himself   and no sunshine  and i brought no light with me    overhead his quarters seemed still worse  and more than all  he felt his room growing narrower  as the cow swallowed more hay   so he began to call out in terror as loudly as he could   bring me no more food   i do not want any more food   just then the maid was milking the cow  and when she heard the voice without seeing anything  and knew it was the same she had listened to in the night  she was so frightened that she slipped off her stool and overturned the milk   in great haste she ran to her master  saying   oh  mr  parson  the cow has been speaking     you are crazy   he replied  but still he went himself into the stable to see what was the matter  and scarcely had he stepped in when thumbling began to shout out again   bring me no more food  bring me no more food    this terrified the parson himself  and he thought an evil spirit had entered into his cow  and so ordered her to be killed   as soon as that was done  and they were dividing the carcass  a fresh accident befell thumbling  for a wolf  who was passing at the time  made a snatch at the cow  and tore away the part where he was stuck fast   however  he did not lose courage  but as soon as the wolf had swallowed him  he called out from inside   oh  mr  wolf  i know of a capital meal for you     where is it to be found   asked the wolf   in the house by the meadow  you must creep through the gutter  and there you will find cakes  and bacon  and sausages  as many as you can eat   replied thumbling  describing exactly his father s house   the wolf did not wait to be told twice  but in the night crept in  and ate away in the larder  to his heart s content   when he had finished  he tried to escape by the way he entered  but the hole was not large enough   thereupon thumbling  who had reckoned on this  began to make a tremendous noise inside the poor wolf  screaming and shouting as loud as he could    will you be quiet   said the wolf   you will awake the people     eh  what   cried the little man   since you have satisfied yourself  it is my turn now to make merry   and he set up a louder howling than before   at last his father and mother awoke  and came to the room and looked through the chinks of the door  and as soon as they perceived the ravages the wolf had committed  they ran and brought the man his ax and the woman the scythe    stop you behind   said the man  as they entered the room   if my blow does not kill him  you must give him a cut with your weapon  and chop off his head if you can    when thumbling heard his father s voice  he called out   father dear  i am here  in the wolf s body     heaven be praised   said the man  full of joy   our dear child is found again   and he bade his wife take away the scythe  lest it should do any harm to his son   then he raised his ax  and gave the wolf such a blow on its head that it fell dead  and  taking a knife  he cut it open and released the little fellow  his son   ah   said his father   what trouble we have had about you     yes  father   replied thumbling   i have been traveling a great deal about the world   heaven be praised   i breathe fresh air again     where have you been  my son   he inquired    once i was in a mouse s hole  once inside a cow  and lastly inside that wolf  and now i will stop here with you   said thumbling    yes   said the old people   we will not sell you again for all the riches of the world   and they embraced and kissed him with great affection   then they gave him plenty to eat and drink  and had new clothes made for him  for his old ones were worn out with traveling   the six swans  by william and jacob grimm  a king was once hunting in a large wood  and pursued his game so hotly  that none of his courtiers could follow him   but when evening approached he stopped  and looking around him perceived that he had lost himself   he sought a path out of the forest  but could not find one  and presently he saw an old woman with a nodding head  who came up to him    my good woman   said he to her   can you not show me the way out of the forest     oh  yes  my lord king   she replied   i can do that very well  but upon one condition  which if you do not fulfill you will never again get out of the wood  but will die of hunger     what  then  is this condition   asked the king    i have a daughter   said the old woman   who is as beautiful as anyone you can find in the whole world  and well deserves to be your bride  now  if you will make her your queen  i will show you your way out of the wood    in the anxiety of his heart the king consented  and the old woman led him to her cottage  where the daughter was sitting by a fire  she received the king as if she had expected him  and he saw at once that she was very beautiful  but yet she did not quite please him  for he could not look at her without a secret shuddering   however  after all  he took the maiden up on his horse  and the old woman showed him the way  and the king arrived safely at his palace  where the wedding was to be celebrated   the king had been married once before  and had seven children by his first wife  six boys and a girl  whom he loved above everything else in the world   he became afraid  soon  that the stepmother might not treat them very well  and might even do them some great injury  so he took them away to a lonely castle which stood in the midst of a forest  this castle was so hidden  and the way to it so difficult to discover  that he himself could not have found it if a wise woman had not given him a ball of cotton which had the wonderful property  when he threw it before him  of unrolling itself and showing him the right path   the king went  however  so often to see his dear children  that the queen noticed his absence  became inquisitive  and wished to know what he went to fetch out of the forest   so she gave his servants a great quantity of money  and they disclosed to her the secret  and also told her of the ball of cotton which alone could show the way   she had now no peace until she discovered where this ball was concealed  and then she made some fine silken shirts  and  as she had learned of her mother  she sewed within each one a charm   one day soon after  when the king was gone out hunting  she took the little shirts and went into the forest  and the cotton showed her the path   the children  seeing some one coming in the distance  thought it was their dear father  and ran out toward her full of joy   then she threw over each of them a shirt  which as it touched their bodies changed them into swans  which flew away over the forest   the queen then went home quite contented  and thought she was free of her stepchildren  but the little girl had not met her with the brothers  and the queen did not know of her   the following day the king went to visit his children  but he found only the maiden    where are your brothers   asked he    ah  dear father   she replied   they are gone away and have left me alone   and she told him how she had looked out of the window and seen them changed into swans  which had flown over the forest  and then she showed him the feathers which they had dropped in the courtyard  and which she had collected together   the king was much grieved  but he did not think that his wife could have done this wicked deed  and  as he feared the girl might also be stolen away  he took her with him   she was  however  so much afraid of the stepmother  that she begged him not to stop more than one night in the castle   the poor maiden thought to herself   this is no longer my place  i will go and seek my brothers   and when night came she escaped and went quite deep into the wood   she walked all night long and great part of the next day  until she could go no further from weariness   just then she saw a rude hut  and walking in she found a room with six little beds  but she dared not get into one  but crept under  and  laying herself upon the hard earth  prepared to pass the night there   just as the sun was setting  she heard a rustling  and saw six white swans come flying in at the window   they settled on the ground and began blowing one another until they had blown all their feathers off  and their swan s down stripped off like a shirt   then the maiden knew them at once for her brothers  and gladly crept out from under the bed  and the brothers were not less glad to see their sister  but their joy was of short duration    here you must not stay   said they to her   this is a robber s hiding place  if they should return and find you here  they will murder you     can you not protect me  then   inquired the sister    no   they replied   for we can only lay aside our swan s feathers for a quarter of an hour each evening  and for that time we retain our human form  but afterward we resume our usual appearance    their sister then asked them with tears   can you not be restored again     oh  no   replied they   the conditions are too difficult   for six long years you must neither speak nor laugh  and during that time you must sew together for us six little shirts of star flowers  and should there fall a single word from your lips  then all your labor will be vain    just as the brother finished speaking  the quarter of an hour elapsed  and they all flew out of the window again like swans   the little sister  however  made a solemn resolution to rescue her brothers or die in the attempt  and she left the cottage  and  penetrating deep into the forest  passed the night amid the branches of a tree   the next morning she went out and collected the star flowers to sew together   she had no one to converse with  and as for laughing she had no spirits  so there up in the tree she sat  intent only upon her work   after she had passed some time there  it happened that the king of that country was hunting in the forest  and his huntsmen came beneath the tree on which the maiden sat   they called to her and asked   who art thou    but she gave no answer    come down to us   continued they   we will do thee no harm    she simply shook her head  and  when they pressed her further with questions  she threw down to them her gold necklace  hoping therewith to satisfy them   they did not  however  leave her  and she threw down her girdle  but in vain  and even her rich dress did not make them desist   at last the hunter himself climbed the tree and brought down the maiden and took her before the king   the king asked her   who art thou   what dost thou upon that tree   but she did not answer  and then he asked her  in all the languages that he knew  but she remained dumb to all  as a fish  since  however  she was so beautiful  the king s heart was touched  and he conceived for her a strong affection   then he put around her his cloak  and  placing her before him on his horse  took her to his castle   there he ordered rich clothing to be made for her  and  although her beauty shone as the sun beams  not a word escaped her  the king placed her by his side at table  and there her dignified mien and manners so won upon him  that he said   this maiden will i to marry  and no other in the world   and after some days he was united to her   now  the king had a wicked stepmother who was discontented with his marriage  and spoke evil of the young queen    who knows whence the wench comes   said she    she who cannot speak is not worthy of a king    a year after  when the queen brought her first born son into the world  the old woman took him away   then she went to the king and complained that the queen was a murderess   the king  however  would not believe it  and suffered no one to do any injury to his wife  who sat composedly sewing at her shirts and paying attention to nothing else   when a second child was born  the false stepmother used the same deceit  but the king again would not listen to her words  but said   she is too pious and good to act so  could she but speak and defend herself  her innocence would come to light    but when again the third time the old woman stole away the child  and then accused the queen  who answered her not a word to the accusation  the king was obliged to give her up to be tried  and she was condemned to suffer death by fire   when the time had elapsed  and the sentence was to be carried out  during which she had neither spoken nor laughed  it was the very day when her dear brothers should be made free  the six shirts were also ready  all but the last  which yet wanted the left sleeve   as she was led to the scaffold she placed the shirts upon her arm  and just as she had mounted it  and the fire was about to be kindled  she looked round  and saw six swans come flying through the air   her heart leaped for joy as she perceived her deliverers approaching  and soon the swans  flying toward her  alighted so near that she was enabled to throw over them the shirts  and as soon as she had so done their feathers fell off and the brothers stood up alive and well  but the youngest wanted his left arm  instead of which he had a swan s wing   they embraced and kissed each other  and the queen going to the king  who was thunderstruck  began to say   now may i speak  my dear husband  and prove to you that i am innocent and falsely accused   and then she told him how the wicked old woman had stolen away and hidden her three children   when she had concluded  the king was overcome with joy  and the wicked stepmother was led to the scaffold and bound to the stake and burned to ashes   the king and the queen forever after lived in peace and prosperity with their six brothers   snow white and rose red  by william and jacob grimm  there was once a poor widow who lived alone in her hut with her two children  who were called snow white and rose red  because they were like the flowers which bloomed on two rosebushes which grew before the cottage   but they were two as pious  good  industrious  and amiable children as any that were in the world  only snow white was more quiet and gentle than rose red   for rose red would run and jump about the meadows  seeking flowers and catching butterflies  while snow white sat at home helping her mother to keep house  or reading to her if there were nothing else to do   the two children loved one another dearly  and always walked hand in hand when they went out together  and ever when they talked of it they agreed that they would never separate from each other  and that whatever one had the other should share   often they ran deep into the forest and gathered wild berries  but no beast ever harmed them   for the hare would eat cauliflowers out of their hands  the fawn would graze at their side  the goats would frisk about them in play  and the birds remained perched on the boughs singing as if nobody were near   no accident ever befell them  and if they stayed late in the forest  and night came upon them  they used to lie down on the moss and sleep till morning  and because their mother knew they would do so  she felt no concern about them   one time when they had thus passed the night in the forest  and the dawn of morning awoke them  they saw a beautiful child dressed in shining white sitting near their couch   she got up and looked at them kindly  but without saying anything went into the forest  and when the children looked round they saw that where they had slept was close to the edge of a pit  into which they would have certainly fallen had they walked a couple of steps further in the dark   their mother told them the figure they had seen was doubtless the good angel who watches over children   snow white and rose red kept their mother s cottage so clean that it was a pleasure to enter it   every morning in the summer time rose red would first put the house in order  and then gather a nosegay for her mother  in which she always placed a bud from each rose tree   every winter s morning snow white would light the fire and put the kettle on to boil  and although the kettle was made of copper it yet shone like gold  because it was scoured so well   in the evenings  when the flakes of snow were falling  the mother would say   go  snow white  and bolt the door   and then they used to sit down on the hearth  and the mother would put on her spectacles and read out of a great book while her children sat spinning   by their side  too  laid a little lamb  and on a perch behind them a little white dove reposed with her head under her wing   one evening  when they were thus sitting comfortably together  there came a knock at the door as if somebody wished to come in    make haste  rose red   cried her mother   make haste and open the door  perhaps there is some traveler outside who needs shelter    so rose red went and drew the bolt and opened the door  expecting to see some poor man outside  but instead  a great fat bear poked his black head in  rose red shrieked out and ran back  the little lamb bleated  the dove fluttered on her perch  and snow white hid herself behind her mother s bed   the bear  however  began to speak  and said   be not afraid  i will do you no harm  but i am half frozen  and wish to come in and warm myself     poor bear   cried the mother   come in and lie down before the fire  but take care you do not burn your skin   and then she continued   come here  rose red and snow white  the bear will not harm you  he means honorably    so they both came back  and by degrees the lamb too and the dove overcame their fears and welcomed the rough visitor    you children   said the bear  before he entered   come and knock the snow off my coat    and they fetched their brooms and swept him clean  then he stretched himself before the fire and grumbled out his satisfaction  and in a little while the children became familiar enough to play tricks with the unwieldy animal   they pulled his long  shaggy skin  set their feet upon his back and rolled him to and fro  and even ventured to beat him with a hazel stick  laughing when he grumbled  the bear bore all their tricks good temperedly  and if they hit him too hard he cried out    leave me my life  you children   snow white and rose red   or you ll never wed    when bedtime came and the others were gone  the mother said to the bear   you may sleep here on the hearth if you like  and then you will be safely protected from the cold and bad weather    as soon as day broke the two children let the bear out again  and he trotted away over the snow  and ever afterward he came every evening at a certain hour   he would lie down on the hearth and allow the children to play with him as much as they liked  till by degrees they became so accustomed to him that the door was left unbolted till their black friend arrived   but as soon as spring returned  and everything out of doors was green again  the bear one morning told snow white that he must leave her  and could not return during the whole summer    where are you going  then  dear bear   asked snow white   i am obliged to go into the forest and guard my treasures from the evil dwarfs  for in winter  when the ground is hard  they are obliged to keep in their holes  and cannot work through  but now  since the sun has thawed the earth and warmed it  the dwarf s pierce through  and steal all they can find  and what has once passed into their hands  and gets concealed by them in their caves  is not easily brought to light    snow white  however  was very sad at the departure of the bear  and opened the door so hesitatingly that when he pressed through it he left behind on the sneck a piece of his hairy coat  and through the hole which was made in his coat snow white fancied she saw the glittering of gold  but she was not quite certain of it   the bear  however  ran hastily away  and was soon hidden behind the trees   some time afterward the mother sent the children into the wood to gather sticks  and while doing so  they came to a tree which was lying across the path  on the trunk of which something kept bobbing up and down from the grass  and they could not imagine what it was   when they came nearer they saw a dwarf  with an old wrinkled face and a snow  white beard a yard long   the end of this beard was fixed in a split of the tree  and the little man kept jumping about like a dog tied by a chain  for he did not know how to free himself   he glared at the maidens with his red fiery eyes  and exclaimed   why do you stand there   are you going to pass without offering me any assistance    what have you done  little man   asked rose red    you stupid  gaping goose   exclaimed he    i wanted to have split the tree  in order to get a little wood for my kitchen  for the little wood which we use is soon burned up with great fagots  not like what you rough  greedy people devour   i had driven the wedge in properly  and everything was going on well  when the smooth wood flew upward  and the tree closed so suddenly together that i could not draw my beautiful beard out  and here it sticks and i cannot get away   there  don t laugh  you milk  faced things   are you dumfounded    the children took all the pains they could to pull the dwarf s beard out  but without success    i will run and fetch some help   cried rose red at length    crack brained sheep s head that you are   snarled the dwarf   what are you going to call other people for   you are two too many now for me  can you think of nothing else     don t be impatient   replied snow white   i have thought of something   and pulling her scissors out of her pocket she cut off the end of the beard   as soon as the dwarf found himself at liberty  he snatched up his sack  which lay between the roots of the tree  filled with gold  and throwing it over his shoulder marched off  grumbling and groaning and crying   stupid people   to cut off a piece of my beautiful beard   plague take you   and away he went without once looking at the children   some time afterward snow white and rose red went a fishing  and as they neared the pond they saw something like a great locust hopping about on the bank  as if going to jump into the water   they ran up and recognized the dwarf    what are you after   asked rose red   you will fall into the water     i am not quite such a simpleton as that   replied the dwarf   but do you not see this fish will pull me in    the little man had been sitting there angling  and unfortunately the wind had entangled his beard with the fishing line  and so  when a great fish bit at the bait  the strength of the weak little fellow was not able to draw it out  and the fish had the best of the struggle   the dwarf held on by the reeds and rushes which grew near  but to no purpose  for the fish pulled him where it liked  and he must soon have been drawn into the pond   luckily just then the two maidens arrived  and tried to release the beard of the dwarf from the fishing line  but both were too closely entangled for it to be done   so the maiden pulled out her scissors again and cut off another piece of the beard  when the dwarf saw this done he was in a great rage  and exclaimed   you donkey   that is the way to disfigure my face   was it not enough to cut it once  but you must now take away the best part of my fine beard   i dare not show myself again now to my own people   i wish you had run the soles off your boots before you had come here    so saying  he took up a bag of pearls which lay among the rushes  and without speaking another word  slipped off and disappeared behind a stone   not many days after this adventure  it chanced that the mother sent the two maidens to the next town to buy thread  needles and pins  laces and ribbons   their road passed over a common  on which here and there great pieces of rock were lying about   just over their heads they saw a great bird flying round and round  and every now and then  dropping lower and lower  till at last it flew down behind a rock   immediately afterward they heard a piercing shriek  and running up they saw with affright that the eagle had caught their old acquaintance   the dwarf  and was trying to carry him off   the compassionate children thereupon laid hold of the little man  and held him fast till the bird gave up the struggle and flew off   as soon then as the dwarf had recovered from his fright  he exclaimed in his squeaking voice   could you not hold me more gently   you have seized my fine brown coat in such a manner that it is all torn and full of holes  meddling and interfering rubbish that you are    with these words he shouldered a bag filled with precious stones  and slipped away to his cave among the rocks   the maidens were now accustomed to his ingratitude  and so they walked on to the town and transacted their business there   coming home  they returned over the same common  and unawares walked up to a certain clean spot on which the dwarf had shaken out his bag of precious stones  thinking nobody was near   the sun was shining  and the bright stones glittered in its beams and displayed such a variety of colors that the two maidens stopped to admire them    what are you standing there gaping for   asked the dwarf  while his face grew as red as copper with rage  he was continuing to abuse the poor maidens  when a loud roaring noise was heard  and presently a great black bear came rolling out of the forest   the dwarf jumped up terrified  but he could not gain his retreat before the bear overtook him   thereupon  he cried out   spare me  my dear lord bear   i will give you all my treasures   see these beautiful precious stones which lie here  only give me my life  for what have you to fear from a little weak fellow like me   you could not touch me with your big teeth  there are two wicked girls  take them  they would make nice morsels  as fat as young quails  eat them for heaven s sake    the bear  however  without troubling himself to speak  gave the bad  hearted dwarf a single blow with his paw  and he never stirred after   the maidens were then going to run away  but the bear called after them   snow white and rose red  fear not   wait a bit and i will accompany you    they recognized his voice and stopped  and when the bear came  his rough coat suddenly fell off  and he stood up a tall man  dressed entirely in gold    i am a king s son   he said   and was condemned by the wicked dwarf  who stole all my treasures  to wander about in this forest  in the form of a bear  till his death released me   now he has received his well deserved punishment    then they went home  and snow white was married to the prince  and rose red to his brother  with whom they shared the immense treasure which the dwarf had collected   the old mother also lived for many years happily with her two children  and the rose trees which had stood before the cottage were planted now before the palace  and produced every year beautiful red and white roses   the ugly duckling  by hans christian andersen  it was so glorious out in the country  it was summer  the cornfields were yellow  the oats were green  the hay had been put up in stacks in the green meadows  and the stork went about on his long red legs  and chattered egyptian  for this was the language he had learned from his good mother   all around the fields and meadows were great forests  and in the midst of these forests lay deep lakes   yes  it was right glorious out in the country   in the midst of the sunshine there lay an old farm  with deep canals about it  and from the wall down to the water grew great burdocks  so high that little children could stand upright under the loftiest of them   it was just as wild there as in the deepest wood  and here sat a duck upon her nest  she had to hatch her ducklings  but she was almost tired out before the little ones came  and then she so seldom had visitors   the other ducks liked better to swim about in the canals than to run up to sit down under a burdock  and cackle with her   at last one egg shell after another burst open    piep   piep   it cried  and in all the eggs there were little creatures that stuck out their heads    quack   quack   they said  and they all came quacking out as fast as they could  looking all round them under the green leaves  and the mother let them look as much as they chose  for green is good for the eye    how wide the world is   said all the young ones  for they certainly had much more room now than when they were in the eggs    d ye think this is all the world   said the mother    that stretches far across the other side of the garden  quite into the parson s field  but i have never been there yet   i hope you are all together   and she stood up    no  i have not all   the largest egg still lies there   how long is that to last   i am really tired of it   and she sat down again    well  how goes it   asked an old duck who had come to pay her a visit    it lasts a long time with that one egg   said the duck who sat there   it will not burst   now  only look at the others  are they not the prettiest little ducks one could possibly see   they are all like their father  the rogue  he never comes to see me     let me see the egg which will not burst   said the old visitor    you may be sure it is a turkey s egg   i was once cheated in that way  and had much anxiety and trouble with the young ones  for they are afraid of the water   must i say it to you  i could not get them to venture in   i quacked and i clacked  but it was no use   let me see the egg  yes  that s a turkey s egg   let it lie there  and teach the other children to swim     i think i will sit on it a little longer   said the duck    i ve sat so long now that i can sit a few days more     just as you please   said the old duck  and she went away   at last the great egg burst    piep   piep   said the little one  and crept forth  it was very large and very ugly   the duck looked at it    it s a very large duckling   said she   none of the others look like that  can it really be a turkey chick   well  we shall soon find out  it must go into the water  even if i have to thrust it in myself    the next day  it was bright  beautiful weather  the sun shone on all the green trees   the mother duck went down to the canal with all her family   splash   she jumped into the water    quack   quack   she said  and one duckling after another plunged in   the water closed over their heads  but they came up in an instant  and swam capitally  their legs went of themselves  and they were all in the water   the ugly gray duckling swam with them    no  it s not a turkey   said she   look how well it can use its legs  and how straight it holds itself   it is my own child   on the whole it s quite pretty  if one looks at it rightly   quack   quack   come with me  and i ll lead you out into the great world  and present you in the duckyard  but keep close to me  so that no one may tread on you  and take care of the cats    and so they came into the duckyard   there was a terrible riot  going on in there  for two families were quarreling about an eel s head  and the cat got it after all    see  that s how it goes in the world   said the mother duck  and she whetted her beak  for she too wanted the eel s head    only use your legs   she said    see that you can bustle about  and bow your heads before the old duck yonder   she s the grandest of all here  she s of spanish blood that s why she s so fat  and d ye see she has a red rag round her leg  that s something particularly fine  and the greatest distinction a duck can enjoy  it signifies that one does not want to lose her  and that she s to be known by the animals and by men too  shake yourselves don t turn in your toes  a well brought up duck turns its toes quite out  just like father and mother so   now bend your necks and say  quack     and they did so  but the other ducks round about looked at them  and said quite boldly    look there   now we re to have these hanging on  as if there were not enough of us already  and  fie  how that duckling yonder looks  we won t stand that    and one duck flew up at it  and bit it in the neck    let it alone   said the mother   it does no harm to anyone     yes  but it s too large and peculiar   said the duck who had bitten it   and therefore it must be put down     those are pretty children that the mother has there   said the old duck with the rag round her leg   they re all pretty but that one  that was rather unlucky   i wish she could bear it over again     that cannot be done  my lady   replied the mother duck    it is not pretty  but it has a really good disposition  and swims as well as any other  yes  i may even say it  swims better   i think it will grow up pretty  and become smaller in time  it has lain too long in the egg  and therefore is not properly shaped    and then she pinched it in the neck  and smoothed its feathers   moreover it is a drake   she said   and therefore it is not so much consequence   i think he will be very strong  he makes his way already     the other duckling s are graceful enough   said the old duck    make yourself at home  and if you find an eel s head  you may bring it to me    and now they were at home   but the poor duckling which had crept last out of the egg  and looked so ugly  was bitten and pushed and jeered  as much by the ducks as by the chickens    it is too big   they all said   and the turkey cock  who had been born with spurs  and therefore thought himself an emperor  blew himself up like a ship in full sail  and bore straight down upon it  then he gobbled and grew quite red in the face   the poor duckling did not know where it should stand or walk  it was quite melancholy because it looked ugly  and was the butt of the whole duckyard   so it went on the first day  and afterward it became worse and worse  the poor duckling was hunted about by everyone  even its brothers and sisters were quite angry with it  and said   if the cat would only catch you  you ugly creature    and the mother said   if you were only far away    and the ducks hit it  and the chickens beat it  and the girl who had to feed the poultry kicked at it with her foot   then it ran and flew over the fence  and the little birds in the bushes flew up in fear    that is because i am so ugly   thought the duckling  and it shut its eyes  but flew on further  and so it came out into the great moor  where the wild ducks lived   here it lay the whole night long  and it was weary and downcast   toward morning the wild chicks flew up  and looked at their new companion    what sort of a one are you   they asked  and the duckling turned in every direction  and bowed as well as it could   you are remarkably ugly   said the wild ducks    but that is nothing to us  so long as you do not marry into our family    poor thing   it certainly did not think of marrying  and only hoped to obtain leave to lie among the reeds and drink some of the swamp water   thus it lay two whole days  then came thither two wild geese  or  properly speaking  two wild ganders   it was not long since each had crept out of an egg  and that s why they were so saucy    listen  comrade   said one of them    you re so ugly that i like you  will you go with us  and become a bird of passage   near here  in another moor  there are a few sweet lovely geese  all unmarried  and all able to say  rap    you ve a chance of  making your fortune  ugly as you are     piff   paff   resounded through the air  and the two ganders fell down dead in the swamp  and the water became blood red    piff paff   it sounded again  and the whole flock of wild geese rose up from the reeds   and then there was another report   a great hunt was going on  the sportsmen were lying in wait all round the moor  and some were even sitting up in the branches of the trees  which spread far over the reeds   the blue smoke rose up like clouds among the dark trees  and was wafted far away across the water  and the hunting dogs came splash  splash  into the swamp  and the rushes and the reeds bent down on every side   that was a fright for the poor duckling   it turned its head  and put it under its wing  but at that moment a frightful great dog stood close by the duckling   his tongue hung far out of his mouth  and his eyes gleamed horrible and ugly  he thrust out his nose close against the duckling  showed his sharp teeth  and splash  splash  on he went  without seizing it    o  heaven be thanked   sighed the duckling    i am so ugly  that even the dog does not like to bite me    and so it lay quite quiet  while the shots rattled through the reeds and gun after gun was fired   at last  late in the day  all was still  but the poor duckling did not dare to rise up  it waited several hours before it looked round  and then hastened away out of the moor as fast it could   it ran on over field and meadow  there was such a storm raging that it was difficult to get from one place to another   toward evening the duck came to a little miserable peasant s hut   this hut was so dilapidated that it did not itself know on which side it should fall  and that s why it remained standing   the storm whistled round the duckling in such a way that the poor creature was obliged to sit down  to stand against it  and the wind blew worse and worse   then the duckling noticed that one of the hinges of the door had given way  and the door hung so slanting that the duckling could slip through the crack into the room  and that is what it did   here lived a woman  with her cat and her hen   and the cat  whom she called sonnie  could arch his back and purr  he could even give out sparks  but for that one had to stroke his fur the wrong way   the hen had quite little short legs  and therefore she was called chickabiddy shortshanks  she laid good eggs  and the woman loved her as her own child   in the morning the strange duckling was at once noticed  and the cat began to purr and the hen to cluck    what s this   said the woman  and looked all round  but she could not see well  and therefore she thought the duckling was a fat duck that had strayed    this is a rare prize   she said   now i shall have ducks  eggs   i hope it is not a drake   we must try that    and so the duckling was admitted on trial for three weeks  but no eggs came   and the cat was master of the house  and the hen was the lady  and always said  we and the world   for she thought they were half the world  and by far the better half   the duckling thought one might have a different opinion  but the hen would not allow it    can you lay eggs   she asked    no     then will you hold your tongue    and the cat said   can you curve your back  and purr  and give out sparks     no     then you will please have no opinion of your own when sensible folks are speaking   and the duckling sat in a corner and was melancholy  then the fresh air and the sunshine streamed in  and it was seized with such a strange longing to swim on the water  that it could not help telling the hen of it    what are you thinking of   cried the hen    you have nothing to do  that s why you have these fancies   lay eggs  or purr  and they will pass over     but it is so charming to swim on the water   said the duckling   so refreshing to let it close over one s head  and to dive down to the bottom     yes  that must be a mighty pleasure  truly   quoth the hen    i fancy you must have gone crazy   ask the cat about it he s the cleverest animal i know ask him if he likes to swim on the water  or to dive down  i won t speak about myself   ask our mistress  the old woman  no one in the world is cleverer than she   do you think she has any desire to swim  and to let the water close above her head     you don t understand me   said the duckling    we don t understand you   then pray who is to understand you   you surely don t pretend to be cleverer than the cat and the woman i won t say anything of myself   don t be conceited  child  and thank your maker for all the kindness you have received   did you not get into a warm room  and have you not fallen into company from which you may learn something   but you are a chatterer  and it is not pleasant to associate with you   you may believe me  i speak for your good   i tell you disagreeable things  and by that one may always know one s true friends   only take care that you learn to lay eggs  or to purr  and give out sparks     i think i will go out into the wide world   said the duckling    yes  do go   replied the hen   and so the duckling went away   it swam on the water  and dived  but it was slighted by every creature because of its ugliness   now came the autumn   the leaves in the forest turned yellow and brown  the wind caught them so that they danced about  and up in the air it was very cold   the clouds hung low  heavy with hail and snowflakes  and on the fence stood the raven  crying   croak   croak   for mere cold  yes  it was enough to make one feel cold to think of this   the poor little duckling certainly had not a good time   one evening the sun was just setting in his beauty there came a whole flock of great  handsome birds out of the bushes  they were dazzlingly white  with long  flexible necks  they were swans   they uttered a very peculiar cry  spread forth their glorious great wings  and flew away from that cold region to warmer lands  to fair open lakes   they mounted so high  so high   and the ugly duckling felt quite strangely as it watched them   it turned round and round in the water like a wheel  stretched out its neck toward them  and uttered such a strange  loud cry as frightened itself   oh   it could not forget those beautiful  happy birds  and so soon as it could see them no longer  it dived down to the very bottom  and when it came up again  it was quite beside itself   it knew not the name of those birds  and knew not whither they were flying  but it loved them more than it had ever loved anyone   it was not at all envious of them   how could it think of wishing to possess such loveliness as they had   it would have been glad if only the ducks would have endured its company the poor  ugly creature   and the winter grew cold  very cold   the duckling was forced to swim about in the water  to prevent the surface from freezing entirely  but every night the hole in which it swam about became smaller and smaller  it froze so hard that the icy covering crackled again  and the duckling was obliged to use its legs continually to prevent the hole from freezing up   at last it became exhausted  and lay quite still  and thus froze fast into the ice   early in the morning a peasant came by  and when he saw what had happened  he took his wooden shoe  broke the ice crust to pieces  and carried the duckling home to his wife   then it came to itself again   the children wanted to play with it  but the duckling thought they wanted to hurt it  and in its terror fluttered up into the milk pan  so that the milk spurted down into the room   the woman clasped her hands  at which the duckling flew down into the butter tub  and then into the meal barrel and out again   how it looked then   the woman screamed  and struck at it with the fire tongs  the children tumbled over one another in their efforts to catch the duckling  and they laughed and they screamed  well it was that the door stood open  and the poor creature was able to slip out between the shrubs into the newly fallen snow there it lay quite exhausted   but it would be too melancholy if i were to tell all the misery and care which the duckling had to endure in the hard winter   it lay out on the moor among the reeds  when the sun began to shine again and the larks to sing  it was a beautiful spring   then all at once the duckling could flap its wings  they beat the air more strongly than before  and bore it strongly away  and before it well knew how all this happened  it found itself in a great garden  where the elder trees smelled sweet  and bent their long green branches down to the canal that wound through the region   oh  here it was so beautiful  such a gladness of spring   and from the thicket came three glorious white swans  they rustled their wings  and swam lightly on the water   the duckling knew the splendid creatures  and felt oppressed by a peculiar sadness    i will fly away to them  to the royal birds   and they will beat me  because i  that am so ugly  dare to come near them   but it is all the same   better to be killed by them than to be pursued by ducks  and beaten by fowls  and pushed about by the girl who takes care of the poultry yard  and to suffer hunger in winter    and it flew out into the water  and swam toward the beautiful swans  these looked at it  and came sailing down upon it with outspread wings    kill me   said the poor creature  and bent its head down upon the water  expecting nothing but death   but what was this that it saw in the clear water   it beheld its own image  and  lo   it was no longer a clumsy  dark gray bird  ugly and hateful to look at  but a swan   it matters nothing if one is born in a duck yard  if one has only lain in a swan s egg   it felt quite glad at all the need and misfortune it had suffered  now it realized its happiness in all the splendor that surrounded it   and the great swans swam round it  and stroked it with their beaks   into the garden came little children  who threw bread and corn into the water  and the youngest cried   there is a new one   and the other children shouted joyously   yes  a new one has arrived    and they clapped their hands and danced about  and ran to their father and mother  and bread and cake were thrown into the water  and they all said   the new one is the most beautiful of all so young and handsome   and the old swans bowed their heads before him   then he felt quite ashamed  and hid his head under his wings  for he did not know what to do  he was so happy  and yet not at all proud   he thought how he had been persecuted and despised  and now he heard them saying that he was the most beautiful of all birds   even the elder tree bent its branches straight down into the water before him  and the sun shone warm and mild   then his wings rustled  he lifted his slender neck  and cried rejoicingly from the depths of his heart    i never dreamed of so much happiness when i was the ugly duckling    the tinder box  by hans christian andersen  there came a soldier marching along the high road one  two   one  two  he had his knapsack on his back and a saber by his side  for he had been in the wars  and now he wanted to go home   and on the way he met with an old witch  she was very hideous and her under lip hung down upon her breast   she said   good evening  soldier   what a fine sword you have  and what a big knapsack   you re a proper soldier   now you shall have as much money as you like to have     i thank you  you old witch  said the soldier    do you see that great tree   quoth the witch  and she pointed to a tree which stood beside them    it s quite hollow inside   you must climb to the top  and then you ll see a hole  through which you can let yourself down and get deep into the tree   i ll tie a rope round your body  so that i can pull you up again when you call me     what am i to do down in the tree   asked the soldier    get money   replied the witch    listen to me   when you come down to the earth under the tree  you will find yourself in a great hall  it is quite light  for above three hundred lamps are burning there   then you will see three doors  these you can open  for the keys are hanging there   if you go into the first chamber  you ll see a great chest in the middle of the floor  on this chest sits a dog  and he s got a pair of eyes as big as two teacups   but you need not care for that   i ll give you my blue checked apron  and you can spread it out upon the floor  then go up quickly and take the dog  and set him on my apron  then open the chest  and take as many shillings as you like   they are of copper  if you prefer silver  you must go into the second chamber  but there sits a dog with a pair of eyes as big as mill wheels   but do not you care for that   set him upon my apron  and take some of the money   and if you want gold  you can have that too in fact  as much as you can carry if you go into the third chamber   but the dog that sits on the money chest there has two eyes as big as round towers   he is a fierce dog  you may be sure  but you needn t be afraid  for all that  only set him on my apron  and he won t hurt you  and take out of the chest as much gold as you like     that s not so bad   said the soldier    but what am i to give you  you old witch   for you will not do it for nothing  i fancy     no   replied the witch   not a single shilling will i have   you shall only bring me an old tinder box which my grandmother forgot when she was down there last     then tie the rope round my body   cried the soldier    here it is   said the witch   and here s my blue checked apron    then the soldier climbed up into the tree  let himself slip down into the hole  and stood  as the witch had said  in the great hall where the three hundred lamps were burning   now he opened the first door   ugh   there sat the dog with eyes as big as teacups  staring at him    you re a nice fellow   exclaimed the soldier  and he set him on the witch s apron  and took as many shillings as his pockets would hold  and then locked the chest  set the dog on it again  and went into the second chamber  aha   there sat the dog with eyes as big as mill wheels    you should not stare so hard at me   said the soldier   you might strain your eyes   and he set the dog upon the witch s apron   and when he saw the silver money in the chest  he threw away all the copper money he had and filled his pockets and his knapsack with silver only  then he went into the third chamber   oh  but that was horrid   the dog there really had eyes as big as towers  and they turned round and round in his head like wheels    good evening   said the soldier  and he touched his cap  for he had never seen such a dog as that before   when he had looked at him a little more closely  he thought   that will do   and lifted him down to the floor  and opened the chest   mercy   what a quantity of gold was there   he could buy with it the whole town  and the sugar sucking pigs of the cake woman  and all the tin soldiers  whips  and rocking horses in the whole world   yes  that was a quantity of money   now the soldier threw away all the silver coin with which he had filled his pockets and his knapsack  and took gold instead  yes  all his pockets  his knapsack  his boots  and his cap were filled  so that he could scarcely walk   now indeed he had plenty of money   he put the dog on the chest shut the door  and then called up through the tree   now pull me up  you old witch     have you the tinder box   asked the witch    plague on it   exclaimed the soldier   i had clean forgotten that   and he went and brought it   the witch drew him up  and he stood on the high road again  with pockets  boots  knapsack  and cap full of gold    what are you going to do with the tinder box   asked the soldier    that s nothing to you   retorted the witch    you ve had your money  just give me the tinder box     nonsense   said the soldier    tell me directly what you re going to do with it or i ll draw my sword and cut off your head     no   cried the witch   so the soldier cut off her head   there she lay   but he tied up all his money in her apron  took it on his back like a bundle  put the tinder box in his pocket  and went straight off toward the town   that was a splendid town   and he put up at the very best inn  and asked for the finest rooms  and ordered his favorite dishes  for now he was rich  as he had so much money   the servant who had to clean his boots certainly thought them a remarkably old pair for such a rich gentleman  but he had not bought any new ones yet   the next day he procured proper boots and handsome clothes   now our soldier had become a fine gentleman  and the people told him of all the splendid things which were in their city  and about the king  and what a pretty princess the king s daughter was    where can one get to see her   asked the soldier    she is not to be seen at all   said they all together   she lives in a great copper castle  with a great many walls and towers round about it  no one but the king may go in and out there  for it has been prophesied that she shall marry a common soldier  and the king can t bear that     i should like to see her   thought the soldier  but he could not get leave to do so   now he lived merrily  went to the theater  drove in the king s garden  and gave much money to the poor  and this was very kind of him  for he knew from old times how hard it is when one has not a shilling   now he was rich  had new clothes  and gained many friends  who all said he was a rare one  a true cavalier  and that pleased the soldier well  but as he spent money every day and never carried any  he had at last only two shillings left  and he was obliged to turn out of the fine rooms in which he had dwelt  and had to live in a little garret under the roof  and clean his boots for himself  and mend them with a darning needle   none of his friends came to see him  for there were too many stairs to climb   it was quite dark one evening  and he could not even buy himself a candle  when it occurred to him that there was a candle end in the tinder box which he had taken out of the hollow tree into which the witch had helped him   he brought out the tinder box and the candle end  but as soon as he struck fire and the sparks rose up from the flint  the door flew open  and the dog who had eyes as big as a couple of teacups  and whom he had seen in the tree  stood before him  and said    what are my lord s commands     what is this   said the soldier    that s a famous tinder box  if i can get everything with it that i want   bring me some money   said he to the dog  and whisk   the dog was gone  and whisk   he was back again  with a great bag full of shillings in his mouth   now the soldier knew what a capital tinder box this was   if he struck it once  the dog came who sat upon the chest of copper money  if he struck it twice  the dog came who had the silver  and if he struck it three times  then appeared the dog who had the gold   now the soldier moved back into the fine rooms  and appeared again in handsome clothes  and all his friends knew him again  and cared very much for him indeed   once he thought to himself   it is a very strange thing that one cannot get to see the princess   they all say she is very beautiful  but what is the use of that  if she has always to sit in the great copper castle with the many towers   can i not get to see her at all   where is my tinder box   and so he struck a light  and whisk   came the dog with eyes as big as teacups    it is midnight  certainly   said the soldier   but i should very much like to see the princess  only for one little moment    and the dog was outside the door directly  and  before the soldier thought it  came back with the princess   she sat upon the dogs back and slept  and everyone could see she was a real princess  for she was so lovely   the soldier could not refrain from kissing her  for he was a thorough soldier   then the dog ran back again with the princess  but when morning came  and the king and queen were drinking tea  the princess said she had had a strange dream the night before about a dog and a soldier that she had ridden upon the dog  and the soldier had kissed her    that would be a fine history   said the queen   so one of the old court ladies had to watch the next night by the princess s bed  to see if this was really a dream  or what it might be   the soldier had a great longing to see the lovely princess again  so the dog came in the night  took her away  and ran as fast as he could  but the old lady put on water boots  and ran just as fast after him  when she saw that they both entered a great house  she thought   now i know where it is  and with a bit of chalk she drew a great cross on the door   then she went home and lay down  and the dog came up with the princess  but when he saw that there was a cross drawn on the door where the soldier lived  he took a piece of chalk too  and drew crosses on all the doors in the town   and that was cleverly done  for now the lady could not find the right door  because all the doors had crosses upon them   in the morning early came the king and queen  the old court lady and all the officers  to see where it was the princess had been    here it is   said the king  when he saw the first door with a cross upon it   no  my dear husband  it is there   said the queen  who descried another door which also showed a cross    but there is one  and there is one   said all  for wherever they looked there were crosses on the doors   so they saw that it would avail them nothing if they searched on   but the queen was an exceedingly clever woman  who could do more than ride in a coach   she took her great gold scissors  cut a piece of silk into pieces  and made a neat little bag  this bag she filled with fine wheat flour  and tied it on the princess s back  and when that was done  she cut a little hole in the bag  so that the flour would be scattered along all the way which the princess should take   in the night the dog came again  took the princess on his back  and ran with her to the soldier  who loved her very much  and would gladly have been a prince  so that he might have her for his wife   the dog did not notice at all how the flour ran out in a stream from the castle to the windows of the soldier s house  where he ran up the wall with the princess   in the morning the king and queen saw well enough where their daughter had been  and they took the soldier and put him in prison   there he sat   oh  but it was dark and disagreeable there   and they said to him   to morrow you shall be hanged    that was not amusing to hear  and he had left his tinder box at the inn   in the morning he could see  through the iron grating of the little window  how the people were hurrying out of the town to see him hanged   he heard the drums beat and saw the soldiers marching   all the people were running out  and among them was the shoemaker s boy with leather apron and slippers  and he galloped so fast that one of his slippers flew off  and came right against the wall where the soldier sat looking through the iron grating    halloo  you shoemaker s boy   you needn t be in such a hurry   cried the soldier to him   it will not begin till i come   but if you will run to where i lived and bring me my tinder box  you shall have four shillings  but you must put your best leg foremost    the shoemaker s boy wanted to get the four shillings  so he went and brought the tinder box  and well  we shall hear now what happened   outside the town a great gallows had been built  and round it stood the soldiers and many hundred thousand people   the king and queen sat on a splendid throne  opposite to the judges and the whole council   the soldiers already stood upon the ladder  but as they were about to put the rope round his neck  he said that before a poor criminal suffered his punishment an innocent request was always granted to him   he wanted very much to smoke a pipe of tobacco  and it would be the last pipe he should smoke in the world   the king would not say  no  to this  so the soldier took his tinder box and struck fire   one two  three    and there suddenly stood all the dogs the one with eyes as big as teacups  the one with eyes as large as mill wheels  and the one whose eyes were as big as round towers    help me now  so that i may not be hanged   said the soldier   and the dogs fell upon the judges and all the council  seized one by the leg and another by the nose  and tossed them many feet into the air  so that they fell down and were all broken to pieces    i won t   cried the king  but the biggest dog took him and the queen  and threw them after the others   then the soldiers were afraid  and the people cried   little soldier  you shall be our king  and marry the beautiful princess    so they put the soldier into the king s coach  and all the three dogs darted on in front and cried  hurrah   and the boys whistled through their fingers  and the soldiers presented arms   the princess came out of the copper castle  and became queen  and she liked that well enough  the wedding lasted a week  and the three dogs sat at the table too  and opened their eyes wider than ever at all they saw   the constant tin soldier  by hans christian andersen  there were once five and twenty tin soldiers  they were all brothers  for they had all been born of one old tin spoon   they shouldered their muskets  and looked straight before them  their uniform was red and blue  and very splendid   the first thing they had heard in the world  when the lid was taken off the box  had been the words  tin soldiers   these words were tittered by a little boy  clapping his hands  the soldiers had been given to him  for it was his birthday  and now he put them upon the table   each soldier was exactly like the rest  but one of them had been cast last of all  and there had not been enough tin to finish him  but he stood as firmly upon his one leg as the others on their two  and it was just this soldier who became remarkable   on the table on which they had been placed stood many other playthings  but the toy that attracted most attention was a neat castle of cardboard   through the little windows one could see straight into the hall   before the castle some little trees were placed round a little looking glass  which was to represent a clear lake   waxen swans swam on this lake  and were mirrored in it   this was all very pretty  but the prettiest of all was a little lady  who stood at the open door of the castle  she was also cut out in paper  but she had a dress of the clearest gauze  and a little narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders that looked like a scarf  and in the middle of this ribbon was a shining tinsel rose  as big as her whole face   the little lady stretched out both her arms  for she was a dancer  and then she lifted one leg so high that the tin soldier could not see it at all  and thought that  like himself  she had but one leg    that would be the wife for me   thought he   but she is very grand  she lives in a castle  and i have only a box  and there are five and  twenty of us in that   it is no place for her   but i must try to make acquaintance with her    and then he lay down at full length behind a snuffbox which was on the table  there he could easily watch the little dainty lady  who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance   when the evening came  all the other tin soldiers were put into their box  and the people in the house went to bed   now the toys began to play at  visiting   and at  war   and  giving balls    the tin soldiers rattled in their box  for they wanted to join  but could not lift the lid   the nutcracker threw somersaults  and the pencil amused itself on the table  there was so much noise that the canary woke up  and began to speak too  and even in verse   the only two who did not stir from their places were the tin soldier and the dancing lady  she stood straight up on the point of one of her toes  and stretched out both her arms  and he was just as enduring on his one leg  and he never turned his eyes away from her   now the clock struck twelve and  bounce   the lid flew off the snuffbox  but there was not snuff in it  but a little black goblin  you see  it was a trick    tin soldier   said the goblin   don t stare at things that don t concern you    but the tin soldier pretended not to hear him    just you wait till to  morrow   said the goblin   but when the morning came  and the children got up  the tin soldier was placed in the window  and whether it was the goblin or the draft that did it  all at once the window flew open  and the soldier fell  head over heels  out of the third story   that was a terrible passage   he put his leg straight up  and struck with his helmet downward  and his bayonet between the paving stones   the servant maid and the little boy came down directly to look for him  but though they almost trod upon him they could not see him   if the soldier had cried out   here i am   they would have found him  but he did not think it fitting to call out loudly  because he was in uniform   now it began to rain  the drops soon fell thicker  and at last it came down in a complete stream   when the rain was past  two street boys came by    just look   said one of them   there lies a tin soldier   he must come out and ride in the boat    and they made a boat out of a newspaper  and put the tin soldier in the middle of it  and so he sailed down the gutter  and the two boys ran beside him and clapped their hands   goodness preserve us   how the waves rose in that gutter  and how fast the stream ran   but then it had been a heavy rain   the paper boat rocked up and down  and sometimes turned round so rapidly that the tin soldier trembled  but he remained firm and never changed countenance  and looked straight before him  and shouldered his musket   all at once the boat went into a long drain  and it became as dark as if he had been in his box    where am i going now   he thought    yes  yes  that s the goblin s fault   ah  if the little lady only sat here with me in the boat  it might be twice as dark for what i should care    suddenly there came a great water rat  which lived under the drain    have you a passport   said the rat    give me your passport    but the tin soldier kept silence  and only held his musket tighter than ever   the boat went on  but the rat came after it   hu  how he gnashed his teeth  and called out to the bits of straw and wood    hold him  hold him  he hasn t paid toll he hasn t showed his passport    but the stream became stronger and stronger   the tin soldier could see the bright daylight where the arch ended  but he heard a roaring noise  which might well frighten a bolder man   only think just where the tunnel ended the drain ran into a great canal  and for him that would have been as dangerous as for us to be carried down a great waterfall   now he was already so near it that he could not stop   the boat was carried out  the poor tin soldier stiffening himself as much as he could  and no one could say that he moved an eyelid   the boat whirled round three or four times  and was full of water to the very edge  it must sink   the tin soldier stood up to his neck in water  and the boat sank deeper and deeper  and the paper was loosened more and more  and now the water closed over the soldier s head   then he thought of the pretty little dancer  and how he should never see her again  and it sounded in the soldier s ears    farewell  farewell  thou warrior brave   die shalt thou this day    and now the paper parted  and the tin soldier fell out  but at that moment he was snapped up by a great fish   oh  how dark it was in that fish s body   it was darker yet than in the drain tunnel  and then it was very narrow  too   but the tin soldier remained unmoved  and lay at full length  shouldering his musket   the fish swam to and fro  he made the most wonderful movements  and then became quite still   at last something flashed through him like lightning   the daylight shone quite clear  and a voice said aloud   the tin soldier   the fish had been caught  carried to market  bought  and taken into the kitchen  where the cook cut him open with a large knife   she seized the soldier round the body with both her hands  and carried him into the room  where all were anxious to see the remarkable man who had traveled about in the inside of a fish  but the tin soldier was not at all proud   they placed him on the table  and there no  what curious things may happen in the world   the tin soldier was in the very room in which he had been before   he saw the same children  and the same toys stood upon the table  and there was the pretty castle with the graceful little dancer   she was still balancing herself on one leg and held the other extended in the air   she was faithful  too  that moved the tin soldier  he was very near weeping tin tears  but that would not have been proper   he looked at her  but they said nothing to each other   then one of the little boys took the tin soldier and flung him into the stove   he gave no reason for doing this   it must have been the fault of the goblin in the snuffbox   the tin soldier stood there quite illuminated  and felt a heat that was terrible  but whether this heat proceeded from the real fire or from love he did not know   the colors had quite gone off from him  but whether that had happened on the journey  or had been caused by grief  no one could say   he looked at the little lady  she looked at him  and he felt that he was melting  but he stood firm  shouldering his musket  then suddenly the door flew open  and the draft of air caught the dancer  and she flew like a sylph just into the stove to the tin soldier  and flashed up in a flame  and then was gone   then the tin soldier melted down into a lump  and when the servant maid took the ashes out next day  she found him in the shape of a little tin heart  but of the dancer nothing remained but the tinsel rose  and that was burned as black as coal   the fir tree  by hans christian andersen  out in the woods stood a nice little fir tree   the place he had was a very good one  the sun shone on him  as to fresh air  there was enough of that  and round him grew many large sized comrades  pines as well as firs   but the little fir wanted so very much to be a grown up tree   he did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air  he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the wood looking for wild strawberries   the children often came with a whole pitcher full of berries  or a long row of them threaded on a straw  and sat down near the young tree and said   oh  how pretty he is   what a nice little fir   but this was what the tree could not bear to hear   at the end of a year he had shot up a good deal  and after another year he was another long bit taller  for with fir trees one can always tell by the shoots how many years old they are    oh  were i but such a high tree as the others are   sighed he    then i should be able to spread out my branches  and with the tops to look into the wide world   then would the birds build nests among my branches  and when there was a breeze  i could bend with as much stateliness as the others    neither the sunbeams  nor the birds  nor the red clouds which morning and evening sailed above him  gave the little tree any pleasure   in winter  when the snow lay glittering on the ground  a hare would often come leaping along  and jump right over the little tree   oh  that made him so angry   but two winters were past  and in the third the tree was so large that the hare was obliged to go round it    to grow and grow  to get older and be tall   thought the tree  that  after all  is the most delightful thing in the world    in autumn the woodcutters always came and felled some of the largest trees   this happened every year  and the young fir tree  that had now grown to a very comely size  trembled at the sight  for the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking  the branches were lopped off  and the trees looked long and bare  they were hardly to be recognized  and then they were laid in carts  and the horses dragged them out of the wood   where did they go to   what became of them   in spring  when the swallows and the storks came  the tree asked them   don t you know where they have been taken   have you not met them anywhere    the swallows did not know anything about it  but the stork looked musing  nodded his head  and said   yes  i think i know  i met many ships as i was flying hither from egypt  on the ships were magnificent masts  and i venture to assert that it was they that smelled so of fir  i may congratulate you  for they lifted themselves on high most majestically     oh  were i but old enough to fly across the sea   but how does the sea look in reality   what is it like     that would take a long time to explain   said the stork  and with these words off he went    rejoice in thy growth   said the sunbeams   rejoice in thy vigorous growth  and in the fresh life that groweth within thee    and the wind kissed the tree  and the dew wept tears over him  but the fir understood it not   when christmas came  quite young trees were cut down  trees which often were not even as large or of the same age as this fir tree  who could never rest  but always wanted to be off   these young trees  and they were always the finest looking  retained their branches  they were laid on carts  and the horses drew them out of the wood    where are they going to   asked the fir    they are not taller than i  there was one indeed that was considerably shorter   and why do they retain all their branches   whither are they taken     we know   we know   chirped the sparrows     we have peeped in at the windows in the town below   we know whither they are taken   the greatest splendor and the greatest magnificence one can imagine await them   we peeped through the windows  and saw them planted in the middle of the warm room  and ornamented with the most splendid things  with gilded apples  with gingerbread  with toys  and many hundred lights     and then   asked the fir tree  trembling in every bough    and then  what happens then     we did not see anything more  it was incomparably beautiful     i would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a career   cried the tree  rejoicing    that is still better than to cross the sea  what a longing do i suffer   were christmas but come   i am now tall  and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year  oh  were i but already on the cart   were i in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence   yes  then something better  something still grander  will surely follow  or wherefore should they thus ornament me   something better  something still grander  must follow  but what   oh  how i long  how i suffer   i do not know myself what is the matter with me     rejoice in our presence   said the air and the sunlight   rejoice in thy own fresh youth    but the tree did not rejoice at all  he grew and grew  and was green both winter and summer   people that saw him said   what a fine tree   and toward christmas he was one of the first that was cut down   the ax struck deep into the very pith  the tree fell to the earth with a sigh  he felt a pang  it was like a swoon  he could not think of happiness  for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home  from the place where he had sprung up   he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades  the little bushes and flowers around him  any more  perhaps not even the birds   the departure was not at all agreeable   the tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees  and heard a man say   that one is splendid   we don t want the others    then two servants came in rich livery and carried the fir tree into a large and splendid drawing room   portraits were hanging on the walls  and near the white porcelain stove stood two large chinese vases with lions on the covers   there  too  were large easy chairs  silken sofas  large tables full of picture books  and full of toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the children said so   and the fir tree was stuck upright in a cask that was filled with sand  but no one could see that it was a cask  for green cloth was hung all round it  and it stood on a large gayly colored carpet   oh  how the tree quivered   what was to happen   the servants  as well as the young ladies  decorated it   on one branch there hung little nets cut out of colored paper  and each net was filled with sugarplums  and among the other boughs gilded apples and walnuts were suspended  looking as though they had grown there  and little blue and white tapers were placed among the leaves   dolls that looked for all the world like men  the tree had never beheld such before were seen among the foliage  and at the very top a large star of gold tinsel was fixed  it was really splendid  beyond description splendid    this evening   said they all   how it will shine this evening     oh   thought the tree   if the evening were but come   if the tapers were but lighted   and then i wonder what will happen   perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me   perhaps the sparrows will beat against the windowpanes   i wonder if i shall take root here  and winter and summer stand covered with ornaments    he knew very much about the matter   but he was so impatient that for sheer longing he got a pain in his back  and this with trees is the same thing as a headache with us   the candles were now lighted   what brightness   what splendor   the tree trembled so in every bough that one of the tapers set fire to the foliage   it blazed up splendidly    help   help   cried the young ladies  and they quickly put out the fire   now the tree did not even dare tremble   what a state he was in   he was so uneasy lest he should lose something of his splendor  that he was quite bewildered amid the glare and brightness  when suddenly both folding doors opened  and a troop of children rushed in as if they would upset the tree   the older persons followed quietly  the little ones stood quite still   but it was only for a moment  then they shouted so that the whole place reechoed with their rejoicing  they danced round the tree  and one present after the other was pulled off    what are they about   thought the tree    what is to happen now   and the lights burned down to the very branches  and as they burned down they were put out one after the other  and then the children had permission to plunder the tree   so they fell upon it with such violence that all its branches cracked  if it had not been fixed firmly in the cask  it would certainly have tumbled down   the children danced about with their beautiful playthings  no one looked at the tree except the old nurse  who peeped between the branches  but it was only to see if there was a fig or an apple left that had been forgotten    a story   a story   cried the children  drawing a little fat man toward the tree   he seated himself under it  and said   now we are in the shade  and the tree can listen too   but i shall tell only one story   now which will you have  that about ivedyavedy  or about klumpy dumpy who tumbled downstairs  and yet after all came to the throne and married the princess     ivedy avedy   cried some   klumpy dumpy   cried the others   there was such a bawling and screaming    the fir tree alone was silent  and he thought to himself   am i not to bawl with the rest  am i to do nothing whatever   for he was one of the company  and had done what he had to do   and the man told about klumpy dumpy that tumbled down  who notwithstanding came to the throne  and at last married the princess  and the children clapped their hands  arid cried out   oh  go on   do go on   they waited to hear about ivedy avedy too  but the little man only told them about klumpy dumpy   the fir tree stood quite still and absorbed in thought  the birds in the wood had never related the like of this    klumpy dumpy fell downstairs  and yet he married the princess   yes  yes   that s the way of the world   thought the fir tree  and believed it all  because the man who told the story was so good looking    well  well   who knows  perhaps i may fall downstairs too  and get a princess as wife    and he looked forward with joy to the morrow  when he hoped to be decked out again with lights  play  things  fruits  and tinsel    i won t tremble to morrow   thought the fir tree    i will enjoy to the full all my splendor   to morrow i shall hear again the story of klumpy dumpy  and perhaps that of ivedy avedy too   and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought   in the morning the servant and the housemaid came in    now then the splendor will begin again   thought the fir   but they dragged him out of the room  and up the stairs into the loft  and here  in a dark corner  where no daylight could enter  they left him   what s the meaning of this   thought the tree    what am i to do here  what shall i hear now  i wonder    and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie   time enough had he too for his reflections  for days and nights passed on  and nobody came up  and when at last somebody did come  it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way  there stood the tree quite hidden  it seemed as if he had been entirely forgotten     tis now winter out of doors   thought the tree    the earth is hard and covered with snow  men cannot plant me now  and therefore i have been put up here under shelter till the springtime comes   how thoughtful that is   how kind man is  after all   if it only were not so dark here  and so terribly lonely   not even a hare   and out in the woods it was so pleasant  when the snow was on the ground  and the hare leaped by  yes even when he jumped over me  but i did not like it then  it is really terribly lonely here     squeak   squeak   said a little mouse at the same moment  peeping out of his hole   and then another little one came   they snuffed about the fir tree  and rustled among the branches    it is dreadfully cold   said the mouse    but for that  it would be delightful here  old fir  wouldn t it     i am by no means old   said the fir tree    there s many a one considerably older than i am     where do you come from   asked the mice   and what can you do    they were so extremely curious    tell us about the most beautiful spot on the earth   have you never been there   were you never in the larder  where cheeses lie on the shelves  and hams hang from above  where one dances about on tallow candles  that place where one enters lean  and comes out again fat and portly     i know no such place   said the tree    but i know the wood  where the sun shines  and where the little birds sing    and then he told all about his youth  and the little mice had never heard the like before  and they listened and said    well  to be sure   how much you have seen   how happy you must have been     i   said the fir tree  thinking over what he had himself related   yes  in reality those were happy times    and then he told about christmas eve  when he was decked out with cakes and candles    oh   said the little mice   how fortunate you have been  old fir tree     i am by no means old   said he    i came from the wood this winter  i am in my prime  and am only rather short for my age     what delightful stories you know   said the mice  and the next night they came with four other little mice  who were to hear what the tree recounted  and the more he related  the more plainly he remembered all himself  and it appeared as if those times had really been happy times   but they may still come they may still come   humpy dumpy fell downstairs  and yet he got a princess   and he thought at the moment of a nice little birch tree growing out in the woods  to the fir  that would be a real charming princess    who is klumpy dumpy   asked the mice   so then the fir tree told the whole fairy tale  for he could remember every single word of it  and the little mice jumped for joy up to the very top of the tree   next night two more mice came  and on sunday two rats  even  but they said the stories were not interesting  which vexed the little mice  and they  too  now began to think them not so very amusing either    do you know only one story   asked the rats    only that one   answered the tree    i heard it on my happiest evening  but i did not then know how happy i was     it is a very stupid story   don t you know one about bacon and tallow candles   can t you tell any larder stories     no   said the tree    then good by   said the rats and they went home   at last the little mice stayed away also  and the tree sighed   after all  it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and listened to what i told them   now that too is over   but i will take good care to enjoy myself when i am brought out again    but when was that to be   why  one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft   the trunks were moved  the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard  it is true  down on the floor  but a man drew him toward the stairs  where the daylight shone    now a merry life will begin again   thought the tree   he felt the fresh air  the first sunbeam  and now he was out in the courtyard   all passed so quickly  there was so much going on around him  that the tree quite forgot to look to himself   the court adjoined a garden  and all was in flower  the roses hung so fresh and odorous over the balustrade  the lindens were in blossom  the swallows flew by  and said  quirre  vit   my husband is come   but it was not the fir tree that they meant    now  then  i shall really enjoy life   said he  exultingly  and spread out his branches  but  alas   they were all withered and yellow   it was in a corner that he lay  among weeds and nettles   the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree  and glittered in the sunshine   in the courtyard some of the merry children were playing who had danced at christmas round the fir tree  and were so glad at the sight of him  one of the youngest ran and tore off the golden star    only look what is still on the ugly old christmas tree   said he  trampling on the branches  so that they all cracked beneath his feet   and the tree beheld all the beauty of the flowers  and the freshness in the garden  he beheld himself  and wished he had remained in his dark corner in the loft  he thought of his first youth in the wood  of the merry christmas eve  and of the little mice who had listened with so much pleasure to the story of humpy dumpy     tis over  tis past   said the poor tree    had i but rejoiced when i had reason to do so   but now  tis past   tis past    and the gardener s boy chopped the tree into small pieces  there was a whole heap lying there   the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper  and it sighed so deeply   each sigh was like a shot   the boys played about in the court  and the youngest wore the gold star on his breast which the tree had had on the happiest evening of his life   however  that was over now the tree gone  the story at an end  all  all was over  every tale must end at last   the flying trunk  by hans christian andersen  there was once a merchant  who was so rich that he could pave the whole street with gold  and almost have enough left for a little lane   but he did not do that  he knew how to employ his money differently   when he spent a shilling he got back a crown  such a clever merchant was he  and this continued till he died   his son now got all this money  and he lived merrily  going to the masquerade every evening  making kites out of dollar notes  and playing at ducks and drakes on the seacoast with gold pieces instead of pebbles   in this way the money might soon be spent  and indeed it was so   at last he had no more than four shillings left  and no clothes to wear but a pair of slippers and an old dressing gown   now his friends did not trouble themselves any more about him as they could not walk with him in the street  but one of them  who was good  natured  sent him an old trunk  with the remark    pack up    yes  that was all very well  but he had nothing to pack  therefore he seated himself in the trunk   that was a wonderful trunk   so soon as any one pressed the lock the trunk could fly   he pressed it  and whirr   away flew the trunk with him through the chimney and over the clouds farther and farther away  but as often as the bottom of the trunk cracked a little he was in great fear lest it might go to pieces  and then he would have flung a fine somersault   in that way he came to the land of the turks   he hid the trunk in a wood under some dry leaves  and then went into the town  he could do that very well  for among the turks all the people went about dressed like himself in dressing gown and slippers   then he met a nurse with a little child    here  you turkish nurse   he began   what kind of a great castle is that close by the town  in which the windows are so high up     there dwells the sultan s daughter   replied she    it is prophesied that she will be very unhappy respecting a lover  and therefore nobody may go near her  unless the sultan and sultana are there too     thank you   said the merchant s son  and he went out into the forest  seated himself in his trunk  flew on the roof  and crept through the window into the princess s room   she was lying asleep on the sofa  and she was so beautiful that the merchant s son was compelled to kiss her   then she awoke  and was startled very much  but he said he was a turkish angel who had come down to her through the air  and that pleased her   they sat down side by side  and he told her stories about her eyes  and he told her they were the most glorious dark lakes  and that thoughts were swimming about in them like mermaids   and he told her about her forehead  that it was a snowy mountain with the most splendid halls and pictures   and he told her about the stork who brings the lovely little children   yes  those were fine histories   then he asked the princess if she would marry him  and she said   yes   directly    but you must come here on saturday   said she    then the sultan and sultana will be here to tea   they will be very proud that i am to marry a turkish angel   but take care that you know a very pretty story  for both my parents are very fond indeed of stories   my mother likes them high flown and moral  but my father likes them merry  so that one can laugh     yes  i shall bring no marriage gift but a story   said he  and so they parted   but the princess gave him a saber  the sheath embroidered with gold pieces and that was very useful to him   now he flew away  bought a new dressing gown  and sat in the forest and made up a story  it was to be ready by saturday  and that was not an easy thing   by the time he had finished it saturday had come   the sultan and his wife and all the court were at the  princess s to tea   he was received very graciously    will you relate us a story   said the sultana   one that is deep and edifying     yes  but one that we can laugh at   said the sultan    certainly   he replied  and so began   and now listen well    there was once a bundle of matches  and these matches were particularly proud of their high descent   their genealogical tree  that is to say  the great fir tree of which each of them was a little splinter  had been a great old tree out in the forest   the matches now lay between a tinder box and an old iron pot  and they were telling about the days of their youth    yes  when we were upon the green boughs   they said   then we really were upon the green boughs   every morning and evening there was diamond tea for us i mean dew  we had sunshine all day long whenever the sun shone  and all the little birds had to tell stories   we could see very well that we were rich  for the other trees were only dressed out in summer  while our family had the means to wear green dresses in the winter as well   but then the woodcutter came  like a great revolution  and our family was broken up  the head of the family got an appointment as mainmast in a first rate ship  which could sail round the world if necessary  the other branches went to other places  and now we have the office of kindling a light for the vulgar herd   that s how we grand people came to be in the kitchen      my fate was of different kind   said the iron pot  which stood next to the matches    from the beginning  ever since i came into the world  there has been a great deal of scouring and cooking done in me   i look after the practical part  and am the first here in the house   my only pleasure is to sit in my place after dinner  very clean and neat  and to carry on a sensible conversation with my comrades   but except the waterpot  which is sometimes taken down into the courtyard  we always live within our four walls   our only newsmonger is the market basket  but he speaks very uneasily about the government and the people   yes  the other day there was an old pot that fell down  from fright  and burst   he s liberal  i can tell you     now you re talking too much   the tinder box interrupted  and the steel struck against the flint  so that sparks flew out    shall we not have a merry evening      yes  let us talk about who is the grandest   said the matches     no  i don t like to talk about myself   retorted the pot   let us get up an evening entertainment   i will begin   i will tell a story from real life  something that everyone has experienced  so that we can easily imagine the situation  and take pleasure in it    on the baltic  by the danish shore      that s a pretty beginning   cried all the plates    that will be a story we shall like      yes  it happened to me in my youth  when i lived in a family where the furniture was polished  the floors scoured  and new curtains were put up every fortnight      what an interesting way you have of telling a story   said the carpet broom    one can tell directly that a man is speaking who has been in woman s society   there s something pure runs through it     and the pot went on telling the story  and the end was as good as the beginning    all the plates rattled with joy  and the carpet broom brought some green parsley out of the dust hole  and put it like a wreath on the pot  for he knew that it would vex the others    if i crown him to  day   it thought   he will crown me tomorrow      now i ll dance   said the fire tongs  and they danced   preserve us  how that implement could lift up one leg   the old chair cushion burst to see it    shall i be crowned too   thought the tongs  and indeed a wreath was awarded     they re only common people  after all   thought the matches    now the tea urn was to sing  but she said she had taken cold and could not sing unless she felt boiling within   but that was only affectation  she did not want to sing  except when she was in the parlor with the grand people    in the window sat an old quill pen  with which the maid generally wrote  there was nothing remarkable about this pen  except that it had been dipped too deep into the ink  but she was proud of that    if the tea urn won t sing   she said   she may leave it alone   outside hangs a nightingale in a cage  and he can sing   he hasn t had any education  but this evening we ll say nothing about that      i think it very wrong   said the teakettle  he was the kitchen singer  and half brother to the tea urn  that that rich and foreign bird should be listened to   is that patriotic   let the market basket decide      i am vexed   said the market basket    no one can imagine how much i am secretly vexed   is that a proper way of spending the evening  would it not be more sensible to put the house in order   let each one go to his own place  and i will arrange the whole game   that would be quite another thing     yes  let us make a disturbance  cried they all   then the door opened  and the maid came in  and they all stood still  not one stirred   but there was not one pot among them who did not know what he could do and how grand he was    yes  if i had liked   each one thought   it might have been a very merry evening     the servant girl took the matches and lighted the fire with them  mercy   how they sputtered and burst out into flame   now everyone can see   thought they   that we are the first   how we shine   what a light   and they burned out     that was a capital story   said the sultana    i feel myself quite carried away to the kitchen  to the matches   yes  now thou shalt marry our daughter     yes  certainly   said the sultan   thou shalt marry our daughter on monday    and they called him thou  because he was to belong to the family   the wedding was decided on  and on the evening before it the whole city was illuminated   biscuits and cakes were thrown among the people  the street boys stood on their toes  called out  hurrah   and whistled on their fingers   it was uncommonly splendid    yes  i shall have to give something as a treat   thought the merchant s son   so he bought rockets and crackers  and every imaginable sort of fire work  put them all into his trunk  and flew up into the air    crack   how they went  and how they went off   all the turks hopped up with such a start that their slippers flew about their ears  such a meteor they had never yet seen   now they could understand that it must be a turkish angel who was going to marry the princess   what stories people tell   everyone whom he asked about it had seen it in a separate way  but one and all thought it fine    i saw the turkish angel himself   said one    he had eyes like glowing stars  and a beard like foaming water     he flew up in a fiery mantle   said another   the most lovely little cherub peeped forth from among the folds    yes  they were wonderful things that he heard  and on the following day he was to be married   now he went back to the forest to rest himself in his trunk   but what had become of that   a spark from the fireworks had set fire to it  and the trunk was burned to ashes   he could not fly any more  and could not get to his bride   she stood all day on the roof waiting  and most likely she is waiting still   but he wanders through the world  telling fairy tales  but they are not so merry as that one he told about the matches   the darning needle  by hans christian andersen  there was once a darning needle  who thought herself so fine  she imagined she was an embroidery needle    take care  and mind you hold me tight   she said to the fingers that took her out    don t let me fall   if i fall on the ground i shall certainly never be found again  for i am so fine     that s as it may be   said the fingers  and they grasped her round the body    see  i m coming with a train   said the darning needle  and she drew a long thread after her  but there was no knot in the thread   the fingers pointed the needle just at the cook s slipper  in which the upper leather had burst  and was to be sewn together    that s vulgar work   said the darning needle    i shall never get through   i m breaking   i m breaking   and she really broke    did i not say so   said the darning needle   i m too fine     now it s quite useless   said the fingers  but they were obliged to hold her fast  all the same  for the cook dropped some sealing wax upon the needle  and pinned her handkerchief together with it in front    so  now i m a breastpin   said the darning needle    i knew very well that i should come to honor  when one is something  one comes to something    and she laughed quietly to herself and one can never see when a darning needle laughs   there she sat  as proud as if she was in a state coach  and looked all about her    may i be permitted to ask if you are of gold   she inquired of the pin  her neighbor    you have a very pretty appearance  and a peculiar head  but it is only little   you must take pains to grow  for it s not everyone that has sealing wax dropped upon him    and the darning needle drew herself up so proudly that she fell out of the handkerchief right into the sink  which the cook was rinsing out    now we re going on a journey   said the darning needle    if i only don t get lost    but she really was lost    i m too fine for this world   she observed  as she lay in the gutter   but i know who i am  and there s always something in that    so the darning needle kept her proud behavior  and did not lose her good humor   and things of many kinds swam over her  chips and straws and pieces of old newspapers    only look how they sail   said the darning needle    they don t know what is under them   i m here  i remain firmly here   see  there goes a chip thinking of nothing in the world but of himself of a chip  there s a straw going by now   how he turns   how he twirls about  don t think only of yourself  you might easily run up against a stone  there swims a bit of newspaper   what s written upon it has long been forgotten  and yet it gives itself airs   i sit quietly and patiently here   i know who i am  and i shall remain what i am    one day something lay close beside her that glittered splendidly  then the darning needle believed that it was a diamond  but it was a bit of broken bottle  and because it shone  the darning needle spoke to it  introducing herself as a breastpin    i suppose you are a diamond   she observed    why  yes  something of that kind    and then each believed the other to be a very valuable thing  and they began speaking about the world  and how very conceited it was    i have been in a lady s box   said the darning needle   and this lady was a cook   she had five fingers on each hand  and i never saw anything so conceited as those five fingers   and yet they were only there that they might take me out of the box and put me back into it     were they of good birth   asked the bit of bottle    no  indeed   cried the darning needle   but very haughty   there were five brothers  all of the finger family   they kept very proudly together  though they were of different lengths  the outermost  the thumbling  was short and fat  he walked out in front of the ranks  and only had one joint in his back  and could only make a single bow  but he said that if he were hacked off a man  that man was useless for service in war   daintymouth  the second finger  thrust himself into sweet and sour  pointed to sun and moon  and gave the impression when they wrote   longrnan  the third  looked at all the others over his shoulder   goldborder  the fourth  went about with a golden belt round his waist  and little playman did nothing at all  and was proud of it  there was nothing but bragging among them  and therefore i went away     and now we sit here and glitter   said the bit of bottle   at that moment more water came into the gutter  so that it overflowed  and the bit of bottle was carried away    so he is disposed of   observed the darning needle    i remain here  i am too fine   but that s my pride  and my pride is honorable    and proudly she sat there  and had many great thoughts    i could almost believe i had been born of a sunbeam  i m so fine   it really appears as if the sunbeams were always seeking for me under the water   ah  i m so fine that my mother cannot find me   if i had my old eye  which broke off  i think i should cry  but  no  i should not do that  it s not genteel to cry    one day a couple of street boys lay grubbing in the gutter where they sometimes find old nails  farthings  and similar treasures   it was dirty work  but they took great delight in it    oh   cried one  who had pricked himself with the darning needle  there s a fellow for you     i m not a fellow  i m a young lady   said the darning needle   but nobody listened to her   the sealing wax had come off  and she had turned black  but black makes one look slender  and she thought herself finer even than before    here comes an eggshell sailing along   said the boys  and they stuck the darning needle fast in the eggshell    white walls  and black myself   that looks well   remarked the darning needle    now one can see me   i only hope i shall not be seasick   but she was not seasick at all    it is good against seasickness  if one has a steel stomach  and does not forget that one is a little more than an ordinary person   now my seasickness is over   the finer one is  the more one can bear     crack   went the eggshell  for a wagon went over her    good heavens  how it crushes one   said the darning needle    i m getting seasick now i m quite sick    but she was not really sick  though the wagon went over her  she lay there at full length  and there she may lie   pen and inkstand  by hans christian andersen  the following remark was made in a poet s room  as the speaker looked at the inkstand that stood upon his table    it is marvelous all that can come out of that ink stand   what will it produce next   yes  it is marvelous     so it is   exclaimed the inkstand    it is incomprehensible   that is what i always say    it was thus the inkstand addressed itself to the pen  and to everything else that could hear it on the table    it is really astonishing all that can come from me   it is almost incredible  i positively do not know myself what the next thing may be  when a person begins to dip into me   one drop of me serves for half a side of paper  and what may not then appear upon it   i am certainly something extraordinary   from me proceed all the works of the poets   these animated beings  whom people think they recognize these deep feelings  that gay humor  these charming descriptions of nature  i do not understand them myself  for i know nothing about nature  but still it is all in me   from me have gone forth  and still go forth  these warrior hosts  these lovely maidens  these bold knights on snorting steeds  those droll characters in humbler life   the fact is  however  that i do not know anything about them myself   i assure you they are not my ideas     you are right there   replied the pen    you have few ideas  and do not trouble yourself much with thinking  if you did exert yourself to think  you would perceive that you ought to give something that was not dry   you supply me with the means of committing to paper what i have in me  i write with that   it is the pen that writes   mankind do not doubt that  and most men have about as much genius for poetry as an old inkstand     you have but little experience   said the ink stand    you have scarcely been a week in use  and you are already half worn out   do you fancy that you are a poet   you are only a servant  and i have had many of your kind before you came  many of the goose family  and of english manufacture   i know both quill pens and steel pens   i have had a great many in my service  and i shall have many more still  when he  the man who stirs me up  comes and puts down what he takes from me   i should like very much to know what will be the next thing he will take from me     ink tub   said the pen   late in the evening the poet returned home   he had been at a concert  had heard a celebrated violin player  and was quite enchanted with his wonderful performance   it had been a complete gush of melody that he had drawn from the instrument   sometimes it seemed like the gentle murmur of a rippling stream  sometimes like the singing of birds  sometimes like the tempest sweeping through the mighty pine forests  he fancied he heard his own heart weep  but in the sweet tones that can be heard in a woman s charming voice   it seemed as if not only the strings of the violin made music  but its bridge  its pegs  and its sounding board   it was astonishing   the piece had been a most difficult one  but it seemed like play as if the bow were but wandering capriciously over the strings   such was the appearance of facility  that everyone might have supposed he could do it   the violin seemed to sound of itself  the bow to play of itself   these two seemed to do it all   one forgot the master who guided them  who gave them life and soul   yes  they forgot the master  but the poet thought of him   he named him  and wrote down his thoughts as follows    how foolish it would be of the violin and the bow  were they to be vain in their performance   and yet this is what so often we of the human species are   poets  artists  those who make discoveries in science  military and naval commanders  we are all proud of ourselves  and yet we are all only the instruments in our lord s hands   to him alone be the glory   we have nothing to arrogate to ourselves    this was what the poet wrote  and he headed it with   the master and the instruments     well  madam   said the pen to the inkstand when they were again alone   you heard him read aloud what i had written     yes  what i gave you to write   said the ink stand    it was a hit at you for your conceit   strange that you cannot see that people make a fool of you   i gave you that hit pretty cleverly   i confess  though  it was rather malicious     inkholder   cried the pen    writing stick   cried the inkstand   they both felt assured that they had answered well  and it is a pleasant reflection that one has made a smart reply one sleeps comfortably after it   and they both went to sleep  but the poet could not sleep   his thoughts welded forth like the tones from the violin  trilling like pearls  rushing like a storm through the forest   he recognized the feeling of his own heart he perceived the gleam from the everlasting master   to him alone be the glory   cinderella  retold by miss mulock  there was once an honest gentleman who took for his second wife a lady  the proudest and most disagreeable in the whole country   she had two daughters exactly like herself in all things   he also had one little girl  who resembled her dead mother  the best woman in all the world  scarcely had the second marriage taken place  than the stepmother became jealous of the good qualities of the little girl who was so great a contrast to her own two daughters   she gave her all the menial occupations of the house  compelled her to wash the floors and staircases  to dust the bedrooms  and clean the grates  and while her sisters occupied carpeted chambers hung with mirrors  where they could see themselves from head to foot  this poor little damsel was sent to sleep in an attic  on an old straw mattress  with only one chair and not a looking glass in the room   she suffered all in silence  not daring to complain to her father  who was entirely ruled by his new wife   when her daily work was done  she used to sit down in the chimney corner among the ashes  from which the two sisters gave her the nickname of cinderella   but cinderella  however  shabbily clad  was handsomer than they were with all their fine clothes   it happened that the king s son gave a series of balls  to which were invited all the rank and fashion of the city  and among the rest the two elder sisters   they were very proud and happy  and occupied their whole time in deciding what they should wear  a source of new trouble to cinderella  whose duty it was to get up their fine linen and laces  and who never could please them however much she tried   they talked of nothing but their clothes    i   said the elder   shall wear my velvet gown and my trimmings of english lace     and i   added the younger   will have but my ordinary silk petticoat  but i shall adorn it with an upper skirt of flowered brocade  and shall put on my diamond tiara  which is a great deal finer than anything of yours    here the elder sister grew angry  and the dispute began to run so high that cinderella  who was known to have excellent taste  was called upon to decide between them   she gave them the best advice she could  and gently and submissively offered to dress them herself  and especially to arrange their hair  an accomplishment in which she excelled many a noted coiffeur   the important evening came  and she exercised all her skill to adorn the two young ladies   while she was combing out the elder s hair  this ill natured girl said sharply   cinderella  do you not wish you were going to the ball     ah  madam   they obliged her always to say madam    you are only mocking me  it is not my fortune to have any such pleasure     you are right  people would only laugh to see a little cinder wench at a ball    any other than cinderella would have dressed the hair all awry  but she was good  and dressed it perfectly even and smooth  and as prettily as she could   the sisters had scarcely eaten for two days  and had broken a dozen staylaces a day  in trying to make themselves slender  but to night they broke a dozen more  and lost their tempers over and over again before they had completed their toilet   when at last the happy moment arrived  cinderella followed them to the coach  after it had whirled them away  she sat down by the kitchen fire and cried   immediately her godmother  who was a fairy  appeared beside her    what are you crying for  my little maid     oh  i wish i wish    her sobs stopped her    you wish to go to the ball  isn t it so     cinderella nodded    well then  be a good girl  and you shall go   first run into the garden and fetch me the largest pumpkin you can find    cinderella did not comprehend what this had to do with her going to the ball  but being obedient and obliging  she went   her godmother took the pumpkin  and having scooped out all its inside  struck it with her wand  it became a splendid gilt coach  lined with rose colored satin    now fetch me the mousetrap out of the pantry  my dear    cinderella brought it  it contained six of the fattest  sleekest mice  the fairy lifted up the wire door  and as each mouse ran out she struck it and changed it into a beautiful black horse    but what shall i do for your coachman  cinderella    cinderella suggested that she had seen a large black rat in the rat trap  and he might do for want of better    you are right  go and look again for him    he was found  and the fairy made him into a most respectable coachman  with the finest whiskers imaginable   she afterward took six lizards from behind the pumpkin frame  and changed them into six footmen  all in splendid livery  who immediately jumped up behind the carriage  as if they had been footmen all their days    well  cinderella  now you can go to the ball     what  in these clothes   said cinderella piteously  looking down on her ragged frock   her godmother laughed  and touched her also with the wand  at which her wretched threadbare jacket became stiff with gold  and sparkling with jewels  her woolen petticoat lengthened into a gown of sweeping satin  from underneath which peeped out her little feet  no longer bare  but covered with silk stockings  and the prettiest glass slippers in the world    now  cinderella  depart  but remember  if you stay one instant after midnight  your carriage will become a pumpkin  your coachman a rat  your horses mice  and your footmen lizards  while you  yourself  will be the little cinder wench you were an hour ago    cinderella promised without fear  her heart was so full of joy   arrived at the palace  the king s son  whom some one  probably the fairy  had told to await the coming of an uninvited princess  whom nobody knew  was standing at the entrance  ready to receive her   he offered her his hand  and led her with the utmost courtesy through the assembled guests  who stood aside to let her pass  whispering to one another   oh  how beautiful she is    it might have turned the head of anyone but poor cinderella  who was so used to be despised  that she took it all as if it were something happening in a dream   her triumph was complete  even the old king said to the queen  that never since her majesty s young days had he seen so charming and elegant a person   all the court ladies scanned her eagerly  clothes and all  determining to have theirs made next day of exactly the same pattern   the king s son himself led her out to dance  and she danced so gracefully that he admired her more and more   indeed  at supper  which was fortunately early  his admiration quite took away his appetite   for cinderella  herself  with an involuntary shyness  sought out her sisters  placed herself beside them and offered them all sorts of civil attentions  which coming as they supposed from a stranger  and so magnificent a lady  almost overwhelmed them with delight   while she was talking with them  she heard the clock strike a quarter to twelve  and making a courteous adieu to the royal family  she reentered her carriage  escorted tenderly by the king s son  and arrived in safety at her own door   there she found her godmother  who smiled approval  and of whom she begged permission to go to a second ball  the following night  to which the queen had earnestly invited her   while she was talking  the two sisters were heard knocking at the gate  and the fairy godmother vanished  leaving cinderella sitting in the chimney corner  rubbing her eves and pretending to be very sleepy    ah   cried the eldest sister maliciously   it has been the most delightful ball  and there was present the most beautiful princess i ever saw  who was so exceedingly polite to us both     was she   said cinderella indifferently   and who might she be     nobody knows  though everybody would give their eyes to know  especially the king s son     indeed   replied cinderella  a little more interested   i should like to see her   miss javotte   that was the elder sister s name  will you not let me go to morrow  and lend me your yellow gown that you wear on sundays     what  lend my yellow gown to a cinder wench   i am not so mad as that   at which refusal cinderella did not complain  for if her sister really had lent her the gown  she would have been considerably embarrassed   the next night came  and the two young ladies  richly dressed in different toilets  went to the ball   cinderella  more splendidly attired and beautiful than ever  followed them shortly after    now remember twelve o clock   was her godmother s parting speech  and she thought she certainly should   but the prince s attentions to her were greater even than the first evening  and in the delight of listening to his pleasant conversation  time slipped by unperceived   while she was sitting beside him in a lovely alcove  and looking at the moon from under a bower of orange blossoms  she heard a clock strike the first stroke of twelve   she started up  and fled away as lightly as a deer   amazed  the prince followed  but could not catch her   indeed he missed his lovely princess altogether  and only saw running out of the palace doors  a little dirty lass whom he had never beheld before  and of whom he certainly would never have taken the least notice   cinderella arrived at home breathless and weary  ragged and cold  without carriage  or footman or coachman  the only remnant of her past magnificence being one of her little glass slippers the other she had dropped in the ballroom as she ran away   when the two sisters returned  they were full of this strange adventure  how the beautiful lady had appeared at the ball more beautiful than ever  and enchanted everyone who looked at her  and how as the clock was striking twelve she had suddenly risen up and fled through the ballroom  disappearing no one knew how or where  and dropping one of her glass slippers behind her in her flight   how the king s son had remained inconsolable  until he chanced to pick up the little glass slipper  which he carried away in his pocket  and was seen to take it out continually  and look at it affectionately  with the air of a man very much in love  in fact  from his behavior during the remainder of the evening  all the court and royal family were convinced that he had become desperately enamored of the wearer of the little glass slipper   cinderella listened in silence  turning her face to the kitchen fire  and perhaps it was that which made her look so rosy  but nobody ever noticed or admired her at home  so it did not signify  and next morning she went to her weary work again just as before   a few days after  the whole city was attracted by the sight of a herald going round with a little glass slipper in his hand  publishing with a flourish of trumpets  that the king s son ordered this to be fitted on the foot of every lady in the kingdom  and that he wished to marry the lady whom it fitted best  or to whom it and the fellow slipper belonged   princesses  duchesses  countesses  and simple gentlewomen all tried it on  but being a fairy slipper  it fitted nobody  and besides  nobody could produce its fellow slipper  which lay all the time safely in the pocket of cinderella s old linsey gown   at last the herald came to the house of the two sisters  and though they well knew neither of themselves was the beautiful lady  they made every attempt to get their clumsy feet into the glass slipper  but in vain    let me try it on   said cinderella from the chimney corner    what  you   cried the others  bursting into shouts of laughter  but cinderella only smiled  and held out her hand   her sisters cou1d not prevent her  since the command was that every young maiden in the city should try on the slipper  in order that no chance might be left untried  for the prince was nearly breaking his heart  and his father and mother were afraid that though a prince  he would actually die for love of the beautiful unknown lady   so the herald bade cinderella sit down on a three legged stool in the kitchen  and himself put the slipper on her pretty little foot  which it fitted exactly  she then drew from her pocket the fellow slipper  which she also put on  and stood up for with the touch of the magic shoes all her dress was changed likewise no longer the poor despised cinder wench  but the beautiful lady whom the king s son loved   her sisters recognized her at once   filled with astonishment  mingled with no little alarm  they threw themselves at her feet  begging her pardon for all their former unkindness   she raised and embraced them  told them she forgave them with all her heart  and only hoped they would love her always   then she departed with the herald to the king s palace  and told her whole story to his majesty and the royal family  who were not in the least surprised  for everybody believed in fairies  and everybody longed to have a fairy godmother   for the young prince  he found her more lovely and lovable than ever  and insisted upon marrying her immediately   cinderella never went home again  but she sent for her two sisters to the palace  and with the consent of all parties married them shortly after to two rich gentlemen of the court   little red riding hood  by charles perrault  once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl  the prettiest creature ever seen   her mother was very fond of her  and her grandmother doted on her still more   this good woman had made for her a little red riding hood  which became the girl so well that everybody called her little red riding hood   one day her mother  having made some custards  said to her    go  my dear  and see how thy grandmamma does  for i hear she has been very ill  carry her a custard and this little pot of butter    little red riding hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother  who lived in another village   as she was going through the wood she met with gaffer wolf  who had a very great mind to eat her up  but he durst not  because of some fagot makers hard by in the forest   he asked her whither she was going   the poor child  who did not know that it was dangerous to stop and listen to a wolf  said to him    i am going to see my grandmamma and carry her a custard and a little pot of butter from my mamma     does she live far off   said the wolf    oh   yes   answered little red riding hood   it is beyond that mill you see there  at the first house in the village     well   said the wolf   i ll go and see her  too   i ll go this way and you go that  and we shall see who will be there soonest    the wolf began to run as fast as he could  taking the nearest way  and the little girl went by the longest  diverting herself in gathering nuts  running after butterflies  and making nosegays of such little flowers as she met with   the wolf was not long before he got to the old woman s house   he knocked at the door tap  tap    who s there     your grandchild  little red riding hood   replied the wolf  imitating her voice   who has brought you a custard and a little pot of butter sent you by mamma    the good grandmother  who was in bed  because she was ill  cried out    pull the bobbin  and the latch will go up    the wolf pulled the bobbin  and the door opened  and he fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment  for it was above three days that he had not touched a bit   he then shut the door and went into the grandmother s bed  expecting little red riding hood  who came some time afterward and knocked at the door tap  tap    who s there    little red riding hood  hearing the big voice of the wolf  was at first afraid  but believing her grandmother had got a cold and was hoarse  answered    tis your grandchild  little red riding hood  who has brought you a custard and a little pot of butter mamma sends you    the wolf cried out to her  softening his voice as much as he could    pull the bobbin and the latch will go up    little red riding hood pulled the bobbin and the door opened   the wolf  seeing her come in  said to her  hiding himself under the bedclothes    put the custard and the little pot of butter upon the stool  and come and lie down with me    little red riding hood undressed herself and went into bed  where  being greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her night clothes  she said to her    grandmamma  what great arms you ve got     that is the better to hug thee  my dear     grandmamma  what great legs you ve got     the better to run  my child     grandmamma  what great ears you ve got     the better to hear  my child     grandmamma  what great eyes you ve got     the better to see  my child     grandmamma  what great teeth you ve got     to eat thee up    and saying these words  the wicked wolf fell upon little red riding  hood and ate her all up   the story of the three bears  by robert southey  once upon a time there were three bears  who lived together in a house of their own in a wood   one of them was a little  small  wee bear  and one was a middle sized bear  and the other was a great  huge bear  they had each a pot for their porridge  a little pot for the little  small  wee bear  and a middle sized pot for the middle bear  and a great pot for the great  huge bear   and they had each a chair to sit in  a little chair for the little  small  wee bear  and a middle sized chair for the middle bear  and a great chair for the great  huge bear  and they had each a bed to sleep in  a little bed for the little  small  wee bear  and a middle sized bed for the middle bear  and a great bed for the great  huge bear   one day  after they had made the porridge for their breakfast and poured it into their porridge pots  they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling  that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon to eat it   and while they were walking a little old woman came to the house   she could not have been a good  honest  old woman  for  first  she looked in at the window  and then she peeped in at the keyhole  and  seeing nobody in the house  she lifted the latch  the door was not fastened  because the bears were good bears  who did nobody any harm  and never suspected that anybody would harm them   so the little old woman opened the door and went in  and well pleased she was when she saw the porridge on the table   if she had been a good little old woman she would have waited till the bears came home  and then  perhaps  they would have asked her to breakfast  for they were good hears a little rough or so  as the manner of bear s is  but for all that very good natured and hospitable   but she was an impudent  bad old woman  and set about helping herself   so first she tasted the porridge of the great huge bear  and that was too hot for her  and she said a bad word about that   and then she tasted the porridge of the middle bear  and that was too cold for her  and she said a bad word about that  too   and then she went to the porridge of the little  small  wee bear  and tasted that  and that was neither too hot nor too cold  but just right  and she liked it so well that she ate it all up  but the naughty old woman said a bad word about the little porridge pot  because it did not hold enough for her   then the little old woman sat down in the chair of the great  huge bear  and that was too hard for her   and then she sat down in the chair of the middle bear  and that was too soft for her   and then she sat down in the chair of the little small  wee bear  and that was neither too hard nor too soft  but just right   so she seated herself in it  and there she sat till the bottom of the chair came out  and down came she  plump upon the ground   and the naughty old woman said wicked words about that  too   then the little old woman went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the three bears slept   and first she lay down upon the bed of the great  huge bear  but that was too high at the head for her   and next she lay down upon the bed of the middle bear  and that was too high at the foot for her   and then she lay down upon the bed of the little  small  wee bear  and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot  but just right   so she covered herself up comfortably  and lay there till she fell asleep   by this time the three bears thought their porridge would be cool enough  so they came home to breakfast   now the little old woman had left the spoon of the great  huge bear standing in his porridge    somebody has been at my porridge    said the great  huge bear  in his great gruff voice   and when the middle bear looked at his  he saw that the spoon was standing in it  too   they were wooden spoons  if they had been silver ones the naughty old woman would have put them in her pocket    somebody has been at my porridge    said the middle bear  in his middle voice   then the little  small  wee bear looked at his  and there was the spoon in the porridge pot  but the porridge was all gone    somebody has been at my porridge  and has eaten it all up    said the little  small  wee bear  in his little  small  wee voice   upon this the three bears  seeing that some one had entered their house and eaten up the little  small  wee bear s breakfast  began to look about them   now the little old woman had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the great  huge bear    somebody has been sitting in my chair    said the great  huge bear  in his great  rough  gruff voice   and the little old woman had squatted down the soft cushion of the middle bear    somebody has been sitting in my chair    said the middle bear  in his middle voice   and you know what the little old woman had done to the third chair    somebody has been sitting in my chair  and has sat the bottom out of it    said the little  small  wee bear  in his little  small  wee voice   then the three bears thought it necessary that they should make further search  so they went upstairs into their bedchamber   now the little old woman had pulled the pillow of the great  huge bear out of its place    somebody has been lying in my bed    said the great  huge bear  in his great  rough  gruff voice   and the little old woman had pulled the bolster of the middle bear out of its place    somebody has been lying in my bed    said the middle bear  in his middle voice   and when the little  small  wee bear came to look at his bed  there was the bolster in its place  and upon the pillow was the little old woman s ugly  dirty head which was not in its place  for she had no business there    somebody has been lying in my bed and here she is    said the little  small  wee bear  in his little  small  wee voice   the little old woman had heard in her sleep the great  rough  gruff voice of the great  huge bear  but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the moaning of wind or the rumbling of thunder  and she had heard the middle voice of the middle bear  but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream   but when she heard the little  small  wee voice of the little  small  wee bear  it was so sharp and so shrill that it awakened her at once   up she started  and when she saw the three bears on one side of the bed she tumbled herself out at the other and ran to the window   now the window was open  because the bears  like good  tidy bears as they were  always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning   out the little old woman jumped  and whether she broke her neck in the fall or ran into the wood and was lost there  or found her way out of the wood and was taken up by the constable and sent to the house of correction for a vagrant as she was  i cannot tell   but the three bears never saw anything more of her   puss in boots  by charles perrault  a miller  dying  divided all his property between his three children  this was very easy  as he had nothing to leave but his mill  his ass  and his cat  so he made no will  and called in no lawyer   the eldest son had the mill  the second  the ass  and the youngest  nothing but the cat   the young fellow was quite downcast at so poor a lot    my brothers   said he   by putting their property together  may gain an honest living  but there is nothing left for me except to die of hunger  unless  indeed  i were to kill my cat and eat him  and make a muff of his skin    the cat  who heard all this  sat up on his four paws  and looking at him with a grave and wise air  said   master  i think you had better not kill me  i shall be much more useful to you alive     how so   asked his master    you have but to give me a sack and a pair of boots  such as gentlemen wear when they go shooting  and you will find you are not so ill off as you suppose    now  though the young man did not much depend upon the cat s words  still he thought it rather surprising that a cat should speak at all  and he had before now seen him play a great many cunning tricks in catching rats and mice  so that it seemed advisable to trust him a little further  especially as poor young fellow he had nobody else to trust   when the cat got his boots  he drew them on with a grand air  and slinging his sack over his shoulder  and drawing the cords of it round his neck  he marched bravely to a rabbit warren hard by  with which he was well acquainted   then  putting some bran and lettuces into his bag  and stretching himself out beside it as if he were dead  he waited till some fine  fat young rabbit  ignorant of the wickedness and deceit of the world  should peep into the sack to eat the food that was inside   this happened very shortly  for there are plenty of foolish young rabbits in every warren  and when one of them  who really was a splendid fat fellow  put his head inside  master puss drew the cords immediately  and took him and killed him without mercy   then  very proud of his prey  he marched direct to the palace  and begged to speak with the king   he was told to ascend to the apartment of his majesty  where  making a low bow  he said    sire  here is a magnificent rabbit  killed in the warren  which belongs to my lord the marquis of carabas  and which he told me to offer humbly to your majesty     tell your master   replied the king  politely   that i accept his present  and am very much obliged to him    another time  puss went out and hid himself and his sack in a wheat field  and there caught two splendid fat partridges in the same manner as he had done the rabbit   when he presented them to the king  with a similar message as before  his majesty was so pleased that he ordered the cat to be taken down into the kitchen and given something to eat and drink  where  while enjoying himself  the faithful animal did not cease to talk in the most cunning way of the large preserves and abundant game which belonged to his lord the marquis of carabas   one day  hearing that the king was intending to take a drive along the riverside with his daughter  the most beautiful princess in the world  puss said to his master    sir  if you would only follow my advice  your fortune is made     be it so   said the miller s son  who was growing disconsolate  and cared very little what he did    say your say  cat     it is but little   replied puss  looking wise  as cats can    you have only to go and bathe in the river at a place which i shall show you  and leave all the rest to me   only remember that you are no longer yourself  but my lord the marquis of carabas     just so   said the miller s son   it s all the same to me   but he did as the cat told him   while he was bathing  the king and all the court passed by  and were startled to hear loud cries of  help  help   my lord the marquis of carabas is drowning    the king put his head out of the carriage  and saw nobody but the cat  who had at different times brought him so many presents of game  however  he ordered his guards to fly quickly to the succor of my lord the marquis of carabas   while they were pulling the unfortunate marquis out of the water  the cat came up  bowing  to the side of the king s carriage  and told a long and pitiful story about some thieves who  while his master was bathing  had come and carried away all his clothes  so that it would be impossible for him to appear before his majesty and the illustrious princess    oh  we will soon remedy that   answered the king  kindly and immediately ordered one of the first officers of the household to ride back to the palace with all speed  and bring thence a supply of fine clothes for the young gentleman  who kept out of sight until they arrived   then  being handsome and well made  his new clothes became him so well  that he looked as if he had been a marquis all his days  and advanced with an air of respectful ease to offer his thanks to his majesty   the king received him courteously  and the princess admired him very much   indeed  so charming did he appear to her  that she hinted to her father to invite him into the carriage with them  which  you may be sure the young man did not refuse   the cat  delighted at the success of his scheme  went away as fast as he could  and ran so swiftly that he kept a long way ahead of the royal carriage   he went on and on  till he came to some peasants who were mowing in a meadow    good people   said he  in a very firm voice   the king is coming past here shortly  and if you do not say that the field you are mowing belongs to my lord the marquis of carabas  you shall all be chopped as small as mincemeat    so when the king drove by  and asked whose meadow it was where there was such a splendid crop of hay  the mowers all answered  trembling  that it belonged to my lord the marquis of carabas    you have very fine land  marquis   said his majesty to the miller s son  who bowed  and answered that  it was not a bad meadow  take it altogether    then the cat came to a wheat field  where the reapers were reaping with all their might   he bounced in upon them    the king is coming past to day  and if you do not tell him that this wheat belongs to my lord the marquis of carabas  i will have you everyone chopped as small as mincemeat    the reapers  very much alarmed  did as they were bid  and the king congratulated the marquis upon possessing such beautiful fields  laden with such an abundant harvest   they drove on the cat always running before and saying the same thing to everybody he met  that they were to declare that the whole country belonged to his master  so that even the king was astonished at the vast estate of my lord the marquis of carabas   but now the cat arrived at a great castle where dwelt an ogre  to whom belonged all the land through which the royal carriage had been driving   this ogre was a cruel tyrant  and his tenants and servants were terribly afraid of him  which accounted for their being so ready to say whatever they were told to say by the cat  who had taken pains to inform himself all about the ogre   so  putting on the boldest face he could assume  puss marched up to the castle with his boots on  and asked to see the owner of it  saying that he was on his travels  but did not wish to pass so near the castle of such a noble gentleman without paying his respects to him   when the ogre heard this message  he went to the door  received the cat as civilly as an ogre can  and begged him to walk in and repose himself    thank you  sir   said the cat   but first i hope you will satisfy a traveler s curiosity   i have heard in far countries of your many remarkable qualities  and especially how you have the power to change yourself into any sort of beast you choose a lion  for instance  or an elephant     that is quite true   replied the ogre   and lest you should doubt it i will immediately become a lion    he did so  and the cat was so frightened that he sprang up to the roof of the castle and hid himself in the gutter a proceeding rather inconvenient on account of his boots  which were not exactly fitted to walk with on tiles   at length  perceiving that the ogre had resumed his original form  he came down again  and owned that he had been very much frightened    but  sir   said he   it may be easy enough for such a big gentleman as you to change himself into a large animal  i do not suppose you could become a small one a rat  or mouse  for instance   i have heard that you can  still  for my part  i consider it quite impossible     impossible   cried the other  indignantly    you shall see   and immediately the cat saw the ogre no longer  but a little mouse running along on the floor   this was exactly what puss wanted  and he fell upon him at once and ate him up   so there was an end to the ogre   by this time the king had arrived opposite the castle  and had a strong wish to go into it   the cat  hearing the noise of the carriage wheels  ran forward in a great hurry  and  standing at the gate  said  in a loud voice    welcome  sire  to the castle of my lord the marquis of carabas     what   cried his majesty  very much surprised   does the castle also belong to you   truly  marquis  you have kept your secret well up to the last minute   i have never seen anything finer than this courtyard and these battlements   let us go in  if you please    the marquis  without speaking  offered his hand to the princess to help her to descend  and  standing aside that the king might enter first  followed his majesty to the great hall  where a magnificent dinner was laid out  and where  without more delays they all sat down to feast   before the banquet was over  the king  charmed with the good qualities of the marquis of carabas  said  bowing across the table at which the princess and the miller s son were talking very confidentially together    it rests with you  marquis  whether you will marry my daughter     i shall be only too happy   said the marquis  and the princess s cast  down eyes declared the same   so they were married the very next day  and took possession of the ogre s castle  and of everything that had belonged to him   as for the cat  he became at once a great lord  and had nevermore any need to run after mice  except for his own diversion   jack the giant killer  retold by joseph jacobs  in the reign of the famous king arthur there lived in cornwall a lad named jack  who was a boy of a bold temper and took delight in hearing or reading of conjurers  giants  and fairies  and used to listen eagerly to the deeds of the knights of king arthur s round table   in those days there lived on st  michael s mount  off cornwall  a huge giant  eighteen feet high and nine feet round  his fierce and savage looks were the terror of all who beheld him   he dwelt in a gloomy cavern on the top of the mountain  and used to wade over to the mainland in search of prey  when he would throw half a dozen oxen upon his back  and tie three times as many sheep and hogs round his waist  and march back to his own abode   the giant had done this for many years when jack resolved to destroy him   jack took a horn  a shovel  a pickaxe  his armor  and a dark lantern  and one winter s evening he went to the mount   there he dug a pit twenty two feet deep and twenty broad   he covered the top over so as to make it look like solid ground   he then blew such a blast on his horn that the giant awoke and came out of his den  crying out    you saucy villain  you shall pay for this   i ll broil you for my breakfast    he had just finished  when  taking one step farther  he tumbled headlong into the pit  and jack struck him a blow on the head with his pickaxe which killed him   jack then returned home to cheer his friends with the news   another giant  called blunderbore  vowed to be revenged on jack if ever he should have him in his power   this giant kept an enchanted castle in the midst of a lonely wood  and some time after the death of cormoran  jack was passing through a wood  and  being weary  sat down and went to sleep   the giant  passing by and seeing jack  carried him to his castle  where he locked him up in a large room  the floor of which was covered with the bodies  skulls  and bones of men and women   soon after  the giant went to fetch his brother  who was likewise a giant  to take a meal off his flesh  and jack saw with terror through the bars of his prison the two giants approaching   jack  perceiving in one corner of the room a strong cord  took courage  and making a slip knot at each end  he threw them over their heads  and tied it to the window bars  he then pulled till he had choked them  when they were black in the face he slid down the rope and stabbed them to the heart   jack next took a great bunch of keys from the pocket of blunderbore and went into the castle again   he made a strict search through all the rooms  and in one of them found three ladies tied up by the hair of their heads and almost starved to death   they told him that their husbands had been killed by the giants  who had then condemned them to be starved to death    ladies   said jack   i have put an end to the monster and his wicked brother  and i give you this castle and all the riches it contains to make some amends for the dreadful pains you have felt    he then very politely gave them the keys of the castle and went farther on his journey to wales   as jack had but little money  he went on as fast as possible   at length he came to a handsome house   jack knocked at the door  when there came forth a welsh giant   jack said he was a traveler who had lost his way  on which the giant made him welcome and let him into a room where there was a good bed to sleep in   jack took off his clothes quickly  but though he was weary he could not go to sleep   soon after this he heard the giant walking backward and forward in the next room and saying to himself    though here you shall lodge with me this night   you shall not see the morning light   my club shall dash your brains out quite     say you so   thought jack    are these your tricks upon travelers  but i hope to prove as cunning as you are    then  getting out of bed  he groped about the room and at last found a thick tog of wood   he laid it in his own place in the bed  and then hid himself in a dark corner of the room   the giant  about midnight  entered the apartment  and with his bludgeon struck many blows on the bed  in the very place where jack had laid the log  and then he went back to his own room  thinking he had broken all jack s bones   early in the morning jack put a bold face upon the matter and walked into the giant s room to thank him for his lodging   the giant started when he saw him  and began to stammer out    oh  dear me  is it you  pray  how did you sleep last night   did you hear or see anything in the dead of the night     nothing worth speaking of   said jack  carelessly   a rat  i believe  gave me three or four slaps with its tail  and disturbed me a little  but i soon went to sleep again    the giant wondered more and more at this  yet he did not answer a word  but went to bring two great bowls of hasty pudding for their breakfast  jack wanted to make the giant believe that he could eat as much as himself so he contrived to button a leathern bag inside his coat and slip the hasty pudding into this bag while he seemed to put it into his mouth   when breakfast was over he said to the giant    now i will show you a fine trick   i can cure all wounds with a touch  i could cut off my head in one minute  and the next put it sound again on my shoulders  you shall see an example    he then took hold of the knife  ripped up the leathern bag  and all the hasty pudding tumbled out upon the floor    ods splutter hur nails   cried the welsh giant  who was ashamed to be outdone by such a little fellow as jack   hur can do that hurself   so he snatched up the knife  plunged it into his own stomach  and in a moment dropped down dead   jack  having hitherto been successful in all his undertakings  resolved not to be idle in future  he therefore furnished himself with a horse  a cap of knowledge  a sword of sharpness  shoes of swiftness  and an invisible coat  the better to perform the wonderful enterprises that lay before him   he traveled over high hills  and on the third day he came to a large and spacious forest through which his road lay   scarcely had he entered the forest when he beheld a monstrous giant dragging along by the hair of their heads a handsome knight and his lady   jack alighted from his horse  and tying him to an oak tree  put on his invisible coat  under which he carried his sword of sharpness   when he came up to the giant he made several strokes at him  but could not reach his body  but wounded his thighs in several places  and at length  putting both hands to his sword and aiming with all his might  he cut off both his legs   then jack  setting his foot upon his neck  plunged his sword into the giant s body  when the monster gave a groan and expired   the knight and his 1ady thanked jack for their deliverance  and invited him to their house to receive a proper reward for his services    no   said jack   i cannot be easy till i find out this monster s habitation    so taking the knight s directions  he mounted his horse and soon after came in sight of another giant  who was sitting on a block of timber waiting for his brother s return   jack alighted from his horse  and  putting on his invisible coat  approached and aimed a blow at the giant s head  but missing his aim he only cut off his nose   on this the giant seized his club and laid about him most unmercifully    nay   said jack   if this be the case i d better dispatch you    so jumping upon the block  he stabbed him in the back  when he dropped down dead   jack then proceeded on his journey  and traveled over hills and dales till  arriving at the foot of a high mountain  he knocked at the door of a lonely house  when an old man let him in   when jack was seated the hermit thus addressed him    my son  on the top of this mountain is an enchanted castle  kept by the giant galligantus and a vile magician   i lament the fate of a duke s daughter  whom they seized as she was walking in her father s garden  and brought hither transformed into a deer    jack promised that in the morning  at the risk of his life  he would break the enchantment  and after a sound sleep he rose early  put on his invisible coat  and got ready for the attempt   when he had climbed to the top of the mountain he saw two fiery griffins  but he passed between them without the least fear of danger  for they could not see him because of his invisible coat   on the castle gate he found a golden trumpet  under which were written these lines   whoever can this trumpet blow  shall cause the giant s overthrow   as soon as jack had read this he seized the trumpet and blew a shrill blast  which made the gates fly open and the very castle itself tremble   the giant and the conjurer now knew that their wicked course was at an end  and they stood biting their thumbs and shaking within fear   jack  with his sword of sharpness  soon killed the giant  and the magician was then carried away by a whirlwind  and every knight and beautiful lady who had been changed into birds and beasts returned to their proper shapes   the castle vanished away like smoke  and the head of the giant galligantus was sent to king arthur   the knights and ladies rested that night at the old man s hermitage  and next day they set out for the court   jack then went up to the king and gave his majesty an account of all his fierce battles   jack s fame had now spread through the whole country  and at the king s desire the duke gave him his daughter in marriage  to the joy of all his kingdom   after this the king gave him a large estate  on which he and his lady lived the rest of their days in joy and contentment   tom thumb  retold by joseph jacobs  in the days of the great prince arthur  there lived a mighty magician  named merlin  the most learned and skillful enchanter the world has ever seen   this famous magician  who could take any form he pleased  was travelling about as a poor  beggar  and being very tired he stopped at the cottage of a ploughman to rest himself  and asked for some food   the countryman bade him welcome  and his wife  who was a very good  hearted woman  brought him some milk in a wooden bowl and some coarse brown bread on a platter   merlin was much pleased with the kindness of the ploughman and his wife  but he could not help noticing that though everything was neat and comfortable in the cottage  they both seemed to be very unhappy  he therefore asked them why they were so melancholy  and learned that they were miserable because they had no children   the poor woman said  with tears in her eves    i should be the happiest creature in the world if i had a son although he was no bigger than my husband s thumb    merlin was so much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger than a man s thumb that he determined to grant the poor woman s wish   accordingly  in a short time after  the ploughman s wife had a son  who  wonderful to relate   was not a bit bigger than his father s thumb   the queen of the fairies  wishing to see the little fellow  came in at the window  while the mother was sitting up in bed admiring him   the queen kissed the child  and  giving it the name of tom thumb  sent for some of the fairies  who dressed her little godson according to her orders   an oak leaf hat he had for his crown   his shirt of web by spiders spun   with jacket wove of thistle s down   his trousers were of feathers done   his stockings  of apple rind  they tie  with eyelash from his mother s eye   his shoes were made of mouse s skin   tann d with the downy hair within   tom never grew any larger than his father s thumb  but as he got older he became very cunning and full of tricks   when he was old enough to play with the boys  and had lost all his own cherry stones  he used to creep into the bags of his play fellows  fill his pockets  and  getting out without their noticing him  would again join in the game   one day  as he was coming out of a bag of cherry stones  where he had been stealing as usual  the boy to whom it belonged chanced to see him   ah  ah  my little tommy   said the boy   so i have caught you stealing my cherry stones at last  and you shall be rewarded for your thievish tricks    on saying this  he drew the string tight round his neck  and gave the bag such a hearty shake that poor little tom s legs  thighs and body were sadly bruised   he roared out with pain and begged to be let out  promising never to steal again   a short time afterwards his mother was making a batter pudding  and tom  being anxious to see how it was made  climbed up to the edge of the bowl  but his foot slipped  and he plumped over head and ears into the batter  without his mother noticing him  who stirred him into the pudding bag  and put him in the pot to boil   the batter filled tom s mouth  and prevented him from crying  but  upon feeling the hot water  he kicked and struggled so much in the pot that his mother thought that the pudding was bewitched  and  pulling it out of the pot  she threw it outside the door   a poor tinker  who was passing by  lifted up the pudding  put it in his bag  and walked off  as tom had now got his mouth cleared of the batter  he began to cry aloud  which so frightened the tinker that he flung down the pudding and ran away   the pudding being broke to pieces by the fall  tom crept out covered all over with the batter  and walked home   his mother  who was very sorry to see her darling in such a woeful state  put him into a teacup and soon washed off the batter  after which she kissed him and laid him in bed   soon after the adventure of the pudding  tom s mother went to milk her cow in the meadow  and she took him along with her   as the wind was very high  for fear of being blown away  she tied him to a thistle with a piece of fine thread   the cow soon observed tom s oak leaf hat  and liking the appearance of it  took poor tom and the thistle at one mouthful   while the cow was chewing the thistle tom was afraid of her great teeth  which threatened to crush him in pieces  and he roared out as loud as he could    mother  mother     where are you  tommy  my dear tommy   said his mother    here  mother   replied he   in the red cow s mouth    his mother began to cry and wring her hands  but the cow  surprised at the odd noise in her throat  opened her mouth and let tom drop out  fortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to the ground  or he would have been dreadfully hurt   she then put tom in her bosom and ran home with him   tom s father made him a whip of barley straw to drive the cattle with  and having one day gone into the fields  tom slipped a foot and rolled into the furrow   a raven  which was flying over  picked him up and flew with him over the sea  and there dropped him   a large fish swallowed tom the moment he fell into the sea  which was soon after caught and bought for the table of king arthur   when they opened the fish in order to cook it  every one was astonished at finding such a little boy  and tom was quite delighted at being free again   they carried him to the king  who made tom his dwarf  and he soon became a great favorite at court  for by his tricks and gambols he not only amused the king and queen  but also the knights of the round table   it is said that when the king rode out on horseback he often took tom along with him  and if a shower came on he used to creep into his majesty s waistcoat pocket  where he slept till the rain was over   king arthur one day asked tom about his parents  wishing to know if they were as small as he was  and whether they were well off   tom told the king that his father and mother were as tall as anybody about the court  but in rather poor circumstances   on hearing this  the king carried tom to his treasury  the place where he kept all his money  and told him to take as much money as he could carry home to his parents  which made the poor little fellow caper with joy   tom went immediately to procure a purse which was made of a water bubble  and then returned to the treasury  where he received a silver three penny piece to put into it   our little hero had some difficulty in lifting the burden upon his back  but he at last succeeded in getting it placed and set forward on his journey   without meeting with any accident  and after resting himself more than a hundred times by the way  in two days and two nights he reached his father s house in safety   tom had traveled forty eight hours with a huge silver piece on his back  and was almost tired to death  when his mother ran out to meet him and carried him into the house   but he soon returned to court   as tom s clothes had suffered much in the batter pudding and the inside of the fish  his majesty ordered him a new suit of clothes  and to be mounted as a knight on a mouse   of butterfly s wings his shirt was made   his boots of chicken s hide   and by a nimble fairy blade   well learned in the tailoring trade   his clothing was supplied   a needle dangled by his side   a dapper mouse he used to ride   thus strutted tom in stately pride   it was certainly very amusing to see him in this dress and mounted on the mouse  as he rode out a hunting with the king and nobility  who were all ready to expire with laughter at tom and his fine prancing charioteer   the king was so charmed with his address that he ordered a little chair to be made  in order that tom might sit upon his table  and also a palace of gold  a span high  with a door an inch wide  to live in   he also gave him a coach  drawn by six small mice   the queen was so enraged at the honors conferred on sir thomas that she resolved to ruin him  and told the king that the little knight had been saucy to her   the king sent for tom in great haste  but being fully aware of the danger of royal anger  he crept into an empty snail shell  where he lay for a long time until he was almost starved with hunger  at last he ventured to peep out  and seeing a fine large butterfly on the ground  near the place of his concealment  he got close to it and jumping astride on it was carried up into the  air   the butterfly flew with him from tree to tree and from field to field  at last returned to the court  where the king and nobility all strove to catch him  but at last poor tom fell from his seat into a watering pot  in which he was almost drowned   when the queen saw him she was in a rage  and said he should be beheaded  and he was again put into a mouse trap until the time of his execution   however  a cat  observing something alive in the trap  patted it about till the wires broke  and set thomas at liberty   the king received tom again into favor  which he did not live to enjoy  for a large spider one day attacked him  and although he drew his sword and fought well  yet the spider s poisonous breath at last overcame him   king arthur and his whole court were so sorry at the loss of their little favorite that they went into mourning and raised a fine white marble monument over his grave with the following epitaph   here lies tom thumb  king arthur s knight   who died by a spider s cruel bite   he was well known in arthur s court   where he afforded gallant sport   he rode a tilt and tournament   and on a mouse a hunting went   alive he filled the court with mirth   his death to sorrow soon gave birth   wipe  wipe your eyes  and shake your head  and cry  alas   tom thumb is dead   blue beard  by charles perrault  there was once a man who had fine houses  both in town and country  a deal of silver and gold plate  embroidered furniture  and coaches gilded all over with gold   but this man was so unlucky as to have a blue beard  which made him so ugly that all the women and girls ran away from him   one of his neighbors  a lady of quality  had two daughters who were perfect beauties   he asked her for one of them in marriage  but neither of them could bear the thought of marrying a man who had a blue beard   besides  he had already been married several times  and nobody ever knew what became of his wives   in the hope of making them like him  blue beard took them  with their mother and three or four ladies of their acquaintance  and other young people of the neighborhood  to one of his country houses  where they stayed a whole week   there were parties of pleasure  hunting  fishing  dancing  mirth  and feasting all the time   nobody went to bed  but all passed the time in merry making and joking with one another   everything succeeded so well that the youngest daughter began to think the master of the house was a very civil gentleman   and his beard not so very blue after all   as soon as they returned home  the marriage took place   about a month afterward blue beard told his wife that he was obliged to take a journey for six weeks  about affairs of great consequence  desiring her to amuse herself in his absence  to send for her friends and acquaintances  to carry them in to the country if she pleased  and to have a good time wherever she was    here   said he   are the keys of the two great wardrobes wherein i have my best furniture  these are of my silver and gold plate  which is not every day in use  these open my strong boxes  which hold my money  both gold and silver  these my caskets of jewels  and this is the master key to all my apartments   this little one here is the key of the closet at the end of the great gallery on the ground floor   open them all  go into all and every one of them  except that little closet  which i forbid you  if you happen to open it  there s nothing but what you may expect from my just anger and resentment    she promised to observe exactly whatever he ordered  so  having embraced her  he got into his coach and proceeded on his journey   her neighbors and good friends did not wait to be sent for  so great was their impatience to see all the rich furniture of her house   they ran through all the rooms  closets  and wardrobes  which were all so fine and rich that they seemed to surpass one another   after that they went up into the two great rooms  where were the best and richest furniture  they could not sufficiently admire the number and beauty of the tapestries  beds  couches  cabinets  stands  tables  and looking glasses  in which you might see yourself from head to foot  some of them were framed with glass  others with silver  plain and gilded  the finest and most magnificent ever seen   they ceased not to compliment and envy their friend  but she was so much pressed by her curiosity to open the closet on the ground floor that  without considering that it was very uncivil to leave her company  she went down a little back staircase with such haste that she had twice or thrice like to have broken her neck   arriving at the closet door  she hesitated  thinking of her husband s orders and considering what unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient  but the temptation was so strong she could not overcome it   she took the little key and opened it  trembling  but could not at first see anything plainly because the windows were shut   after some moments she began to perceive that the floor was all covered with blood  in which lay the bodies of several dead women  ranged against the walls    these were the wives whom blue beard had married and murdered  one after another    she thought she would die for fear  and the key  which she pulled out of the lock  fell out of her hand   after having somewhat recovered from the shock  she took up the key  locked the door  and went upstairs to her bedroom to rest   having observed that the key of the closet was stained with blood  she tried two or three times to wipe it off  but the stain would not come out  in vain did she wash it  and even rub it with soap and sand  the blood still remained  for the key was magical  when the blood was removed from one side it came again on the other   blue beard returned from his journey the same evening  and said he had received letters upon the road informing him that the affair he went about was ended to his advantage   his wife did all she could to convince him she was extremely glad of his speedy return   next morning he asked her for the keys  which she gave him  but with such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened    what   said he   is not the key of my closet among the rest     i must certainly   said she   have left it above upon the table     fail not   said blue beard   to bring it to me presently    after several goings backward and forward she was forced to bring him the key   blue beard attentively considered it and said to his wife    how comes this blood upon the key     i do not know   cried the poor woman  paler than death    you do not know   replied blue beard    i very well know   you were resolved to go into the closet  were you not   very well  madam  you shall go in and take your place among the ladies you saw there   upon this she threw herself at her husband s feet  and begged his pardon with all the signs of a true repentance  vowing that she would never again be disobedient   she would have melted a rock  so beautiful and sorrowful was she  but blue beard had a heart harder than any rock    you must die  madam   said he   and that  very soon     since i must die   answered she  her eyes bathed in tears   give me some little time to say my prayers     i give you   replied blue beard   half a quarter of an hour  but not one moment more    when she was alone she called out to her sister    sister anne  go up  i beg you  on top of the tower and see if my brothers are not coming  they promised me that they would come to day  and if you see them  give them a sign to make haste    sister anne went up on the top of the tower  and the poor afflicted wife cried out from time to time    anne  sister anne  do you see anyone coming    and sister anne replied    i see nothing but the sun  which makes a dust  and the grass  which looks green    in the meanwhile blue beard  holding a great saber in his hand  cried out as loud as he could bawl to his wife    come down instantly  or i shall come up after you     one moment longer  if you please   said his wife  and then she cried out softly    anne  sister anne  dost thou see anybody coming    and sister anne answered    i see nothing but the sun  which makes a dust  and the grass  which is green     come down quickly   shouted blue beard   or i will come up after you     i am coming   answered his wife  and then she cried    anne  sister anne  dost thou not see any one coming     i see   replied sister anne   a great dust  which comes on this side     are they my brothers     alas   no  my dear sister  i see a flock of sheep     will you not come down   roared blue beard    one moment longer   said his wife  and then she cried out    anne  sister anne  dost thou see nobody coming     i see   said she   two horsemen  but they are yet a great way off     god be praised   replied the poor wife joyfully   they are my brothers  i will make them a sign  as well as i can  for them to make haste    then blue beard bawled out so loud that he made the whole house tremble   the distressed wife came down and threw herself at his feet  all in tears  with her hair about her shoulders    that will not help you   says blue beard   you must die   then  taking hold of her hair with one hand  and lifting up the sword with the other  he was going to cut off her head   the poor lady  turning to him and looking at him with dying eyes  begged him to give her one little moment more    no  no   said he   say your prayers   and was just about to strike     at this very instant there was such a loud knocking at the gate that blue beard looked up in alarm   the gate was opened and two horsemen entered  who drew their swords and ran directly at blue beard   he knew them to be his wife s brothers  one a dragoon  the other a musketeer  so that he quickly ran to save himself  but the two brothers pursued so close that they overtook him before he could get to the steps of the porch  and ran their swords through his body and left him dead   the poor wife was almost as dead as her husband  and had not strength enough to rise and welcome her brothers   blue beard had no heirs  and so his wife became mistress of all his estate   she made use of one part of it to marry her sister anne to a young gentleman who had loved her a long while  another part to buy captains  commissions for her brothers  and the rest to marry herself to a very worthy gentleman  who made her forget the unhappy time she had passed with blue beard   the brave little tailor  anonymous  one summer s day a little tailor sat on his table by the window in the best of spirits and sewed for dear life   as he was sitting thus a peasant woman came down the street  calling out    good jam to sell  good jam to sell    this sounded sweetly in the tailor s ears  he put his little head out of the window and shouted    up here  my good woman  and you ll find a willing customer    the woman climbed up the three flights of stairs with her heavy basket to the tailor s room  and he made her spread out the pots in a row before him   he examined them all  lifted them up and smelt them  and said at last    this jam seems good  weigh me four ounces of it  my good woman  and even if it s a quarter of a pound i won t stick at it    the woman  who had hoped to find a good market  gave him what he wanted  but went away grumbling wrathfully    now heaven shall bless this jam for my use   cried the little tailor   and it shall sustain and strengthen me    he fetched some bread out of a cupboard  cut a round off the loaf  and spread the jam on it    that will taste good   he said   but i ll finish that waistcoat first before i take a bite    he placed the bread beside him  went on sewing  and out of the lightness of his heart kept on making his stitches bigger and bigger   in the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to the ceiling  where swarms of flies were gathered  and attracted them to such an extent that they swarmed on to it in masses   ha  who invited you   said the tailor  and chased the unwelcome guests away   but the flies  who didn t understand english  refused to let themselves be warned off  and returned again in even greater numbers  at last the tailor  losing all patience  reached out of his chimney  corner for a duster  and exclaiming   wait  and i ll give it to you   he beat them mercilessly with it   when he left off he counted the slain  and no fewer than seven lay dead before him with outstretched legs    what a brave fellow i am   said he  and was filled with admiration at his own courage    the whole town must know about this   and in great haste the little tailor cut out a girdle  hemmed it  and embroidered on it in big letters   seven at a blow     what did i say  the town  no  the whole world shall hear of it   he said  and his heart beat for joy as a lamb wags his tail   the tailor strapped the girdle round his waist and set out into the wide world  for he considered his workroom too small a field for his bravery   before he set forth he looked round about him  to see if there was anything in the house he could take with him on his journey  but he found nothing except an old cheese  which he took possession of  in front of the house he observed a bird that had been caught in some bushes  and this he put into his wallet beside the cheese   then he went on his way merrily  and being light and quick he never felt tired  his way led up a hill on the top of which sat a powerful giant  who was calmly surveying the landscape   the little tailor went up to him  and greeting him cheerfully said   good day  friend  there you sit at your ease viewing the whole wide world   i m just on my way there   what do you say to accompanying me    the giant looked contemptuously at the tailor  and said    what a poor  wretched little creature you are    that s a good joke   answered the little tailor  and unbuttoning his coat he showed the giant the girdle    there  now  you can read what sort of a fellow i am    the giant read    seven at a blow   and thinking they were human beings the tailor had slain  he had a certain respect for the little man   but first he thought he d test him  so taking up a stone in his hand  he squeezed it till some drops of water ran out    now you do the same   said the giant   if you really wish to be thought strong     is that all    said the little tailor   that s child s play to me     so he dived into his wallet  brought out the cheese  and pressed it till the whey ran out    my squeeze was better than yours   said he   the giant didn t know what to say  for he couldn t have believed it of the little fellow   to prove him again  the giant lifted a stone and threw it so high that the eye could hardly follow it    now  my little dwarf  let me see you do that     well thrown   said the tailor   but  after all  your stone fell to the ground  i ll throw one that won t come down at all    he dived into his wallet again  and grasping the bird in his hand he threw it up into the air   the bird  enchanted to be free  soared up into the sky  and flew away never to return    well  what do you think of that little piece of business  friend   asked the tailor    you can certainly throw   said the giant   but now let s see if you can carry a proper weight    with these words he led the tailor to a huge oak tree which had been felled to the ground  and said    if you are strong enough  help me carry the tree out of the wood     most certainly   said the little tailor   just you take the trunk on your shoulder  i ll bear the top and branches  which is certainly the heaviest part    the giant laid the trunk on his shoulder  but the tailor sat at his ease among the branches  and the giant  who couldn t see what was going on behind him  had to carry the whole tree  and the little tailor into the bargain   there he sat behind in the best of spirits  lustily whistling a tune  as if carrying the tree were mere sport   the giant after dragging the heavy weight for some time  could get on no farther  and shouted out    hi   i must let the tree fall    the tailor sprang nimbly down  seized the tree with both hands as if he had carried it the whole way  and said to the giant    fancy a big lazy fellow like you not being able to carry a tree    they continued to go on their way together  and as they passed by a cherry tree the giant grasped the top of it  where the ripest fruit hung  gave the branches into the tailor s hand  and bade him eat   but the little tailor was far too weak to hold the tree down  and when the giant let go the tree swung back into the air  bearing the little tailor with it   when he had fallen to the ground again without hurting himself  the giant said    what   do you mean to tell me you haven t the strength to hold down a feeble twig     it wasn t strength that was wanting   replied time tailor   do you think that would have been anything for a man who has killed seven at a blow   i jumped over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting among the branches near us   do you do the like if you dare    the giant made an attempt  but couldn t get over the tree  and stuck fast in the branches  so that here  too  the little tailor had the better of him    well  you re a fine fellow  after all   said the giant   come and spend the night with us in our cave    the little tailor willingly consented to do this  and following his friend they went on till they reached a cave where several other giants were sitting round a fire  each holding a roast sheep in his hand  of which he was eating   the little tailor looked about him  and thought    yes  there s certainly more room to turn round in here than in my workshop    the giant showed him a bed  and bade him lie down and have a good sleep   but the bed was too big for the little tailor  so he didn t get into it  but crept away into the corner   at midnight  when the giant thought the little tailor was fast asleep  he rose up  and taking his big iron walking  stick  he broke the bed in two with a blow  and thought he had made an end of the little grasshopper   at early dawn the giants went off to the wood  and quite forgot about the little tailor  till all of a sudden they met him trudging along in the most cheerful manner   the giants were terrified at seeing him  and  fearing lest he should slay them  they all took to their heels as fast as they could   the little tailor continued to follow his nose  and after he had wandered about for a long time he came to the courtyard of a royal palace  and feeling tired he lay down on the grass and fell asleep  while he lay there the people came  and looking him all over read on his girdle   seven at a blow     oh   they said   what can this great hero of a hundred fights want in our peaceful land   he must indeed be a mighty man of valor    they went and told the king about him  and said what a weighty and useful man he d be in time of war and that it would be well to secure him at any price   this counsel pleased the king  and he sent one of his courtiers down to the little tailor  to offer him  when he awoke  a commission in their army   the messenger remained standing by the sleeper  and waited till he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes  when he tendered his proposal    that s the very thing i came here for   he answered   i am quite ready to enter the king s service    so he was received with all honor  and given a special house of his own to live in   but the other officers were angry at the success of the little tailor  and wished him a thousand miles away    what s to come of it all   they asked one another   if we quarrel with him  he ll let out at us  and at every blow seven will fall   there ll soon be an end of us    so they resolved to go in a body to the king  and all to send in their papers   we are not made   they said    to hold out against a man who kills seven at a blow    the king was grieved at the thought of losing all his faithful servants for the sake of one man  and he wished heartily that he had never set eyes on him  or that he could get rid of him  but he didn t dare to send him away  for he feared he might kill him and place himself on the throne   he thought long and deeply over the matter  and finally came to a conclusion   he sent for the tailor and told him that  seeing what a great and warlike hero he was  he was about to make him an offer   in a certain wood of his kingdom there dwelt two giants who did much harm by the way they robbed  murdered  burnt  and plundered everything about them   no one could approach them without endangering his life   if he could overcome and kill these two giants he should have the king s only daughter for a wife  and half his kingdom into the bargain  he might have a hundred horsemen  too  to back him up     that s the very thing for a man like me   thought the little tailor   one doesn t get the offer of a beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day     done with you   he answered   i ll soon put an end to the giants   but i haven t the smallest need of your hundred horsemen  a fellow who can slay seven men at a blow need not be afraid of two    the little tailor set out  and the hundred horsemen followed him   when he came to the outskirts of the wood he said to his followers    you wait here  i ll manage the giants by myself   and he went on into the wood  casting his sharp little eyes right and left about him   after a while he spied the two giants lying asleep under a tree  snoring till the very boughs bent with the breeze   the little tailor lost no time in filling his wallet with stones  and then climbed up the tree under which they lay   when he got to about the middle of it he slipped along a branch till he sat just above the sleepers  when he threw down one stone after the other on the nearest giant   the giant felt nothing for a long time  but at last he woke up  and pinching his companion said   what did you strike me for     i didn t strike you   said the other   you must be dreaming    they both lay down to sleep again  and the tailor threw down a stone on the second giant  who sprang up and cried   what s that for   why did you throw something at me     i didn t throw anything   growled the first one   they wrangled on for a time  till as both were tired  they made up the matter and fell asleep again   the little tailor began his game once more  and flung the largest stone he could find in his wallet with all his force  and hit the first giant on the chest    this is too much of a good thing   he yelled  and springing up like a madman  he knocked his companion against the tree till he trembled   he gave  however  as good as he got  and they became so enraged that they tore up trees and beat each other with them  till they both fell dead at once on the ground   then the little tailor jumped down    it s a mercy   he said   that they didn t root up the tree on which i was sitting  or i should have had to jump like a squirrel on to another  which  nimble though i am  would have been no easy job    he drew his sword and gave each of the giants a very fine thrust or two on the breast  and then went to the horsemen and said   the deed is done  i ve put an end to the two of them  but i assure you it has been no easy matter  for they even tore up trees in their struggle to defend themselves  but all that s of no use against one who slays seven men at a blow     weren t you wounded   asked the horsemen   no fear   answered the tailor   they haven t touched a hair of my head   but the horsemen wouldn t believe him till they rode into the wood and found the giants weltering in their blood  and the trees lying around  torn up by the roots   the little tailor now demanded the promised reward  but the king repented his promise  and pondered once more how he could rid himself of the hero    before you obtain the hand of my daughter and half my kingdom   he said to him   you must do another deed of valor   a unicorn is running about loose in the wood and doing much mischief  you must first catch it     i m even less afraid of one unicorn than of two giants  seven at a blow  that s my motto    he took a piece of cord and an axe with him  went out to the wood  and again told the men who had been sent with him to remain outside   he hadn t to search long  for the unicorn soon passed by  and  on perceiving the tailor  dashed straight at him as though it were going to spike him on the spot   gently  gently   said he   not so fast  my friend   and standing still he waited till the beast was quite near  when he sprang lightly behind a tree  the unicorn ran with all its force against the tree  and rammed its horn so firmly into the trunk that it had no strength left to pull it out again  and was thus successfully captured    now  i ve caught my bird   said the tailor  and he came out from behind the tree  placed the cord round its neck first  then struck the horn out of the tree within his axe  and when everything was in order led the beast before the king   still the king didn t want to give him the promised reward and made a third demand   the tailor was to catch a wild boar for him that did a great deal of harm in the wood  and he might have the huntsmen to help him    willingly   said the tailor   that s mere child s play    but he didn t take the huntsmen into the wood with him  and they were well enough pleased to remain behind  for the wild boar had often received them in a manner which did not make them desire its further acquaintance   as soon as the boar perceived the tailor it ran at him with foaming mouth and gleaming teeth  and tried to knock him down  but our alert little friend ran into a chapel that stood near  and got out of the window with a jump   the boar pursued him into the church  but the tailor skipped round to the door and closed it securely   so the raging beast was caught  for it was far too heavy and unwieldy to spring out of the window   the little tailor summoned the huntsmen together  that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes   then the hero betook himself to the king  who was obliged now  whether he liked it or not  to keep his promise  and hand him over his daughter and half his kingdom   had he known that no hero warrior  but only a little tailor  stood before him  it would have gone even more to his heart   so the wedding was celebrated with much splendor and little joy  and the tailor became a king   after a time the queen heard her husband saying one night in his sleep   my lad  make that waistcoat and patch these trousers  or i ll box your ears    thus she learned in what rank the young gentleman had been born  and next day she poured forth her woes to her father  and begged him to help her to get rid of a husband who was nothing more nor less than a tailor   the king comforted her  and said    leave your bedroom door open tonight  my servants shall stand outside  and when your husband is fast asleep they shall enter  bind him fast  and carry him on to a ship  which shall sail away out into the wide ocean    the queen was well satisfied with the idea  but the armor bearer  who had overheard everything  being much attached to his young master  went straight to him and revealed the whole plot    i ll soon put a stop to the business   said the tailor   that night he and his wife went to bed at the usual time  and when she thought he had fallen asleep she got up  opened the door  and then lay down again   the little tailor  who had only pretended to be asleep  began to call out in a clear voice   my lad  make that waistcoat and patch these trousers  or i ll box your ears   i have killed seven at a blow  slain two giants  led a unicorn captive  and caught a wild boar  then why should i be afraid of those men standing outside my door    the men  when they heard the tailor saying these words  were so terrified that they fled as if pursued by a wild army  and didn t dare go near him again   so the little tailor was and remained a king all the days of his life   the sleeping beauty in the wood  by charles perrault  there was once in a distant country a king and queen whose only sorrow was that they had no children   at last the queen gave birth to a little daughter and the king showed his joy by giving a christening feast so grand that the like of it was never known   he asked all the fairies in the land there were seven found in the kingdom to stand godmothers to the little princess  hoping that each might bestow on her some good gift   after the christening all the guests returned to the palace  where there was placed before each fairy godmother a magnificent covered dish  and a knife  fork  and spoon of pure gold  set with precious stones   but  as they all were sitting down at table there entered an old fairy who had not been invited  because it was more than fifty years since she had gone out of a certain tower  and she was thought to be dead or enchanted   the king ordered a cover to be placed for her  but it was of common earthenware  for he had ordered from his jeweler only seven gold dishes  for the seven fairies aforesaid   the old fairy thought herself neglected  and muttered angry threats  which were overheard by one of the younger fairies  who chanced to sit beside her  this good godmother  afraid of harm to the pretty baby  hastened to hide herself behind the hangings in the hall   she did this because she wished to speak last and repair any evil the old fairy might intend   the fairies now offered their good wishes  which  unlike most wishes  were sure to come true   the first wished that the little princess should grow up the fairest woman in the world  the second  that she should have wit like an angel  the third  that she should be perfectly graceful  the fourth  that she should sing like a nightingale  the fifth  that she should dance perfectly well  the sixth  that she should play all kinds of music perfectly   then the old fairy s turn came  shaking her head spitefully  she uttered the wish that when the baby grew up into a young lady  and learned to spin  she might prick her finger with a spindle and die of the wound   this terrible prophecy made all the company tremble  and every one fell to crying   upon which the wise young fairy appeared from behind the curtains and said   assure yourselves o king and queen  the princess shall not die   i have no power to undo what my elder has done   the princess must pierce her finger with a spindle and she shall then sink  not into the sleep of death  but into a sleep that will last a hundred years   after that time is ended  the son of a king shall come and awake her    then all the fairies vanished   the king  in the hope of avoiding his daughter s doom  issued an edict forbidding all persons to spin  and even to have spinning wheels in their houses  on pain of instant death   but it was in vain   one day when she was just fifteen years of age  the king and queen left their daughter alone in one of their castles  where  wandering about at her will  she came to a little room in the top of a tower  and there found a very old woman  who had not heard of the king s edict  busy with her spinning wheel    what are you doing  good old woman   said the princess    i m spinning my pretty child     ah  how pretty   let me try if i can spin also    she had no sooner taken up the spindle than  being hasty and unhandy  she pierced her finger with the point   though it was so small a wound  she fainted away at once and dropped on the floor   the poor old woman called for help  shortly came the ladies in waiting  who tried every means to restore their young mistress  but all in vain   she lay  beautiful as an angel  the color still lingering in her lips and cheeks  her fair bosom softly stirred with her breath  only her eyes were fast closed   when the king  her father  and the queen  her mother  beheld her thus  they knew that all had happened as the cruel fairy meant  and that their daughter would sleep for one hundred years  they sent away all the physicians and attendants  and themselves sorrowing laid her upon a bed in the finest apartment in the palace  there she slept and looked like a sleeping angel still   when this misfortune happened  the kindly young fairy who had saved the princess by changing her sleep of death into this sleep of a hundred years  was twelve thousand leagues away  in the kingdom of mataquin  but  being informed of everything by a little dwarf who wore seven  league boots  she arrived speedily in a chariot of fire drawn by dragons   the king handed her out of the chariot  and she approved of all he had done   then  being a fairy of great common sense and foresight  she thought that the princess  awakening after a hundred years in this old castle  might not know what to do with herself if she found herself alone   accordingly  she touched with her magic wand everybody and everything in the palace except the king and queen  governesses  ladies of honor  waiting maids  gentlemen ushers  cooks  kitchen girls  pages  footmen  even the horses that were in the stables  and the grooms that attended them  she touched each and all  nay  the dogs  too  in the outer court  and the little fat lapdog  mopsey  who had laid himself down beside his mistress on her splendid bed  were also touched  and they  like all the rest  fell fast asleep in a moment   the very spits that were before the kitchen fire fell asleep  and the fire itself  and everything became as still as if it were the middle of the night  or as if the palace were a palace of the dead   the king and queen  having kissed their daughter  went out of the castle  giving orders that it was to be approached no more   the command was unnecessary  for in one quarter of an hour there sprang up around it a wood so thick and thorny that neither beasts nor men could attempt to penetrate there   above this dense mass of forest could only be seen the top of the high tower where the lovely princess slept   when a hundred years were gone the king had died  and his throne had passed to another royal family   the reigning king s son  being one day out hunting  was stopped in the chase by this great wood  inquired what wood it was and what were those towers which he saw appearing out of the midst of it   every one answered as he had heard   some said it was an old castle haunted by spirits   others said it was the abode of witches and enchanters   the most common story was that an ogre lived there  a giant with long teeth and claws  who carried away naughty little boys and girls and ate them up   the prince did not know what to think   at length an old peasant was found who remembered having heard his grandfather say to his father that in this tower was a princess  beautiful as the day  who was doomed to sleep there for one hundred years  until awakened by a king s son  who was to marry her   at this the young prince  who had the spirit of a hero  determined to find out the truth for himself   spurred on by love and honor  he leaped from his horse and began to force his way through the thick wood   to his amazement the stiff branches all gave way  and the ugly thorns drew back of their own accord  and the brambles buried themselves in the earth to let him pass   this done  they closed behind him  allowing none to follow  nevertheless  he pushed boldly on alone   the first thing he saw was enough to freeze him with fear   bodies of men and horses lay extended on the ground  but the men had faces  not death white  but red as roses  and beside them were glasses half filled with wine  showing that they had gone to sleep drinking   next he entered a large court paved with marble  where stood rows of guards presenting arms  but as still as if cut out of stone  then he passed through many chambers where gentlemen and ladies  all in the dress of the past century  slept at their ease  some standing  some sitting  the pages were lurking in corners  the ladies of honor were stooping over their embroidery frames or listening to the gentlemen of the court  but all were as silent and as quiet as statues   their clothes  strange to say  were fresh and new as ever  and not a particle of dust or spider web had gathered over the furniture  though it had not known a broom for a hundred years   finally  the astonished prince came to an inner chamber  where was the fairest sight his eyes ever beheld   a young girl of wonderful beauty lay asleep on an embroidered bed  and she looked as if she had only just closed her eyes   trembling  the prince approached and knelt beside her   some say he kissed her  but as nobody saw it  and she never told  we cannot be quite sure of the fact  however  as the end of the enchantment had come  the princess waked at once  and  looking at him with eyes of the tenderest regard  said  sleepily   is it you  my prince   i have waited for you very long    charmed with these words  and still more by the tone in which they were uttered  the prince assured her that he loved her more than his life  for a long time did they sit talking  and yet had not said half enough  their only interruption was the little dog mopsey  who had awakened with his mistress  and now began to be jealous that the princess did not notice him as much as she was wont to do   meanwhile all the attendants  whose enchantment was also broken  not being in love  were ready to die of hunger after their fast of a hundred years   a lady of honor ventured to say that dinner was served  whereupon the prince handed his beloved princess at once to the great hall   she did not wait to dress for dinner  being already perfectly and magnificently attired  though in a fashion somewhat out of date  however  her lover had the politeness not to notice this  nor to remind her that she was dressed exactly like his grandmother whose portrait still hung on the palace walls   during dinner a concert by the attendant musicians took place  and  considering they had not touched their instruments for a century  they played the old tunes extremely well   they ended with a wedding march  for that very evening the prince and princess were married   after a few days they went together out of the castle and enchanted wood  both of which immediately vanished  and were nevermore beheld by mortal eyes   the princess was restored to her ancestral kingdom  and after a few years the prince and she became king and queen  and ruled long and happily    the fair one with golden locks  retold by miss mulock  there was once a king s daughter so beautiful that they named her the fair one with golden locks   these golden locks were the most remarkable in the world  soft and fine  and falling in long waves down to her very feet   she wore them always thus  loose and flowing  surmounted with a wreath of flowers  and though such long hair was sometimes rather inconvenient  it was so exceedingly beautiful  shining in the sun like ripples of molten gold  that everybody agreed she fully deserved her name   now there was a young king of a neighboring country  very handsome  very rich  and wanting nothing but a wife to make him happy   he heard so much of the various perfections of the fair one with golden locks  that at last  without even seeing her  he fell in love with her so desperately that he could neither eat nor drink  and resolved to send an ambassador at once to demand her in marriage   so he ordered a magnificent equipage more than a hundred horses and a hundred footmen  in order to bring back to him the fair one with golden locks  who  he never doubted  would be only too happy to become his queen   indeed  he felt so sure of her that he refurnished the whole palace  and had made by all the dressmakers of the city  dresses enough to last a lady a lifetime   but  alas  when the ambassador arrived and delivered his message  either the princess was in bad humor  or the offer did not appear to be to her taste  for she returned her best thanks to his majesty  but said she had not the slightest wish or intention to get married   she also  being a prudent damsel  declined receiving any of the presents which the king had sent her  except that  not quite to offend his majesty  she retained a box of english pins  which were in that country of considerable value   when the ambassador returned  alone and unsuccessful  all the court was very much affected  and the king himself began to weep with all his might   now  there was in the palace household a young gentleman named avenant  beautiful as the sun  besides being at once so amiable and so wise that the king confided to him all his affairs  and every one loved him  except those people to be found in all courts who were envious of his good fortune   these malicious folk hearing him say gaily   if the king had sent me to fetch the fair one with golden locks  i know she would have come back with me   repeated the saying in such a manner  that it appeared as if avenant thought so much of himself and his beauty  and felt sure the princess would have followed him all over the world  which when it came to the ears of the king  as it was meant to do  irritated him so much that he commanded avenant to be imprisoned in a high tower and left to die there of hunger   the guards accordingly carried off the young man  who had quite forgotten his idle speech  and had not the least idea what fault he had committed   they ill treated him very much  and then left him with nothing to eat and only water to drink   this  however  kept him alive for a few days  during which he did not cease to complain aloud  and to call upon the king  saying   oh king  what harm have i done   you have no subject more faithful than i  never have i had a thought which could offend you    and it so befell that the king  coming by chance  or else with a sort of remorse  past the tower  was touched by the voice of the young avenant  whom he had once so much regarded   in spite of all the courtiers could do to prevent him  he stopped to listen  and overheard these words   the tears rushed into his eyes  he opened the door of the tower  and called   avenant    avenant came  creeping feebly along  fell at the king s knees  and kissed his feet    oh sire  what have i done that you should treat me so cruelly     you have mocked me and my ambassador  for you said  if i had sent you to fetch the fair one with golden locks  you would have been successful and brought her back     i did say it  and it was true   replied avenant fearlessly   for i should have told her so much about your majesty and your various high qualities  which no one knows so well as myself  that i am persuaded she would have returned with me     i believe it   said the king  with an angry look at those who had spoken ill of his favorite  he then gave avenant a free pardon and took him back with him to the court   after having supplied the famished youth with as much supper as he could eat  the king admitted him to a private audience  and said   i am as much in love as ever with the fair one with golden locks  so i will take thee at thy word  and send thee to try and win her for me     very well  please your majesty  replied avenant cheerfully   i will depart to morrow    the king  overjoyed with his willingness and hopefulness would have furnished him with a still more magnificent equipage and suite than the first ambassador but avenant refused to take anything except a good horse to ride  and letters of introduction to the princess s father  the king embraced him and eagerly saw him depart   it was on a monday morning when  without any pomp or show  avenant thus started on his mission   he rode slowly and meditatively  pondering over every possible means of persuading the fair one with golden locks to marry the king  but  even after several days journey towards her country  no clear project had entered into his mind   one morning  when he had started at break of day  he came to a great meadow with a stream running through it  along which were planted willows and poplars   it was such a pleasant  rippling stream that he dismounted and sat down on its banks   there he perceived gasping on the grass a large golden carp  which  in leaping too far after gnats  had thrown itself quite out of the water  and now lay dying on the greensward   avenant took pity on it  and though he was very hungry  and the fish was very fat  and he would well enough have liked it for his breakfast  still he lifted it gently and put it back into the stream   no sooner had the carp touched the fresh cool water than it revived and swam away  but shortly returning  it spoke to him from the water in this wise    avenant  i thank you for your good deed   i was dying  and you have saved me  i will recompense you for this one day    after this pretty little speech  the fish popped down to the bottom of the stream  according to the habit of carp  leaving avenant very much astonished  as was natural   another day he met with a raven that was in great distress  being pursued by an eagle  which would have swallowed him up in no time   see   thought avenant   how the stronger oppress the weaker   what right has an eagle to eat up a raven    so taking his bow and arrow  which he always carried  he shot the eagle dead  and the raven  delighted  perched in safety on an opposite tree    avenant   screeched he  though not in the sweetest voice in the world   you have generously succored me  a poor miserable raven   i am not ungrateful  and i will recompense you one day     thank you   said avenant  and continued his road   entering in a thick wood  so dark with the shadows of early morning that he could scarcely find his way  he heard an owl hooting  like an owl in great tribulation   she had been caught by the nets spread by bird catchers to entrap finches  larks  and other small birds    what a pity   thought avenant   that men must always torment poor birds and beasts who have done them no harm    so he took out his knife  cut the net  and let the owl go free   she went sailing up in the air  but immediately returned hovering over his head on her brown wings    avenant   said she   at daylight the bird catchers would have been here  and i should have been caught and killed   i have a grateful heart  i will recompense you one day    these were the three principal adventures that befell avenant on his way to the kingdom of the fair one with golden locks   arrived there  he dressed himself with the greatest care  in a habit of silver brocade  and a hat adorned with plumes of scarlet and white   he threw over all a rich mantle  and carried a little basket  in which was a lovely little dog  an offering of respect to the princess   with this he presented himself at the palace gates  where even though he came alone  his mien was so dignified and graceful  so altogether charming  that every one did him reverence  and was eager to run and tell the fair one with golden locks  that avenant  another ambassador from the king  her suitor  awaited an audience    avenant   repeated the princess    that is a pretty name  perhaps the youth is pretty too     so beautiful   said the ladies of honor   that while he stood under the palace window we could do nothing but look at him     how silly of you   sharply said the princess   but she desired them to bring her robe of blue satin  to comb out her long hair  and adorn it with the freshest garland of flowers  to give her her high heeled shoes  and her fan    also   added she   take care that my audience  chamber is well swept and my throne well dusted   i wish in everything to appear as becomes the fair one with golden locks    this done she seated herself on her throne of ivory and ebony and gave orders for her musicians to play  but softly  so as not to disturb conversation   thus  shining in all her beauty  she admitted avenant to her presence   he was so dazzled that at first he could not speak  then he began and delivered his harangue to perfection    gentle avenant   returned the princess  after listening to all his reasons for her returning with him   your arguments are very strong  and i am inclined to listen to them  but you must first find for me a ring  which i dropped into the river about a month ago   until i recover it  i can listen to no proposition of marriage    avenant  surprised and disturbed  made her a profound reverence and retired  taking with him the basket and the little dog cabriole  which she refused to accept   all night long he sat sighing to himself    how can i ever find a ring which she dropped into the river a month ago  she has set me an impossibility     my dear master   said cabriole   nothing is an impossibility to one so young and charming as you are  let us go at daybreak to the river  side    avenant patted him  but replied nothing  until  worn out with grief  he slept   before dawn cabriole wakened him  saying   master  dress yourself and let us go to the river    there avenant walked up and down  with his arms folded and his head bent  but saw nothing   at last he heard a voice  calling from a distance   avenant  avenant    the little dog ran to the water side    never believe me again  master  if it is not a golden carp with a ring in its mouth     yes  avenant   said the carp   this is the ring which the princess has lost   you saved my life in the willow meadow  and i have recompensed you   farewell    avenant took the ring gratefully and returned to the palace with cabriole  who scampered about in great glee   craving an audience  he presented the princess with her ring  and begged her to accompany him to his master s kingdom   she took the ring  looked at it  and thought she was surely dreaming    some fairy must have assisted you  fortunate avenant   said she    madam  i am only fortunate in my desire to obey your wishes     obey me still   she said graciously    there is a prince named galifron  whose suit i have refused   he is a giant as tall as a tower  who eats a man as a monkey eats a nut  he puts cannons into his pockets instead of pistols  and when he speaks  his voice is so loud that every one near him becomes deaf   go and fight him  and bring me his head    avenant was thunderstruck  but after a time he recovered himself   very well  madam  i shall certainly perish  but i will perish like a brave man   i will depart at once to fight the giant galifron    the princess  now in her turn surprised and alarmed  tried every persuasion to induce him not to go  but in vain   avenant armed himself and started  carrying his little dog in its basket   cabriole was the only creature that gave him consolation   courage  master   while you attack the giant  i will bite his legs  he will stoop down to strike me  and then you can knock him on the head    avenant smiled at the little dog s spirit  but he knew it was useless   arrived at the castle of galifron  he found the road all strewn with bones  and carcasses of men   soon he saw the giant walking   his head was level with the highest trees  and he sang in a terrific voice     bring me babies to devour   more more more more   men and women  tender and tough   all the world holds not enough     to which avenant replied  imitating the tune     avenant you here may see   he is come to punish thee   be he tender  be he tough   to kill thee  giant  he is enough     hearing these words  the giant took up his massive club  looked around for the singer  and perceiving him  would have slain him on the spot  had not a raven  sitting on a tree close by  suddenly flown out upon him and picked out both his eyes   then avenant easily killed him and cut off his head  while the raven  watching him  said    you shot the eagle who was pursuing me  i promised to recompense you  and to day i have done it   we are quits     no  it is i who am your debtor  sir raven   replied avenant  as  hanging the frightful head to his saddle bow  he mounted his horse and rode back to the city of the fair one with golden locks   there everybody followed him  shouting   here is brave avenant  who has killed the giant   until the princess  hearing the noise  and fearing it was avenant himself who was killed  appeared  all trembling  and even when he appeared with galifron s head  she trembled still  although she had nothing to fear    madam   said avenant   your enemy is dead  so i trust you will accept the hand of the king my master     i cannot   replied she thoughtfully   unless you first bring me a phial of the water in the grotto of darkness   it is six leagues in length  and guarded at the entrance by two fiery dragons   within  it is a pit  full of scorpions  lizards  and serpents  and at the bottom of this place flows the fountain of beauty and health   all who wash in it become  if ugly  beautiful  and if beautiful  beautiful forever  if old  young  and if young  young forever   judge then  avenant  if i can quit my kingdom without carrying with me some of this miraculous water     madam   replied avenant   you are already so beautiful that you require it not  but i am an unfortunate ambassador whose death you desire  i will obey you  though i know i shall never return    so he departed with his only friends his horse and his faithful dog cabriole  while all who met him looked at him compassionately  pitying so pretty a youth bound on such a hopeless errand   but  however kindly they addressed him  avenant rode on and answered nothing  for he was too sad at heart   he reached a mountain side  where he sat down to rest  leaving his horse to graze  and cabriole to run after the flies   he knew that the grotto of darkness was not far off  yet he looked about him like one who sees nothing   at last he perceived a rock  as black as ink  whence came a thick smoke  and in a moment appeared one of the two dragons  breathing out flames   it had a yellow and green body  claws  and a long tail   when cabriole saw the monster  the poor little dog hid himself in terrible fright   but avenant resolved to die bravely  so taking a phial which the princess had given him  he prepared to descend into the cave    cabriole   said he   i shall soon be dead  then fill this phial with my blood  and carry it to the fair one with golden locks  and afterward to the king  my master  to show him i have been faithful to the last    while he was thus speaking a voice called   avenant  avenant   and he saw an owl sitting on a hollow tree   said the owl   you cut the net in which i was caught  and i vow to recompense you   now is the time  give me the phial  i know every corner of the grotto of darkness i will fetch you the water of beauty    delighted beyond words  avenant delivered up his phial  the owl flew with it into the grotto  and in less than half an hour reappeared  bringing it quite full and well corked   avenant thanked her with all his heart  and joyfully took once more the road to the city   the fair one with golden locks had no more to say   she consented to accompany him back  with all her suite  to his master s court   on the way thither she saw so much of him  and found him so charming  that avenant might have married her himself had he chosen  but he would not have been false to his master for all the beauties under the sun   at length they arrived at the king s city  and the fair one with golden locks became his spouse and queen   but she still loved avenant in her heart  and often said to the king her lord   but for avenant i should not be here  he has done all sorts of impossible deeds for my sake  he has fetched me the water of beauty  and i shall never grow old in short  i owe him everything    and she praised him in this sort so much that at length the king became jealous  and though ayenant gave him not the slightest cause of offense  he shut him up in the same high tower once more but with irons on his hands and feet  and a cruel jailer besides  who fed him with bread and water only   his sole companion was his little dog cabriole   when the fair one with golden locks heard of this  she reproached her husband for his ingratitude  and then throwing herself at his knees  implored that avenant might be set free   but the king only said   she loves him   and refused her prayer   the queen entreated no more  but fell into a deep melancholy   when the king saw it  he thought she did not care for him because he was not handsome enough  and that if he could wash his face with her water of beauty  it would make her love him the more   he knew that she kept it in a cabinet in her chamber  where she could find it always   now it happened that a waiting maid  in cleaning out this cabinet  had  the very day before  knocked down the phial  which was broken in a thousand pieces  and all the contents were lost   very much alarmed  she then remembered seeing  in a cabinet belonging to the king  a similar phial   this she fetched  and put in the place of the other one  in which was the water of beauty   but the king s phial contained the water of death   it was a poison  used to destroy great criminals  that is  noblemen  gentlemen  and such like   instead of hanging them or cutting their heads off  like common people  they were compelled to wash their faces with this water  upon which they fell asleep  and woke no more   so it happened that the king  taking up this phial  believing it to be the water of beauty  washed his face with it  fell asleep  and died   cabriole heard the news  and  gliding in and out among the crowd which clustered round the young and lovely widow  whispered softly to her   madam  do not forget poor avenant    if she had been disposed to do so  the sight of his little dog would have been enough to remind her of him his many sufferings  and his great fidelity   she rose up  without speaking to anybody  and went straight to the tower where avenant was confined   there  with her own hands  she struck off his chains  and putting a crown of gold on his head  and a purple mantle on his shoulders  said to him   be king  and my husband   avenant could not refuse  for in his heart he had loved her all the time   he threw himself at her feet  and then took the crown and scepter  and ruled her kingdom like a king   all the people were delighted to have him as their sovereign   the marriage was celebrated in all imaginable pomp  and avenant and the fair one with golden locks lived and reigned happily together all their days    beauty and the beast  by mme  d aulnoy  there was once a very rich merchant  who had six children  three boys and three girls   as he was himself a man of great sense  he spared no expense for their education   the three daughters were all handsome  but particularly the youngest  indeed  she was so very beautiful  that in her childhood everyone called her the little beauty  and being equally lovely when she was grown up  nobody called her by any other name  which made her sisters very jealous of her   this youngest daughter was not only more handsome than her sisters  but also was better tempered   the two eldest were vain of their wealth and position   they gave themselves a thousand airs  and refused to visit other merchants  daughters  nor would they condescend to be seen except with persons of quality   they went every day to balls  p1ays  and public walks  and always made game of their youngest sister for spending her time in reading or other useful employments   as it was well known that these young ladies would have large fortunes  many great merchants wished to get them for wives  but the two eldest always answered  that  for their parts  they had no thoughts of marrying anyone below a duke or an earl at least   beauty had quite as many offers as her sisters  but she always answered  with the greatest civility  that though she was much obliged to her lovers  she would rather live some years longer with her father  as she thought herself too young to marry   it happened that  by some unlucky accident  the merchant suddenly lost all his fortune  and had nothing left but a small cottage in the country   upon this he said to his daughters  while the tears ran down his cheeks   my children  we must now go and dwell in the cottage  and try to get a living by labor  for we have no other means of support   the two eldest replied that they did not know how to work  and would not leave town  for they had lovers enough who would be glad to marry them  though they had no longer any fortune   but in this they were mistaken  for when the lovers heard what had happened  they said   the girls were so proud and ill tempered  that all we wanted was their fortune  we are not sorry at all to see their pride brought down  let them show off their airs to their cows and sheep    but everybody pitied poor beauty  because she was so sweet tempered and kind to all  and several gentlemen offered to marry her  though she had not a penny  but beauty still refused  and said she could not think of leaving her poor father in this trouble   at first beauty could not help sometimes crying in secret for the hardships she was now obliged to suffer  but in a very short time she said to herself   all the crying in the world will do me no good  so i will try to be happy without a fortune    when they had removed to their cottage  the merchant and his three sons employed themselves in ploughing and sowing the fields  and working in the garden   beauty also did her part  for she rose by four o clock every morning  lighted the fires  cleaned the house  and got ready the breakfast for the whole family   at first she found all this very hard  but she soon grew quite used to it  and thought it no hardship  indeed  the work greatly benefited her health   when she had done  she used to amuse herself with reading  playing her music  or singing while she spun   but her two sisters were at a loss what to do to pass the time away  they had their breakfast in bed  and did not rise till ten o clock   then they commonly walked out  but always found themselves very soon tired  when they would often sit down under a shady tree  and grieve for the loss of their carriage and fine clothes  and say to each other   what a mean spirited  poor stupid creature our young sister is  to be so content within this low way of life    but their father thought differently  and loved and admired his youngest child more than ever   after they had lived in this manner about a year the merchant received a letter  which informed him that one of his richest ships  which he thought was lost  had just come unto port   this news made the two eldest sisters almost mad with joy  for they thought they should now leave the cottage  and have all their finery again   when they found that their father must take a journey to the ship  the two eldest begged he would not fail to bring them back some new gowns  caps  rings  and all sorts of trinkets   but beauty asked for nothing  for she thought in herself that all the ship was worth would hardly buy everything her sisters wished for    beauty   said the merchant   how comes it that you ask for nothing  what can i bring you  my child     since you are so kind as to think of me  dear father   she answered   i should be glad if you would bring me a rose  for we have none in our garden    now beauty did not indeed wish for a rose  nor anything else  but she only said this that she might not affront her sisters  otherwise they would have said she wanted her father to praise her for desiring nothing   the merchant took his leave of them  and set out on his journey  but when he got to the ship  some persons went to law with him about the cargo  and after a deal of trouble he came back to his cottage as poor as he had left it   when he was within thirty miles of his home  and thinking of the joy of again meeting his children  he lost his way in the midst of a dense forest   it rained and snowed very hard  and  besides  the wind was so high as to throw him twice from his horse   night came on  and he feared he should die of cold and hunger  or be torn to pieces by the wolves that he heard howling round him  all at once  he cast his eyes toward a long avenue  and saw at the end a light  but it seemed a great way off   he made the best of his way toward it  and found that it came from a splendid palace  the windows of which were all blazing with light   it had great bronze gates  standing wide open  and fine court yards  through which the merchant passed  but not a living soul was to be seen   there were stables  too  which his poor  starved horse  less scrupulous than himself  entered at once  and took a good meal of oats and hay   his master then tied him up  and walked toward the entrance hall  but still without seeing a single creature   he went on to a large dining parlor  where he found a good fire  and table covered with some very nice dishes  but only one plate with a knife and fork   as the snow and rain had wetted him to the skin  he went up to the fire to dry himself    i hope   said he   the master of the house or his servants will excuse me  for it surely will not be long now before i see them    he waited some time  but still nobody came  at last the clock struck eleven  and the merchant  being quite faint for the want of food  helped himself to a chicken  and to a few glasses of wine  yet all the time trembling with fear   he sat till the clock struck twelve  and then  taking courage  began to think he might as well look about him  so he opened a door at the end of the hall  and went through it into a very grand room  in which there was a fine bed  and as he was feeling very weary  he shut the door  took off his clothes  and got into it   it was ten o clock in the morning before he awoke  when he was amazed to see a handsome new suit of clothes laid ready for him  instead of his own  which were all torn and spoiled    to be sure   said he to himself   this place belongs to some good fairy  who has taken pity on my ill luck    he looked out of the window  and instead of the snow  covered wood  where he had lost himself the previous night  he saw the most charming arbors covered with all kinds of flowers   returning to the hall where he had supper  he found a breakfast table  ready prepared    indeed  my good fairy   said the merchant aloud   i am vastly obliged to you for your kind care of me    he then made a hearty breakfast  took his hat  and was going to the stable to pay his horse a visit  but as he passed under one of the arbors  which was loaded with roses  he thought of what beauty had asked him to bring back to her  and so he took a bunch of roses to carry home   at the same moment he heard a loud noise  and saw coming toward him a beast  so frightful to look at that he was ready to faint with fear    ungrateful man   said the beast in a terrible voice   i have saved your life by admitting you into my palace  and in return you steal my roses  which i value more than anything i possess   but you shall atone for your fault die in a quarter of an hour   the merchant fell on his knees  and clasping his hands  said   sir  i humbly beg your pardon  i did not think it would offend you to gather a rose for one of my daughters  who had entreated me to bring her one home   do not kill me  my lord     i am not a lord  but a beast   replied   the monster   i hate false compliments  so do not fancy that you can coax me by any such ways  you tell me that you have daughters  now i will suffer you to escape  if one of them will come and die in your stead   if not  profuse that you will yourself return in three months  to be dealt with as i may choose    the tender hearted merchant had no thoughts of letting any one of his daughters die for his sake  but he knew that if he seemed to accept the beast s terms  he should at least have the pleasure of seeing them once again   so he gave his promise  and was told that he might then set off as soon as he liked    but   said the beast   i do not wish you to go back empty handed   go to the room you slept in  and you will find a chest there  fill it with whatsoever you like best  and i will have it taken to your own house for you    when the beast had said this  he went away   the good merchant  left to himself  began to consider that as he must die for he had no thought of breaking a promise  made even to a beast he might as well have the comfort of leaving his children provided for   he returned to the room he had slept in  and found there heaps of gold pieces lying about   he filled the chest with them to the very brim  locked it  and  mounting his horse  left the palace as sorrowful as he had been glad when he first beheld it   the horse took a path across the forest of his own accord  and in a few hours they reached the merchant s house  his children came running round him  but  instead of kissing them with joy  he could not help weeping as he looked at them   he held in his hand the bunch of roses  which he gave to beauty  saying   take these roses  beauty  but little do you think how dear they have cost your poor father   and then he gave them an account of all that he had seen or heard in the palace of the beast   the two eldest sisters now began to shed tears  and to lay the blame upon beauty  who  they said  would be the cause of her father s death   see   said they   what happens from the pride of the little wretch  why did not she ask for such things as we did   but  to be sure  miss must not be like other people  and though she will be the cause of her father s death  yet she does not shed a tear     it would be useless   replied beauty   for my father shall not die  as the beast will accept one of his daughters  i will give myself up  and be only too happy to prove my love for the best of fathers     no  sister   said the three brothers with one voice   that cannot be  we will go in search of this monster  and either he or we will perish     do not hope to kill him   said the merchant   his power is far too great   but beauty s young life shall not be sacrificed  i am old  and cannot expect to live much longer  so i shall but give up a few years of my life  and shall only grieve for the sake of my children     never  father   cried beauty   if you go back to the palace  you cannot hinder my going after you  though young  i am not over fond of life  and i would much rather be eaten up by the monster  than die of grief for your loss    the merchant in vain tried to reason with beauty who still obstinately kept to her purpose  which  in truth  made her two sisters glad  for they were jealous of her  because everybody loved her   the merchant was so grieved at the thoughts of losing his child  that he never once thought of the chest filled with gold  but at night  to his great surprise  he found it standing by his bedside   he said nothing about his riches to his eldest daughters  for he knew very well it would at once make them want to return to town  but he told beauty his secret  and she then said  that while he was away  two gentlemen had been on a visit at her cottage  who had fallen in love with her two sisters   she entreated her father to marry them without delay  for she was so sweet natured  she only wished them to be happy   three months went by  only too fast  and then the merchant and beauty got ready to set out for the palace of the beast   upon this  the two sisters rubbed their eyes with an onion  to make believe they were crying  both the merchant and his sons cried in earnest   only beauty shed no tears   they reached the palace in a very few hours  and the horse  without bidding  went into the stable as before   the merchant and beauty walked toward the large hall  where they found a table covered with every dainty and two plates laid already   the merchant had very little appetite  but beauty  that she might the better hide her grief  placed herself at the table  and helped her father  she then began to eat herself  and thought all the time that  to be sure  the beast had a mind to fatten her before he ate her up  since he had provided such good cheer for her   when they had done their supper  they heard a great noise  and the good old man began to bid his poor child farewell  for he knew it was the beast coming to them   when beauty first saw that frightful form  she was very much terrified  but tried to hide her fear   the creature walked up to her  and eyed her all over then asked her in a dreadful voice if she had come quite of her own accord    yes   said beauty    then you are a good girl  and i am very much obliged to you    this was such an astonishingly civil answer that beauty s courage rose  but it sank again when the beast  addressing the merchant  desired him to leave the palace next morning  and never return to it again    and so good night  merchant   and good night  beauty     good night  beast   she answered  as the monster shuffled out of the room    ah   my dear child   said the merchant  kissing his daughter   i am half dead already  at the thought of leaving you with this dreadful beast  you shall go back and let me stay in your place     no   said beauty  boldly   i will never agree to that  you must go home to morrow morning    they then wished each other good night  and went to bed  both of them thinking they should not be able to close their eyes  but as soon as ever they had lain down  they fell into a deep sleep  and did not awake till morning   beauty dreamed that a lady came up to her  who said   i am very much pleased  beauty  with the goodness you have shown  in being willing to give your life to save that of your father   do not be afraid of anything  you shall not go without a reward    as soon as beauty awoke she told her father this dream  but though it gave him some comfort  he was a long time before he could be persuaded to leave the palace   at last beauty succeeded in getting him safely away   when her father was out of sight  poor beauty began to weep sorely  still  having naturally a courageous spirit  she soon resolved not to make her sad case still worse by sorrow  which she knew was vain  but to wait and be patient   she walked about to take a view of all the palace  and the elegance of every part of it much charmed her   but what was her surprise  when she came to a door on which was written  beauty s room   she opened it in haste  and her eyes were dazzled by the splendor and taste of the apartment   what made her wonder more than all the rest  was a large library filled with books  a harpsichord  and many pieces of music    the beast surely does not mean to eat me up immediately   said she   since he takes care i shall not be at a loss how to amuse myself    she opened the library and saw these verses written in letters of gold in the back of one of the books    beauteous lady  dry your tears   here s no cause for sighs or fears   command as freely as you may   for you command and i obey      alas   said she  sighing   i wish i could only command a sight of my poor father  and to know what he is doing at this moment    just then  by chance  she cast her eyes upon a looking glass that stood near her  and in it she saw a picture of her old home  and her father riding mournfully up to the door   her sisters came out to meet him  and although they tried to look sorry  it was easy to see that in their hearts they were very glad   in a short time all this picture disappeared  but it caused beauty to think that the beast  besides being very powerful  was also very kind   about the middle of the day she found a table laid ready for her  and a sweet concert of music played all the time she was dining  without her seeing anybody   but at supper  when she was going to seat herself at table  she heard the noise of the beast  and could not help trembling with fear    beauty   said he   will you give me leave to see you sup     that is as you please   answered she  very much afraid    not in the least   said the beast   you alone command in this place  if you should not like my company  you need only say so  and i will leave you that moment   but tell me  beauty  do you not think me very ugly      why  yes   said she   for i cannot tell a falsehood  but then i think you are very good     am i   sadly replied the beast   yet  besides being ugly  i am also very stupid  i know well enough that i am but a beast     very stupid people   said beauty   are never aware of it themselves    at which kindly speech the beast looked pleased  and replied  not without an awkward sort of politeness   pray do not let me detain you from supper  and be sure that you are well served   all you see is your own  and i should be deeply grieved if you wanted for anything     you are very kind so kind that i almost forgot you are so ugly   said beauty  earnestly    ah  yes   answered the beast  with a great sigh   i hope i am good  tempered  but still i am only a monster     there is many a monster who wears the form of a man  it is better of the two to have the heart of a man and the form of a monster     i would thank you  beauty  for this speech  but i am too senseless to say anything that would please you   returned the beast in a melancholy voice  and altogether he seemed so gentle and so unhappy that beauty  who had the tenderest heart in the world  felt her fear of him gradually vanish   she ate her supper with a good appetite  and conversed in her own sensible and charming way  till at last  when the beast rose to depart  he terrified her more than ever by saying abruptly  in his gruff voice   beauty  will you marry me    now beauty  frightened as she was  would speak only the exact truth  besides her father had told her that the beast liked only to have the truth spoken to him   so she answered  in a very firm tone   no  beast    he did not get into a passion  or do anything but sigh deeply  and depart   when beauty found herself alone  she began to feel pity for the poor beast    oh   said she   what a sad thing it is that he should be so very frightful  since he is so good tempered    beauty lived three months in this palace very well pleased   the beast came to see her every night  and talked with her while she supped  and though what he said was not very clever  yet  as she saw in him every day some new goodness  instead of dreading the time of his coming  she soon began continually looking at her watch  to see if it were nine o clock  for that was the hour when he never failed to visit her   one thing only vexed her  which was that every night before he went away  he always made it a rule to ask her if she would be his wife  and seemed very much grieved at her steadfastly replying  no    at last  one night  she said to him   you wound me greatly  beast  by forcing me to refuse you so often  i wish i could take such a liking to you as to agree to marry you  but i must tell you plainly that i do not think it will ever happen   i shall always be your friend  so try to let that content you    i must   sighed the beast   for i know well enough how frightful i am  but i love you better than myself   yet i think i am very lucky in your being pleased to stay with me  now promise  beauty  that you will never leave me   beauty would almost have agreed to this  so sorry was she for him  but she had that day seen in her magic glass  which she looked at constantly  that her father was dying of grief for her sake    alas   she said   i long so much to see my father  that if you do not give me leave to visit him  i shall break my heart     i would rather break mine  beauty   answered the beast   i will send you to your father s cottage  you shall stay there  and your poor beast shall die of sorrow     no   said beauty  crying   i love you too well to be the cause of your death  i promise to return in a week   you have shown me that my sisters are married  and my brothers are gone for soldiers  so that my father is left all alone   let me stay a week with him     you shall find yourself with him to morrow morning   replied the beast   but mind  do not forget your promise   when you wish to return  you have nothing to do but to put your ring on a table when you go to bed   good by  beauty    the beast sighed as he said these words  and beauty went to bed very sorry to see him so much grieved   when she awoke in the morning  she found herself in her father s cottage   she rang a bell that was at her bedside  and a servant entered  but as soon as she saw beauty the woman gave a loud shriek  upon which the merchant ran upstairs  and when he beheld his daughter he ran to her  and kissed her a hundred times   at last beauty began to remember that she had brought no clothes with her to put on  but the servant told her she had just found in the next room a large chest full of dresses  trimmed all over with gold  and adorned within pearls and diamonds   beauty  in her own mind  thanked the beast for his kindness  and put on the plainest gown she could find among them all   she then desired the servant to lay the rest aside  for she intended to give them to her sisters  but  as soon as she had spoken these words  the chest was gone out of sight in a moment   her father then suggested  perhaps the beast chose for her to keep them all for herself  and as soon as he had said this  they saw the chest standing again in the same place   while beauty was dressing herself  a servant brought word to her that her sisters were come with their husbands to pay her a visit   they both lived unhappily with the gentlemen they had married   the husband of the eldest was very handsome  but was so proud of this that he thought of nothing else from morning till night  and did not care a pin for the beauty of his wife   the second had married a man of great learning  but he made no use of it  except to torment and affront all his friends  and his wife more than any of them   the two sisters were ready to burst with spite when they saw beauty dressed like a princess  and looking so very charming   all the kindness that she showed them was of no use  for they were vexed more than ever when she told them how happy she lived at the palace of the beast   the spiteful creatures went by themselves into the garden  where they cried to think of her good fortune    why should the little wretch be better off than we   said they    we are much handsomer than she is     sister   said the eldest   a thought has just come into my head  let us try to keep her here longer than the week for which the beast gave her leave  and then he will be so angry that perhaps when she goes back to him he will eat her up in a moment      that is well thought of   answered the other   but to do this  we must pretend to be very kind    they then went to join her in the cottage  where they showed her so much false love that beauty could not help crying for joy   when the week was ended  the two sisters began to pretend such grief at the thought of her leaving them that she agreed to stay a week more  but all that time beauty could not help fretting for the sorrow that she knew her absence would give her poor beast for she tenderly loved him  and much wished for his company again   among all the grand and clever people she saw  she found nobody who was half so sensible  so affectionate  so thoughtful  or so kind   the tenth night of her being at the cottage  she dreamed she was in the garden of the palace  that the beast lay dying on a grass plot  and with his last breath put her in mind of her promise  and laid his death to her forsaking him  beauty awoke in a great fright  and she burst into tears    am not i wicked   said she   to behave so ill to a beast who has shown me so much kindness   why will i not marry him   i am sure i should be more happy with him than my sisters are with their husbands   he shall not be wretched any longer on my account  for i should do nothing but blame myself all the rest of my life    she then rose  put her ring on the table  got into bed again  and soon fell asleep   in the morning she with joy found herself in the palace of the beast   she dressed herself very carefully  that she might please him the better  and thought she had never known a day pass away so slowly   at last the clock struck nine  but the beast did not come  beauty  dreading lest she might truly have caused his death  ran from room to room  calling out   beast  dear beast   but there was no answer   at last she remembered her dream  rushed to the grass plot  and there saw him lying apparently dead beside the fountain  forgetting all his ugliness  she threw herself upon his body  and finding his heart still beating  she fetched some water and sprinkled it over him  weeping and sobbing the while   the beast opened his eyes    you forgot your promise  beauty  and so i determined to die  for i could not live without you   i have starved myself to death  but i shall die content since i have seen your face once more     no  dear beast   cried beauty  passionately   you shall not die  you shall live to be my husband   i thought it was only friendship i felt for you  but now i know it was love    the moment beauty had spoken these words  the palace was suddenly lighted up  and all kinds of rejoicings were heard around them  none of which she noticed  but hung over her dear beast with the utmost tenderness   at last  unable to restrain herself  she dropped her head over her hands  covered her eyes  and cried for joy  and  when she looked up again  the beast was gone   in his stead she saw at her feet a handsome  graceful young prince  who thanked her with the tenderest expressions for having freed him from enchantment    but where is my poor beast   i only want him and nobody else   sobbed beauty    i am he   replied the prince    a wicked fairy condemned me to this form  and forbade me to show that i had any wit or sense  till a beautiful lady should consent to marry me   you alone  dearest beauty  judged me neither by my looks nor by my talents  but by my heart alone  take it then  and all that i have besides  for all is yours    beauty  full of surprise  but very happy  suffered the prince to lead her to his palace  where she found her father and sisters  who had been brought there by the fairy lady whom she had seen in a dream the first night she came    beauty   said the fairy   you have chosen well  and you have your reward  for a true heart is better than either good looks or clever brains   as for you  ladies   and she turned to the two elder sisters   i know all your ill deeds  but i have no worse punishment for you than to see your sister happy   you shall stand as statues at the door of her palace  and when you repent of  and have amended your faults  you shall become women again   but  to tell you the truth  i very much fear you will remain statues forever     jack and the beanstalk  anonymous  once upon a time there was a poor widow who lived in a little cottage with her only son jack   jack was a giddy  thoughtless boy  but very kindhearted and affectionate   there had been a hard winter  and after it the poor woman had suffered from fever and ague   jack did no work as yet  and by degrees they grew dreadfully poor   the widow saw that there was no means of keeping jack and herself from starvation but by selling her cow  so one morning she said to her son   i am too weak to go myself  jack  so you must take the cow to market for me  and sell her    jack liked going to market to sell the cow very much  but as he was on his way  he met a butcher who had some beautiful beans in his hand  jack stopped to look at them  and the butcher told the boy that they were of great value  and persuaded the silly lad to sell the cow for these beans   when he brought them home to his mother instead of the money she expected for her nice cow  she was very vexed and shed many tears  scolding jack for his folly   he was very sorry  and mother and son went to bed very sadly that night  their last hope seemed gone   at daybreak jack rose and went out into the garden    at least   he thought   i will sow the wonderful beans   mother says that they are just common scarlet runners  and nothing else  but i may as well sow them    so he took a piece of stick  and made some holes in the ground  and put in the beans   that day they had very little dinner  and went sadly to bed  knowing that for the next day there would be none  and jack  unable to sleep from grief and vexation  got up at day dawn and went out into the garden   what was his amazement to find that the beans had grown up in the night  and climbed up and up till they covered the high cliff that sheltered the cottage  and disappeared above it   the stalks had twined and   twisted themselves together till they formed quite a ladder    it would be easy to climb it   thought jack   and  having thought of the experiment  he at once resolved to carry it out  for jack was a good climber   however  after his late mistake about the cow  he thought he had better consult his mother first   so jack called his mother  and they both gazed in silent wonder at the beanstalk  which was not only of great height  but it was thick enough to bear jack s weight    i wonder where it ends   said jack to his mother   i think i will climb up and see    his mother wished him not to venture up this strange ladder  but jack coaxed her to give her consent to the attempt  for he was certain there must be something wonderful in the beanstalk  so at last she yielded to his wishes   jack instantly began to climb  and went up and up on the ladder like bean till everything he had left behind him the cottage  the village  and even the tall church tower looked quite little  and still he could not see the top of the beanstalk   jack felt a little tired  and thought for a moment that he would go back again  but he was a very persevering boy  and he knew that the way to succeed in anything is not to give up   so  after resting for a moment  he went on   after climbing higher and higher  till he grew afraid to look down for fear he should be giddy  jack at last reached the top of the beanstalk  and found himself in a beautiful country  finely wooded  with beautiful meadows covered with sheep   a crystal stream ran through the pastures  not far from the place where he had got off the beanstalk stood a fine  strong castle   jack wondered very much that he had never heard of or seen this castle before  but when he reflected on the subject  he saw that it was as much separated from the village by the perpendicular rock on which it stood as if it were in another land   while jack was standing looking at the castle  a very strange looking woman came out of the wood and advanced toward him   she wore a pointed cap of quilted red satin turned up with ermine  her hair streamed loose over her shoulders  and she walked with a staff  jack took off his cap and made her a bow    if you please  ma am   said he   is this your house     no   said the old lady    listen  and i will tell you the story of that castle     once upon a time there was a noble knight  who lived in this castle  which is on the borders of fairyland   he had a fair and beloved wife and several lovely children  and as his neighbors  the little people  were very friendly toward him  they bestowed on him many excellent and precious gifts    rumor whispered of these treasures  and a monstrous giant who lived at a great distance  and who was a very wicked being  resolved to obtain possession of them    so he bribed a false servant to let him inside the castle  when the knight was in bed and asleep  and he killed him as he lay   then he went to the part of the castle which was the nursery  and also killed all the poor little ones he found there    happily for her  the lady was not to be found   she had gone with her infant son  who was only two or three months old  to visit her old nurse  who lived in the valley  and she had been detained all night there by a storm    the next morning  as soon as it was light  one of the servants at the castle  who had managed to escape  came to tell the poor lady of the sad fate of her husband and her pretty babes   she could scarcely believe him at first  and was eager at once to go back and share the fate of her dear ones  but the old nurse  with many tears  besought her to remember that she had still a child  and that it was her duty to preserve her life for the sake of the poor innocent    the lady yielded to this reasoning  and consented to remain at her nurse s house as the best place of concealment  for the servant told her that the giant had vowed  if he could find her  he would kill both her and her baby   years rolled on   the old nurse died  leaving her cottage and the few articles of furniture it contained to her poor lady  who dwelt in it  working as a peasant for her daily bread   her spinning wheel and the milk of a cow which she had purchased with the little money she had with her  sufficed for the scanty subsistence of herself and her little son   there was a nice little garden attached to the cottage  in which they cultivated peas  beans  and cabbages  and the lady was not ashamed to go out at harvest time and glean in the fields to supply her little son s wants    jack  that poor lady is your mother   this castle was once your father s  and must again be yours   jack uttered a cry of surprise    my mother   oh  madam  what ought i to do   my poor father   my dear mother     your duty requires you to win it back for your mother   but the task is a very difficult one  and full of peril  jack   have you courage to undertake it     i fear nothing when i am doing right   said jack    then   said the lady in the red cap   you are one of those who slay giants   you must get into the castle  and if possible possess yourself of a hen that lays golden eggs  and a harp that talks   remember  all the giant possesses is really yours    as she ceased speaking  the lady of the red hat suddenly disappeared  and of course jack knew she was a fairy   jack determined at once to attempt the adventure  so he advanced  and blew the horn which hung at the castle portal   the door was opened in a minute or two by a frightful giantess  with one great eye in the middle of her forehead   as soon as jack saw her he turned to run away  but she caught him  and dragged him into the castle    ho  ho   she laughed terribly    you didn t expect to see me here  that is clear   no  i shan t let you go again   i am weary of my life  i am so overworked  and i don t see why i should not have a page as well as other ladies   and you shall be my boy   you shall clean the knives  and black the boots  and make the fires  and help me generally when the giant is out   when he is at home i must hide you  for he has eaten up all my pages hitherto  and you would be a dainty morsel  my little lad    while she spoke she dragged jack right into the castle   the poor boy was very much frightened  as i am sure you and i would have been in his place   but he remembered that fear disgraces a man  so he struggled to be brave and make the best of things    i am quite ready to help you  and do all i can to serve you  madam   he said   only i beg you will be good enough to hide me from your husband  for i should not like to be eaten at all     that s a good boy   said the giantess  nodding her head   it is lucky for you that you did not scream out when you saw me  as the other boys who have been here did  for if you had done so my husband would have awakened and have eaten you  as he did them  for breakfast   come here  child  go into my wardrobe  he never ventures to open that  you will be safe there    and she opened a huge wardrobe which stood in the great hall  and shut him unto it   but the keyhole was so large that it admitted plenty of air  and he could see everything that took place through it   by and by he heard a heavy tramp on the stairs  like the lumbering along of a great cannon  and then a voice like thunder cried out     fe  fa  fi fo fum   i smell the breath of an englishman   let him be alive or let him be dead   i ll grind his bones to make my bread      wife   cried the giant   there is a man in the castle   let me have him for breakfast     you are grown old and stupid   cried the lady  in her loud tones    it is only a nice fresh steak off an elephant  that i have cooked for you  which you smell   there  sit down and make a good breakfast    and she placed a huge dish before him of savory steaming meat  which greatly pleased him  and made him forget his idea of an englishman being in the castle   when he had breakfasted he went out for a walk  and then the giantess opened the door  and made jack come out to help her   he helped her all day   she fed him well  and when evening came put him back in the wardrobe   the giant came in to supper   jack watched him through the keyhole  and was amazed to see him pick a wolf s bone  and put half a fowl at a time into his capacious mouth   when the supper was ended he bade his wife bring him his hen that laid the golden eggs    it lays as well as it did when it belonged to that paltry knight   he said   indeed  i think the eggs are heavier than ever    the giantess went away  and soon returned with a little brown hen  which she placed on the table before her husband    and now  my dear   she said   i am going for a walk  if you don t want me any longer     go  said the giant   i shall be glad to have a nap by and by    then he took up the brown hen and said to her    lay   and she instantly laid a golden egg    lay   said the giant again   and she laid another    lay   he repeated the third time   and again a golden egg lay on the table   now  jack was sure this hen was that of which the fairy had spoken   by and by the giant put the hen down on the floor  and soon after went fast asleep  snoring so loud that it sounded like thunder   directly jack perceived that the giant was fast asleep  he pushed open the door of the wardrobe and crept out  very softly he stole across the room  and  picking up the hen  made haste to quit the apartment   he knew the way to the kitchen  the door of which he found was left ajar  he opened it  shut and locked it after him  and flew back to the beanstalk  which he descended as fast as his feet would move   when his mother saw him enter the house she wept for joy  for she had feared that the fairies had carried him away  or that the giant had found him   but jack put the brown hen down before her  and told her how he had been in the giant s castle  and all his adventures   she was very glad to see the hen  which would make them rich once more   jack made another journey up the beanstalk to the giant s castle one day while his mother had gone to market  but first he dyed his hair and disguised himself   the old woman did not know him again  and dragged him in as she had done before  to help her to do the work  but she heard her husband coming  and hid him in the wardrobe  not thinking that it was the same boy who had stolen the hen   she bade him stay quite still there  or the giant would eat him   then the giant came in  saying     fe  fa  fi fo furn   i smell the breath of an englishman   let him he alive or let him be dead   i ll grind his bones to make my bread      nonsense   said the wife   it is only a roasted bullock that i thought would be a titbit for your supper  sit down and i will bring it up at once   the giant sat down  and soon his wife brought up a roasted bullock on a large dish  and they began their supper   jack was amazed to see them pick the bones of the bullock as if it had been a lark   as soon as they had finished their meal  the giantess rose and said    now  my dear  with your leave i am going up to my room to finish the story i am reading   if you want me  call for me     first   answered the giant   bring me my money bags  that i may count my golden pieces before i sleep    the giantess obeyed   she went and soon returned with two large bags over her shoulders  which she put down by her husband    there   she said   that is all that is left of the knight s money  when you have spent it you must go and take another baron s castle     that he shan t  if i can help it   thought jack   the giant  when his wife was gone  took out heaps and heaps of golden pieces  and counted them  and put them in piles  till he was tired of the amusement   then he swept them all back into their bags  and leaning back in his chair fell fast asleep  snoring so loud that no other sound was audible   jack stole softly out of the wardrobe  and taking up the bags of money  which were his very own  because the giant had stolen them from his father   he ran off  and with great difficulty descending the beanstalk  laid the bags of gold on his mother s table   she had just returned from town  and was crying at not finding jack    there  mother  i have brought you the gold that my father lost     oh  jack   you are a very good boy  but i wish you would not risk your precious life in the giant s castle   tell me how you came to go there again    and jack told her all about it   jack s mother was very glad to get the money  but she did not like him to run any risk for her   but after a time jack made up his mind to go again to the giant s castle   so he climbed the beanstalk once more  and blew the horn at the giant s gate   the giantess soon opened the door  she was very stupid  and did not know him again    but she stopped a minute before she took him in  she feared another robbery  but jack s fresh face looked so innocent that she could not resist him  and so she bade him come in  and again hid him away in the wardrobe   by and by the giant came home  and as soon as he had crossed the threshold he roared out      fe  fa  li fo fum   i smell the breath of an englishman   let him be alive or let him be dead   i ll grind his bones to make my bread      you stupid old giant   said his wife   you only smell a nice sheep  which i have grilled for your dinner    and the giant sat down  and his wife brought up a whole sheep for his dinner   when he had eaten it all up  he said    now bring me my harp  and i will have a little music while you take your walk    the giantess obeyed  and returned with a beautiful harp   the framework was all sparkling with diamonds and rubies  and the strings were all of gold    this is one of the nicest things i took from the knight   said the giant    i am very fond of music  and my harp is a faithful servant    so he drew the harp toward him  and said    play    and the harp played a very soft  sad air    play something merrier   said the giant   and the harp played a merry tune    now play me a lullaby   roared the giant  and the harp played a sweet lullaby  to the sound of which its master fell asleep   then jack stole softly out of the wardrobe  and went into the huge kitchen to see if the giantess had gone out  he found no one there  so he went to the door and opened it softly  for he thought he could not do so with the harp in his hand   then he entered the giant s room and seized the harp and ran away with it  but as he jumped over the threshold the harp called out   master  master    and the giant woke up   with a tremendous roar he sprang from his seat  and in two strides had reached the door   but jack was very nimble   he fled like lightning with the harp  talking to it as he went  for he saw it was a fairy   and telling it he was the son of its old master  the knight   still the giant came on so fast that he was quite close to poor jack  and had stretched out his great hand to catch him   but  luckily  just at that moment he stepped upon a loose stone  stumbled  and fell flat on the ground  where he lay at his full length   this accident gave jack time to get on the bean stalk and hasten down it  but just as he reached their own garden he beheld the giant descending after him    mother   mother   cried jack   make haste and give me the ax    his mother ran to him with a hatchet in her hand  and jack with one tremendous blow cut through all the beanstalks except one    now  mother  stand out of the way   said he   jack s mother shrank back  and it was well she did so  for just as the giant took hold of the last branch of the beanstalk  jack cut the stem quite through and darted from the spot   down came the giant with a terrible crash  and as he fell on his head  he broke his neck  and lay dead at the feet of the woman he had so much injured   before jack and his mother had recovered from their alarm and agitation  a beautiful lady stood before them    jack   said she   you have acted like a brave knight s son  and deserve to have your inheritance restored to you   dig a grave and bury the giaint  and then go and kill the giantess     but   said jack   i could not kill any one unless i were fighting with him  and i could not draw my sword upon a woman   moreover  the giantess was very kind to me    the fairy smiled on jack    i am very much pleased with your generous feeling   she said   nevertheless  return to the castle  and act as you will find needful    jack asked the fairy if she would show him the way to the castle  as the beanstalk was now down   she told him that she would drive him there in her chariot  which was drawn by two peacocks   jack thanked her  and sat down in the chariot with her   the fairy drove him a long distance round  till they reached a village which lay at the bottom of the mill   here they found a number of miserable looking men assembled   the fairy stopped her carriage and addressed them    my friends   said she   the cruel giant who oppressed you and ate up all your flocks and herds is dead  and this young gentleman was the means of your being delivered from him  and is the son of your kind old master  the knight    the men gave a loud cheer at these words  and pressed forward to say that they would serve jack as faithfully as they had served his father  the fairy bade them follow her to the castle  and they marched thither in a body  and jack blew the horn and demanded admittance   the old giantess saw them coming from the turret loophole   she was very much frightened  for she guessed that something had happened to her husband  and as she came downstairs very fast she caught her foot in her dress  and fell from the top to the bottom and broke her neck   when the people outside found that the door was not opened to them  they took crowbars and forced the portal   nobody was to be seen  but on leaving the mall they found the body of the giantess at the foot of the stairs   thus jack took possession of the castle   the fairy went and brought his mother to him  with the hen and the harp   he had the giantess buried  and endeavored as much as lay in his power to do right to those whom the giant had robbed   before her departure for fairyland  the fairy explained to jack that she had sent the butcher to meet him with the beans  in order to try what sort of lad he was    if you had looked at the gigantic beanstalk and only stupidly wondered about it   she said   i should have left you where misfortune had placed you  only restoring her cow to your mother   but you showed an inquiring mind  and great courage and enterprise  therefore you deserve to rise  and when you mounted the beanstalk you climbed the ladder of fortune    she then took her leave of jack and his mother    hop o  my thumb  retold by joseph jacobs  once upon a time there was a wood cutter and his wife who had seven children  all boys   the eldest was only ten years old   they were very poor  and their seven children were a great burden  since not one of them was able to earn his living   what troubled them still more was the fact that the youngest was not only very delicate  but silent  which they took for stupidity  but which was really a mark of his good sense   he was very small  and when he was born he was scarcely bigger than one s thumb  which caused him to be called little  hop o  my thumb    this poor child was the scapegoat of the house  and was blamed for everything   he was  however  sharper and wiser than all his brothers  and though he spoke little  he listened a great deal   at last there came a bad year  and so great a famine  that the poor people resolved to rid themselves of their children   one evening  when the children were all in bed  and the wood cutter with a sorrowful heart  was sitting by the fire with his wife  he said to her   you know that we can no longer support our children   i cannot let them die of hunger before my eyes  and i am resolved to take them to the wood to  morrow  and lose them   it will be easy to do this  for  while they amuse themselves tying my sticks  we have only to slip away without their seeing us    ah   cried his wife   would you then destroy your children     in vain did her husband set forth to her their great poverty  she would not consent   she was poor  she said   but she was their mother   at last  having considered what a grief it would be to her to have them die of hunger before her eyes  she agreed to her husband s plan  and went  weeping  to bed   hop o  my thumb had listened to all that they had said  for having heard them  from his bed  talking of family matters  he had risen softly and slipped under his father s stool  in order to hear without being seen   he then went back to bed  but lay awake the rest of the night  thinking what he should do   he rose early and went to a brook  where he filled his pocket with little white pebbles  and then returned to the house   soon after  they all set off  but hop o  my thumb did not tell his brothers anything of what he knew   they went into a forest  so thick that they could not see each other at a distance of ten paces   the wood cutter began to fell a tree  while the children gathered sticks to make up into bundles   the father and mother  seeing them thus employed  slipped away unnoticed  and then fled rapidly  by a little winding path   when the children found they were alone  they began to scream and cry with all their strength   hop o  my thumb let them cry  knowing well how to get home  for  while walking  he had dropped along the path the little white pebbles which he had in his pockets   he therefore said to them   fear not  brothers  my father and mother have left us here  but i will lead you to the house only follow me    they obeyed at once  and he led them home along the same path by which they had come into the forest at first   they did not dare to go into the house  but placed themselves near the door  in order to hear what their father and mother were saying   now it had so happened that  just as the woodcutter and his wife reached home  the lord of the village had sent them ten crowns  which he had long owed them  and which they had never hoped to obtain   this gave them new life  for the poor creatures were almost dead from hunger   the wood cutter immediately sent his wife to the butcher s  where  as it was long since they had eaten anything  she bought three times as much meat as was needed for the supper of two people   when they were seated at table  the wife said   alas   where now are our poor children   they would make good cheer with what we have left  but it is you who wished to lose them   i always said we should repent it   what are they doing now in the forest   alas   alas   perhaps the wolves have already eaten them   you were most cruel thus to lose your children    the wood cutter at last grew impatient  for she repeated more than twenty times that they would repent what they had done  and that she had told him so   he threatened to beat her if she was not silent   the wood cutter did not do this because he was less sorry than his wife  but because her reproaches angered him   his wife now shed tears  and cried out   alas   where are my children  my poor children    she said this so loud that the children  who were at the door  heard her  and all cried out together   here we are   here we are    she ran quickly to open the door  and said  as she embraced them   how overjoyed i am to see you again  my darling children   you must be very tired and very hungry  and you  peter  how muddy you are   come  let me brush you    peter was her eldest son  whom she loved more than all the others   the children then sat down at the table  and ate with an appetite which delighted their father and mother  to whom they described  all speaking at once  how frightened they had been in the forest   these good people were filled with joy to have their children with them again  and this joy lasted as long as the ten crowns held out   but when the money was spent  they fell back into their former misery  and resolved to lose them once more  and in order not to fail again  they determined to take them much further into the forest than the first time   they could not  however  speak of this so secretly but that they were overheard by hop o  my thumb  who laid his plans to escape as before  although he got up early in order to go out and pick up some little stones  he could not succeed in his purpose  for he found the door of the house shut and double bolted   he was wondering what he should do  when  his mother having given them each a bit of bread for breakfast  he thought that he might use his bread instead of pebbles by dropping crumbs along the paths as they walked   he therefore slipped the bread into his pocket   their father and mother led them this time into the thickest and darkest part of the forest  and  as soon as they were there  ran away and left them   hop o  my thumb was not much troubled  because he believed he could easily find his way by means of the bread which he had scattered as he passed along   what was his surprise when he could not find a single crumb  the birds had come and eaten it all   now was their lot indeed wretched  the more they wandered about  the deeper they buried themselves in the forest   night came  and a great wind arose which frightened them terribly   they thought they heard on all sides the howling of hungry wolves coming to eat them up   they did not dare to speak  or even turn their heads   rain began to fall  which wet them to the skin   they slipped at every step  and  if they fell  got up so covered with mud that they could hardly move their hands   finally  hop o  my thumb climbed to the top of a tree  to see if he could not discover something   having looked on all sides  he at last saw a little gleam of light  like that from a candle  but it was very far off  beyond the forest   he got down from the tree  but when he was on the ground he no longer saw anything  which troubled him greatly  however  having walked for some time with his brothers in the direction where he had seen the light  he again saw it as they came out of the wood   at last they reached the house where the candle was  though not without many alarms  for they lost sight of it whenever they descended unto a hollow place   they knocked at the door  which was opened to them by a woman   she asked them what they wanted   hop o  my thumb replied that they were poor children who had lost themselves in the forest  and who asked  for charity s sake  a place to sleep   the woman  seeing how bitter they were  began to weep  and said to them   alas   my poor children  whence do you come   do you not know that this is the house of an ogre  who eats little children     alas  madam   said hop o  my thumb  who like his brothers was shaking with fear   what shall we do   the wolves of the forest will certainly devour us to night  if you will not give us shelter   this being the case  we had rather be eaten by the ogre  and he  perhaps  will take pity on us  if you will beg him to do so    the ogre s wife  who thought she might be able to conceal them from her husband till the next morning  let them come in  and placed them near a good fire  where a whole sheep was roasting for the ogre s supper   when they had begun to get warm  they heard three or four heavy knocks at the door   it was the ogre   his wife hastily hid the children under the bed  and then opened the door   the ogre asked first if supper was ready  and the wine drawn  and then sat down at the table   the mutton was nearly raw  but he liked it all the better on that account   he then began to sniff about  saying that he smelled fresh meat    it must be this calf which i have just been dressing that you smell   said the wife    i smell fresh meat  i tell you again   said the ogre  looking fiercely at his wife   and there is something more of which i do not know    saying these words  he rose from the table and went straight to the bed  where he found the poor children    ah   said he   this  then  is the way you wish to deceive me  wicked woman   i know not what prevents me from eating you  too   here is game  which comes to me very conveniently to treat three ogres of my acquaintance  who are coming to visit me about this time    he then drew the little boys from under the bed  one after another  the poor children threw themselves on their knees begging for pardon  but they had to do with the most cruel of all the ogres  who  far from having pity  devoured them already with his eyes  and said to his wife that they would be delicious morsels fried  when she had made a good sauce for them   he took out a great knife  and  approaching the poor children  began to sharpen it on a long stone  which he held in his left hand   he then seized one of them  when his wife said to him   why do you begin at this time of night   shall you not have time to morrow     be silent   replied the ogre   they will be more tender if i kill them now     but you have already so much meat on hand   replied his wife    here are a calf  two sheep  and half a pig     you are right   said the ogre   give them a good supper  that they may not grow thin  and put them to bed    the good woman was overcome with joy  and brought them their supper at once  but they were too frightened to eat   as for the ogre  he set himself to drinking  delighted to have something with which to regale his friends   he drank a dozen cups more than usual  which went to his head  and obliged him to go early to bed   now this ogre had seven daughters  who were still only children   these little ogresses all had beautiful complexions  for they ate fresh meat like their father   they had little round gray eyes  crooked noses  and great mouths filled with long teeth  very sharp and far apart   they were not yet very wicked  but they promised well  for they already bit little children whenever they got the chance   they had been put to bed early  and were all seven in one bed  each having a golden crown on her head   there was in the same room anther bed of the same size   here it was that the ogre s wife put the seven little boy s  after which she went to bed in her own chamber   hop o  my thumb  who had remarked that the ogre s daughters had golden crowns on their heads  was afraid that the ogre might regret not having killed him and his brothers that evening   so he rose about the middle of the night  and  taking his nightcap and those of his brothers  he went very softly and placed them on the heads of the ogre s seven daughters  after having removed their golden crowns   he then put the crowns on his brothers  heads and on his own  so that the ogre might mistake them for his daughters  and his daughters for the boys whom he wished to kill   the plan succeeded as he had expected   the ogre  having awakened about midnight  was sorry that he had put off till next day what he might have done that evening   he jumped quickly out of bed  and  taking his great knife   let us see   said he   how our little friends are getting on    he went on tiptoe to the room of his daughters  and approached the bed where the little boys were all asleep  except hop o  my thumb  who was terribly frightened when he felt the ogre s hand touching his head  as he had already touched his brothers    but when the ogre felt the golden crowns  he said   indeed  i was near making a nice piece of work of it   i see that i drank too much in the evening    he then went to the bed of his daughters  where he felt the boys  little nightcaps    ah   here they are   said he   the fine fellows   i must go boldly to work   saying these words  and without hesitating  he cut the throats of his seven daughters   very well pleased with his expedition  he went back to bed   as soon as hop o  my thumb heard the ogre snoring  he awakened his brothers  and told them to dress themselves quickly and follow him   they went softly down unto the garden  and leaped over the walls   they hurried away  and ran almost all night  without knowing whither they went   the ogre  when he woke up  said to his wife   go upstairs and dress those little fellows who were here last night     the ogress was very much astonished at the kindness of her husband  not suspecting for a moment the way in which he meant that she should dress them   believing that he simply wished her to put on their clothes  she went upstairs  where she was amazed to see her seven daughters with their throats cut   she was so overcome that she immediately fainted  the ogre  thinking his wife was too slow  went upstairs to assist her  he was no less astonished than his wife when the frightful sight met his eyes    ah   what have i done here   he cried   but those little wretches shall pay for this  and at once    he then threw a bucket of water into his wife s face  and  having revived her  said   give me quickly my seven league boots  that i may go after those boys and catch them    he then started out into the country at once  and  having rushed about in all directions  came at last to the road where the poor children were walking  and then not more than a hundred steps from their father s house   they saw the ogre striding from mountain to mountain  and crossing rivers as if they were little brooks   hop o  my thumb  who saw a hollow rock near the place where they were  hid himself and his six brothers there  and watched carefully what became of their enemy   the ogre  who was very tired with his long and fruitless journey  wished to rest himself  and sat down  by chance  on the very rock where the little boys were hidden   as he was overcome with fatigue  he soon fell asleep  and began to snore so frightfully that the poor children were as much frightened as when he held his knife ready to cut their throats   hop o  my thumb was less afraid  and told his brothers to run into the house while the ogre slept  and not to worry about him   they followed his counsel  and quickly reached the house   hop o  my thumb then approached the ogre  softly drew off his boots  and put them on himself   the boots were very long and very large  but  as they were fairy boots  they had the gift of becoming larger or smaller  according to the size of the wearer s leg   in fact  they fitted hop o  my thumb as if they had been made for him   he then went straight to the ogre s house  where he found his wife weeping over her daughters    your husband   said hop o  my thumb   is in great danger  for he has been taken by a band of robbers  who will kill him if he does not give them all his gold and silver   just when they held their knives to his throat he perceived me  and besought me to come and tell you of the state in which he was  and to direct you to give me all that he has  without retaining anything  since otherwise they would slay him without mercy   as time passed  he wished that i should take his seven league boots  as you see  in order to make haste  and also that you might not think me an impostor    the good woman  very much frightened  gave him all she had  for this ogre was a good husband  although he did eat little children   hop o  my thumb  being then loaded with all the ogre s treasures  returned to his father s house  where he was welcomed with great joy and where they all lived happily ever after    the goose girl  anonymous  there was once upon a time an old queen whose husband had been dead for many years  and she had a beautiful daughter   when the princess grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived at a great distance   when the time came for her to be married  and she had to  journey forth into the distant kingdom  the aged queen packed up for her many costly vessels of silver and gold  and trinkets also of gold and silver  and cups and jewels  in short  everything which appertained to a royal dowry  for she loved her child with all her heart   she likewise sent her maid in waiting  who was to ride with her  and hand her over to the bridegroom  and each had a horse for the journey  but the horse of the king s daughter was called falada  and could speak   so when the hour of parting had come  the aged mother went into her bedroom  took a small knife and cut her finger with it until it bled  then she held a white handkerchief to it into which she left three drops of blood fall  gave it to her daughter and said   dear child  preserve this carefully  it will be of service to you on your way    so they took a sorrowful leave of each other  the princess put the piece of cloth in her bosom  mounted her horse  and then went away to her bridegroom   after she had ridden for a while she felt a burning thirst and said to her waiting maid   dismount  and take my cup which thou hast brought with thee for me  and get me some water from the stream  for i should like to drink     if you are thirsty   said the waiting maid   get off your horse yourself  and lie down and drink out of the water  i don t choose to be your servant    so in her great thirst the princess alighted  bent down over the water in the stream and drank  and was not allowed to drink out of the golden cup   then she said   ah  heaven   and the three drops of blood answered    if thy mother knew this  her heart would break    but the king s daughter was humble  said nothing  and mounted her horse again   she rode some miles further  but the day was warm  the sun scorched her  and she was thirsty once more  and when they came to a stream of water  she again cried to her waiting maid   dismount  and give me some water in my golden cup   for she had long ago forgotten the girl s ill words   but the waiting maid said still more haughtily   if you wish to drink  drink as you can  i don t choose to be your maid    then in her great thirst the king s daughter alighted  bent over the flowing stream  wept and said   ah  heaven   and the drops of blood again replied   if thy mother knew this  her heart would break   and as she was thus drinking and leaning right over the stream  the handkerchief with the three drops of blood fell out of her bosom  and floated away with the water without her observing it  so great was her trouble   the waiting maid  however  had seen it  and she rejoiced to think that she had now power over the bride  for since the princess had lost the drops of blood  she had become weak and powerless   so now when she wanted to mount her horse again  the one that was called falada  the waiting maid said   falada is more suitable for me  and my nag will do for thee   and the princess had to be content with that   then the waiting maid  with many hard words  bade the princess exchange her royal apparel for her own shabby clothes  and at length she was compelled to swear by the clear sky above her  that she would not say one word of this to any one at the royal court  and if she had not taken this oath she would have been killed on the spot   but falada saw all this  and observed it well   the waiting maid now mounted falada  and the true bride the bad horse  and thus they traveled onward  until at length they entered the royal palace   there were great rejoicings over her arrival  and the prince sprang forward to meet her  lifted the waiting maid from her horse  and thought she was his consort   she was conducted upstairs  but the real princess was left standing below   then the old king looked out of the window and saw her standing in the courtyard  and how dainty and delicate and beautiful she was  and instantly went to the royal apartment  and asked the bride about the girl she had with her who was standing down below in the courtyard  and who she was    i picked her up on my way for a companion  give the girl something to work at  that she may not stand idle    but the old king had no work for her  and knew of none  so he said   i have a little boy who tends the geese  she may help him    the boy was called conrad  and the true bride had to help him to tend the geese   soon afterward the false bride said to the young king   dearest husband  i beg you to do me a favor    he answered   i will do so most willingly     then send for the knacker  and have the head of the horse on which i rode here cut off  for it vexed me on the way    in reality she was afraid that the horse might tell how she had behaved to the king s daughter   then she succeeded in making the king promise that it should be done  and the faithful falada was to die  this came to the ears of the real princess  and she secretly promised to pay the knacker a piece of gold if he would perform a small service for her   there was a great dark looking gateway in the town  through which morning and evening she had to pass with the geese  would he be so good as to nail up falada s head on it  so that she might see him again  more than once   the knacker s man promised to do that  and cut off the head  and nailed it fast beneath the dark gateway   early in the morning  when she and conrad drove out their flock beneath this gateway  she said in passing     alas  falada  hanging there   then the head answered     alas  young queen  how ill you fare   if this your tender mother knew   her heart would surely break in two     then they went still further out of the town  and drove their geese into the country   and when they had come to the meadow  she sat down and unbound her hair which was like pure gold  and conrad saw it and delighted in its brightness  and wanted to pluck out a few hairs   then she said     blow  blow  thou gentle wind  i say   blow conrad s little hat away   and make him chase it here and there   until i have braided all my hair   and bound it up again    and there came such a violent wind that it blew conrad s hat far away across country  and he was forced to run after it   when he came back she had finished combing her hair and was putting it up again  and he could not get any of it   then conrad was angry  and would not speak to her  and thus they watered the geese until the evening  and then they went home   next day when they were driving the geese out through the dark gateway  the maiden said     alas  falada  hanging there   falada answered     alas  young queen  how ill you fare   if this your tender mother knew   her heart would surely break in two     and she sat down again in the field and began to comb out her hair  and conrad ran and tried to clutch it  so she said in haste     blow  blow  thou gentle wind  i say   blow conrad s little hat away   and make him chase it here and there   until i have braided all my hair   and bound it up again    then the wind blew  and blew his little hat off his head and far away  and conrad was forced to run after it  and when he came back  her hair had been put up a long time  and he could get none of it  and so they looked after their geese till evening came   but in the evening after they had got home  conrad went to the old king  and said   i won t tend the geese with that girl any longer    why not   inquired the aged king    oh  because she vexes me the whole day long    then the aged king commanded him to relate what it was that she did to him   and conrad said   in the morning when we pass beneath the dark gateway with the flock  there is a sorry horse s head on the wall and she says to it     alas  falada  hanging there     and the head replies     alas  young queen  how ill you fare   if this your tender mother knew   her heart would surely break in two     and conrad went on to relate what happened on the goose pasture  and how when there he had to chase his hat   the aged king commanded him to drive his flock out again next day  and as soon as morning came  he placed himself behind the dark gateway  and heard how the maiden spoke to the head of falada  and then he too went into the country  and hid himself in the thicket in the meadow   there he soon saw with his own eyes the goose girl and the goose boy bringing their flock  and how after a while she sat down and unplaited her hair  which shone with radiance   and soon she said     blow  blow  thou gentle wind  i say   blow conrad s little hat away   and make him chase it here and there   until i have braided all my hair   and bound it up again     then came a blast of wind and carried off conrad s hat  so that he had to run far away  while the maiden quietly went on combing and plaiting her hair  all of which the king observed   then  quite unseen  he went away  and when the goose girl came home in the evening  he called her aside  and asked why she did all these things    i may not tell you that  and i dare not lament my sorrows to any human being  for i have sworn not to do so by the heaven which is above me  if i had not done that  i should have lost my life    he urged her and left her no peace  but he could draw nothing from her   then said he   if thou wilt not tell me anything  tell thy sorrows to the iron stove there   and he went away   then she crept into the iron stove  and began to weep and lament  and emptied her whole heart  and said   here am i deserted by the whole world  and yet i am a king s daughter  and a false waiting  maid has by force brought me to such a pass that i have been compelled to put off my royal apparel  and she has taken my place with my bridegroom  and i have to perform menial service as a goose girl   if my mother did but know that  her heart would break    the aged king  however  was standing outside by the pipe of the stove  and was listening to what she said and heard it   then he came back again  and bade her come out of the stove   and royal garments were placed on her  and it was marvellous how beautiful she was   the aged king summoned his son  and revealed to him that he had got the false bride who was only a waiting maid  but that the true one was standing there  as the sometime goose girl   the young king rejoiced with all his heart when he saw her beauty and youth  and a great feast was made ready to which all the people and all good friends were invited   at the head of the table sat the bridegroom with the king s daughter at one side of him and the waiting maid on the other  but the waiting maid was blinded  and did not recognize the princess in her dazzling array  when they had eaten and drunk  and were merry  the aged king asked the waiting maid as a riddle  what a person deserved who had behaved in such and such a way to her master  and at the same time related the whole story  and asked what sentence such an one merited   then the false bride said   she deserves no better fate than to be stripped entirely naked  and put in a barrel which is studded inside with pointed nails  and two white horses should be harnessed to it  which will drag her along through one street after another  till she is dead     it is thou   said the aged king   and thou must pronounce thine own sentence  and thus shall it be done unto thee    and when the sentence had been carried out  the young king married his true bride  and both of them reigned over their kingdom in peace and happiness    he who knew not fear  anonymous  a certain father had two sons  the elder of whom was sharp and sensible  and could do everything  but the younger was stupid and could neither learn nor understand anything  and when people saw him they said   there s a fellow who will give his father some trouble    when anything had to be done  it was always the elder who was forced to do it  but if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late  or in the night time  and the way led through the churchyard  or any other dismal place  he answered   oh  no  father  i ll not go there  it makes me shudder   for he was afraid   or when stories were told by the fire at night which made the flesh creep  the listeners often said   oh  it makes us shudder   the younger sat in a corner and listened with the rest of them  and could not imagine what they could mean    they are always saying   it makes me shudder  it makes me shudder   it does not make me shudder   thought he    that  too  must be an art of which i understand nothing    now it came to pass that his father said to him one day   hearken to me  thou fellow in the corner there  thou art growing tall and strong  and thou  too  must learn something by which thou canst earn thy living   look how thy brother works  but thou dost not even earn thy salt     well  father   he replied   i am quite willing to learn something indeed  if it could but be managed  i should like to learn how to shudder   i don t understand that at all yet    the elder brother smiled when he heard that  and thought to himself    good god  what a blockhead that brother of mine is   he will never be good for anything as long as he lives   he who wants to be a sickle must bend himself betimes    the father sighed  and answered him   thou shalt soon learn what it is to suffer  but thou wilt not earn thy living by that    soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit  and the father bewailed his trouble  and told him how his younger son was so backward in every respect that he knew nothing and learned nothing    just think   said he   when i asked him how he was going to earn his bread  he actually wanted to learn to shudder     if that be all   replied the sexton   he can learn that with me   send him to me  and i will soon polish him    the father was glad to do it  for he thought   it will train the boy a little    the sexton  therefore  took him into his house  and he had to ring the bell   after a day or two the sexton awoke him at midnight  and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and ring the bell    thou shalt soon learn what shuddering is   thought he  and secretly went there before him  and when the boy was at the top of the tower and turned around  and was just going to take hold of the bell rope  he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite to the sounding hole    who is there   cried he  but the figure made no reply  and did not move or stir    give an answer   cried the boy   or take thyself off  thou hast no business here at night    the sexton  however  remained standing motionless  that the boy might think he was a ghost   the boy cried a second time   what dost thou want here  speak if thou art an honest fellow  or i will throw thee down the steps    the sexton thought   he can t intend to be as bad as his words   uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone  then the boy called to him for the third time  and as that was also to no purpose  he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs  so that it fell down ten steps and remained lying there in a corner  thereupon he rang the bell  went home  and without saying a word went to bed and fell asleep   the sexton s wife waited a long time for her husband  but he did not come back   at length she became uneasy  and wakened the boy  and asked   dost thou not know where my husband is  he went up the tower before thou didst     no  i don t know   replied the boy   but someone was standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps  and as he would neither give an answer nor go away  i took him for a scoundrel  and threw him down stairs  just go there and you will see if it was he  i should be sorry if it were    the woman ran away and found her husband  who was lying moaning in the corner  and had broken his leg   she carried him down  and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy s father    your boy   cried she   has been the cause of a great misfortune   he has thrown my husband down the steps and made him break his leg   take the good for nothing fellow away from our house    the father was terrified  and ran thither and scolded the boy    what wicked tricks are these   said he   the devil must have put this into thy head     father   he replied   do listen to me   i am quite innocent   he was standing there by night like one who is intending to do some evil   i did not know who it was  and i entreated him three times either to speak or to go away     ah   said the father   i have nothing but unhappiness with thee   go out of my sight   i will see thee no more     yes  father  right willingly  wait only until it is day   then will i go forth and learn how to shudder  and then i shall  at any rate  understand one art which will support me     learn what thou wilt   spake the father   it is all the same to me   here are fifty thalers for thee   take these and go into the wide world  and tell no one from whence thou comest  and who is thy father  for i have reason to be ashamed of thee     yes  father  it small be as you will   if you desire nothing more than that  i can easily keep it in mind    when day dawned  therefore  the boy put his fifty thalers into his pocket  and went forth on the great highway  and continually said to himself   if i could but shudder   if i could but shudder    then a man approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with himself  and when they had walked a little further to where they could see the gallows  the man said to him   look  there is the tree where seven men have married the ropemaker s daughter  and are now learning how to fly   sit down below it  and wait till night comes  and thou wilt soon learn how to shudder     if that is all that is wanted   answered the youth   it is easily done  but if i learn how to shudder as quickly as that  thou shalt have my fifty thalers   just come back to me early in the morning    then the youth went to the gallows  sat down below it  and waited till evening came   and as he was cold  he lighted himself a fire  but at midnight the wind blew so sharp that in spite of his fire he could not get warm   and as the wind knocked the hanged men against each other  and they moved backward and forward  he thought to himself   thou shiverest below by the fire  but how those up above must freeze and suffer    and as he felt pity for them  he raised the ladder  and climbed up  unbound one of them after the other  and brought down all seven   then he stirred the fire  blew it  and set them all round it to warm themselves   but they sat there and did not stir  and the fire caught their clothes   so he said    take care  or i will hang you up again    the dead men  however  did not hear  but were quite silent  and let their rags go on burning   on this he grew angry  and said   if you will not take care  i cannot help you  i will not be burned with you  and he hung them up again each in his turn   then he sat down by his fire and fell asleep  and next morning the man came to him and wanted to have the fifty thalers  and said   well  dost thou know how to shudder     no   answered he   how was i to get to know   those fellows up there did not open their mouths  and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which they had on their bodies get burned    then the man saw that he would not carry away the fifty thalers that day  and went away saying    one of this kind has never come in my way before    the youth likewise went his way  and once more began to mutter to himself   ah  if i could but shudder   ah  if i could but shudder    a wagoner who was striding behind him heard that and asked   who art thou     i don t know   answered the youth   then the wagoner asked    from whence comest thou     i know not     who is thy father     that i may not tell thee     what is it that thou art always muttering between thy teeth     ah   replied the youth   i do so wish i could shudder  but no one can teach me how to do it     give up thy foolish chatter   said the wagoner    come go with me  i will see about a place for thee    the youth went with the wagoner  and in the evening they arrived at an inn where they wished to pass the night   then at the entrance of the room the youth again said quite loudly   if i could but shudder   if i could but shudder    the host who heard that  laughed and said   if that is your desire  there ought to be a good opportunity for you here     ah  be silent   said the hostess   so many inquisitive persons have already lost their lives  it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight again    but the youth said   however difficult it may be  i will learn it  and for this purpose indeed have i journeyed forth    he let the host have no rest  until the latter told him  that not far from thence stood a haunted castle where any one could very easily learn what shuddering was  if he would but watch in it for three nights   the king had promised that he who would venture this should have his daughter to wife  and she was the most beautiful maiden the sun shone on   great treasures likewise lay in the castle  which were guarded by evil spirits  and these treasures would then be freed  and would make a poor man rich enough   already many men had gone into the castle  but as yet none had come out again   then the youth went next morning to the king  and said that if he were allowed he would watch three nights in the enchanted castle   the king looked at him  and as the youth pleased him  he said   thou mayst ask for three things to take into the castle with thee  but they must be things without life    then he answered   then i ask for a fire  a turning lathe  and a cutting board with the knife    the king had these things carried into the castle for him during the day   when night was drawing near  the youth went up and made himself a bright fire in one of the rooms  placed the cutting  board and knife beside it  and seated himself by the turning lathe   ah  if i could but shudder   said he   but i shall not learn it here either    toward midnight he was about to poke his fire  and as he was blowing it  something cried suddenly from one cornier   au  miau   how cold we are     you simpletons   cried he   what are you crying about  if you are cold  come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves   and when he had said that  two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down on each side of him  and looked savagely at him with their fiery eyes   after a short time  when they had warmed themselves  they said   comrade  shall we have a game at cards     why not   he replied   but just show me your paws   then they stretched out their claws    oh   said he   what long nails you have   wait  i must first cut them a little for you    thereupon he seized them by the throats  put them on the cutting board and screwed their feet fast    i have looked at your fingers   said he   and my fancy for card playing has gone  and he struck them dead and threw them out into the water  but when he had made away with these two  and was about to sit down again by his fire  out from every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with red hot chains  and more and more of them came until he could no longer stir  and they yelled horribly  and got on his fire  pulled it to pieces  and wanted to put it out   he watched them for a while quietly  but at last when they were going too far  he seized his cutting knife  and cried   away with ye  vermin   and began to cut them down   part of them ran away  the others he killed  and threw out into the fish pond   when he came back he blew up the embers of his fire again and warmed himself   and as he thus sat  his eyes would keep open no longer  and he felt a desire to sleep   then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner    that is the very thing for me   said he  and got into it   when he was just going to shut his eyes  however  the bed began to move of its own accord  and went over the whole of the castle    that s right   said he   but go faster    then the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it  up and down  over thresholds and steps  but suddenly  hop  hop  it turned over upside down  and lay on him like a mountain   but he threw quilts and pillows up in the air  got out and said   now any one who likes may drive   and lay down by his fire  and slept until it was day   in the morning the king came  and when he saw him lying there on the ground  he thought the spirits had killed him and he was dead   then said he   after all it is a pity  he is a handsome man    the youth heard it  got up  and said   it has not come to that yet    then the king was astonished  but very glad  and asked how he had fared    very well indeed   answered he   one night is over  the two others will get over likewise    then he went to the innkeeper  who opened his eyes very wide  and said   i never expected to see thee alive again   hast thou learned how to shudder yet     no   said he   it is all in vain   if some one would but tell me    the second night he again went up into the old castle  sat down by the fire  and once more began his old song   if i could but shudder    when midnight came  an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard  at first it was low  but it grew louder and louder   then it was quiet for a while  and at length with a loud scream  half a man came down the chimney and fell before him    hollo   cried he   another half belongs to this   this is too little    then the uproar began again  there was a roaring and howling  and the other half fell down likewise    wait   said he   i will just blow up the fire a little for thee    when he had done that and looked round again  the two pieces were joined together  and a frightful man was sitting in his place    that is no part of our bargain   said the youth   the bench is mine    the man wanted to push him away  the youth  however  would not allow that  but thrust him off with all his strength  and seated himself again  in his own place  then still more men fell down  one after the other  they brought nine dead men s legs and two skulls  and set them up and played at ninepins with them   the youth also wanted to play and said   hark you  can i join you     yes  if thou hast any money     money enough   replied he   but your balls are not quite round    then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and turned them till they were round    there  now  they will roll better   said he    hurrah   now it goes merrily    he played with them and lost some of his money  but when it struck twelve  everything vanished from his sight   he lay down and quietly fell asleep   next morning the king came to inquire after him    how has it fared with thee this time   asked he    i have been playing at ninepins   he answered   and have lost a couple of farthings     hast thou not shuddered then     eh  what   said he   i have made merry   if i did but know what it was to shudder    the third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly   if i could but shudder    when it grew late  six tall men came in and brought a coffin   then said he   ha  ha  that is certainly my little cousin  who only died a few days ago   and he beckoned with his finger  and cried   come  little cousin  come    they placed the coffin on the ground  but he went to it and took the lid off  and a dead man lay therein   he felt his face  but it was cold as ice    stop   said he   i will warm thee a  little   and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the dead man s face  but he remained cold   then he took him out  and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his arms that the blood might circulate again   as this also did no good  he thought to himself   when two people lie in bed together  they warm each other   and carried him to bed  covered him over and lay down by him   after a short time the dead man became warm too  and began to move   then said the youth   see  little cousin  have i not warmed thee   the dead man  however  got up and cried   now will i strangle thee     what   said he   is that the way thou thankest me   thou shalt at once go into thy coffin again   and he took him up  threw him into it  and shut the lid   then came the six men and carried him away again    i cannot manage to shudder   said he    i shall never learn it here as long as i live    then a man entered who was taller than all others  and looked terrible  he was old  however  and had a long white beard    thou wretch   cried he   thou shalt soon learn what it is to shudder  for thou shalt die    not so fast   replied the youth   if i am to die  i shall have to have a say in it     i will soon seize thee   said the fiend    softly  softly  do not talk so big   i am as strong as thou art  and perhaps even stronger     we shall see   said the old man    if thou art stronger  i will let thee go come  we will try    then he led him by dark passages to a smith s forge  took an ax  and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground    i can do that better still   said the youth  and went to the other anvil   the old man placed himself near and wanted to look on  and his white heard hung down   then the youth seized the ax  split the anvil with one blow  and struck the old man s beard in with it    now i have thee   said the youth    now it is thou who wilt have to die    then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop  and he would give him great riches   the youth drew out the ax and let him go   the old man led him back into the castle  and in a cellar showed him three chests full of gold    of these   said he   one part is for the poor  the other is for the king  the third is thine    in the meantime it struck twelve  and the spirit disappeared  the youth  therefore  was left in darkness    i shall still be able to find my way out   said he  and felt about  found the way into the room  and slept there by his fire   next morning the king came and said   now thou must have learned what shuddering is    no   he answered   what can it be   my dead cousin was here  and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down below  but no one told me what it was to shudder     then   said the king   thou hast delivered the castle  and shalt marry my daughter     that is all very well   said he   but still i do not know what it is to shudder    then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated  but howsoever much the young king loved his wife  and however happy he was  he still said always   if i could but shudder if i could but shudder    and at last she was angry at this   her waiting maid said   i will find a cure for him  he shall soon learn what it is to shudder    she went out to the stream which flowed through the garden  and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons brought to her   at night when the young king was sleeping  his wife was to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucketful of cold water with the gudgeons in it over him  so that the little fishes would sprawl about him   when this was done  he woke up and cried   oh  what makes me shudder so  what makes me shudder so  dear wife   ah  now i know what it is to shudder     aesop s fables  this has come to be the commonly accepted name for the well known collection of stories about animals  though we cannot be sure that any of them  were written by the greek slave of that name  who  herodotus tells us  lived about the year 55o b c   the fable about animals is probably the oldest form of story known   its object is to teach a lesson to men and women  without seeming to do so  and because of this concealed lesson it has always been a great favorite with all nations  in russia  for example  where a man did not dare say what he thought about a government officer  he could tell a fable about the dog in the manger    the town mouse and the country mouse  now you must know that a town mouse once upon a time went on a visit to his cousin in the country   he was rough and ready  this cousin  but he loved his town friend and made him heartily welcome   beans and bacon  cheese and bread  were all he had to offer  but he offered them freely  the town mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country fare  and said   i cannot understand  cousin  how you can put up with such poor food as this  but of course you cannot expect anything better in the country  come you with me and i will show you how to live   when you have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood a country life    no sooner said than done  the two mice set off for the town and arrived at the town mouse s residence late at night    you will want some refreshment after our long journey   said the polite town mouse  and took his friend into the grand dining room   there they found the remains of a fine feast  and soon the two mice were eating up jellies and cakes and all that was nice   suddenly they heard growling and barking    what is that   said the country mouse    it is only the dogs of the house   answered the other    only   said the country mouse    i do not like that music at my dinner    just at that moment the door flew open  in came two huge mastiffs  and the two mice had to scamper down and run off    good by  cousin   said the country mouse   what   going so soon   said  the other    yes   he replied    better beans and bacon in peace  than cakes and ale in fear     the man  the boy  and donkey  a man and his son were once going with their donkey to market   as they were walking along by its side a countryman passed them and said   you fools  what is a donkey for but to ride upon    so the man put the boy on the donkey and they went on their way   but soon they passed a group of men  one of whom said   see that lazy youngster  he lets his father walk while he rides    so the man ordered his boy to get off  and got on himself   but they hadn t gone far when they passed two women  one of whom said to the other   shame on that lazy lout to let his poor little son trudge along    well  the man didn t know what to do  but at last he took his boy up before him on the donkey   by this time they had come to the town  and the passers by began to jeer and point to them   the man stopped and asked what they were scoffing at   the men said   aren t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey of yours you and your hulking son    the man and boy got off and tried to think what to do   they thought and they thought  till at last they cut down a pole  tied the donkey s feet to it  and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders  they went along amid the laughter of all who met them till they came to market bridge  when the donkey  getting one of his feet loose  kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole   in the struggle the donkey fell over the bridge  and his fore feet being tied together he was drowned    that will teach you   said an old man who had followed them    please all  and you will please  none     the shepherd s boy  there was once a young shepherd boy who tended his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a dark forest   it was rather lonely for him all day  so he thought upon a plan by which he could get a little company and some excitement   he rushed down toward the village calling out  wolf   wolf   and the villagers came out to meet him  and some of them stopped with him for a considerable time   this pleased the boy so much that a few days afterward he tried the same trick  and again the villagers came to his help   but shortly after this a wolf actually did come out from the forest  and began to worry the sheep  and the boy of course cried out  wolf  wolf   still louder than before   but this time the villagers who had been fooled twice before  thought the boy was again deceiving them  and nobody stirred to come to bis help   so the wolf made a good meal off the boy s flock  and when the boy complained  the wise man of the village said    a liar will not be believed  even  when he speaks the truth     androcles  a slave named androcles once escaped from his master and fled to the forest   as he was wandering about there he came upon a lion lying down moaning and groaning   at first he turned to flee  but finding that the lion did not pursue him  he turned back and went up to him   as he came near  the lion put out his paw  which was all swollen and bleeding  and androcles found that a huge thorn had got into it  and was causing all the pain   he pulled out the thorn and bound up the paw of the lion  who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of androcles like a dog   then the lion took androcles to his cave  and every day used to bring him meat from which to live   but shortly afterward both androcles and the lion were captured  and the slave was sentenced to be thrown to the lion  after the latter had been kept without food for several days   the emperor and all his court came to see the spectacle and androcles was led out into the middle of the arena   soon the lion was let loose from his den  and rushed bounding and roaring toward his victim   but as soon as he came near to androcles he recognized his friend  and fawned upon him  and licked his hands like a friendly dog   the emperor  surprised at this  summoned androcles to him  who told him the whole story   whereupon the slave was pardoned and freed  and the lion let loose to his native forest    gratitude is the sign of noble souls     the fox and the stork  at one time the fox and the stork were on visiting terms and seemed very good friends   so the fox invited the stork to dinner  and for a joke put nothing before her but some soup in a very shallow dish   this the fox could easily lap up  but the stork could only wet the end of her long bill in it  and left the meal as hungry as when she began    i am sorry   said the fox   the soup is not to your liking     pray do not apologize   said the stork    i hope you will return this visit  and come and dine with me soon    so a day was appointed when the fox should visit the stork  but when they were seated at table all that was for their dinner was contained in a very long necked jar with a narrow mouth  in which the fox could not insert his snout  so all he could manage to do was to lick the outside of the jar    i will not apologize for the dinner   said the stork    one bad turn deserves another     the crow and the pitcher  a crow  half dead with thirst  came upon a pitcher which had once been full of water  but when the crow put its beak into the mouth of the pitcher he found that only very little water was left in it  and that he could not reach far enough down to get at it   he tried  and he tried  but at last had to give up in despair   then a thought came to him  and he took a pebble and dropped it into the pitcher   then he took another pebble and dropped it into the pitcher   then he took another pebble and dropped that into the pitcher   then he took another pebble and dropped that into the pitcher   then he took another pebble and dropped that into the pitcher   then he took another pebble and dropped that into the pitcher   at last  at last  he saw the water mount up near him  and after casting in a few more pebbles he was able to quench his thirst and save his life    little by little does the trick     the frogs desiring a king  the frogs were living as happy as could be in a marshy swamp that just suited them  they went splashing about caring for nobody and nobody troubling with them   but some of them thought that this was not right  that they should have a king and a proper constitution  so they determined to send up a petition to jove to give them what they wanted   mighty jove   they cried   send unto us a king that will rule over us and keep us in order    jove laughed at their croaking  and threw down into the swamp a huge log  which came down kerplash into the swamp  the frogs were frightened out of their lives by the commotion made in their midst  and all rushed to the bank to look at the horrible monster  but after a time  seeing that it did not move  one or two of the boldest of them ventured out toward the log  and even dared to touch it  still it did not move   then the greatest hero of the frogs jumped upon the log and commenced dancing up and down upon it  thereupon all the frogs came and did the same  and for sometime the frogs went about their business every day without taking the slightest notice of the new king log lying in their midst   but this did not suit them  so they sent another petition to jove  and said to him   we want a real king  one that will really rule over us   now this made jove angry  so he sent among them a big stork that soon set to work gobbling them all up   then the frogs repented when too late    better no rule than cruel rule     the frog and the ox   oh  father   said a little frog to the big one sitting by the side of a pool   i have seen such a terrible monster   it was as big as a mountain  with horns on its head  and a long tail  and it had hoofs divided in two     tush  child  tush   said the old frog   that was only farmer white s ox   it isn t so big either  he may be a little bit taller than i  but i could easily make myself quite as broad  just you see   so he blew himself out  and blew himself out  and blew himself out    was he as big as that   asked he    oh  much bigger than that   said the young frog   again the old one blew himself out  and asked the young one if the ox was as big as that    bigger  father  bigger   was the reply   so the frog took a deep breath  and blew and blew and blew  and swelled and swelled and swelled   and then he said   i m sure the ox is not as big as          but at this moment he burst    self conceit may lead to self destruction     the cock and the pearl  a cock was once strutting up and down the farmyard among the hens when suddenly he espied something shining and the straw    ho  ho   quoth he   that s for me   and soon rooted it out from beneath the straw  what did it turn out to be but a pearl that by some chance had been lost in the yard    you may be a treasure   quoth master cock   to men that prize you  but for me i would rather have a single barley corn than a peck of pearls     precious things are for those that can prize them     the fox without a tail  it happened that a fox caught its tail in a trap  and in struggling to release himself lost all of it but the stump   at first he was ashamed to show himself among his fellow foxes   but at last he determined to put a bolder face upon his misfortune  and summoned all the foxes to a general meeting to consider a proposal which he had to place before them   when they had assembled together the fox proposed that they should all do away with their tails   he pointed out how inconvenient a tail was when they were pursued by their enemies  the dogs  how much it was in the way when they desired to sit down and hold a friendly conversation with one another   he failed to see any advantage in carrying about such a useless encumbrance    that is all very well   said one of the older foxes   but i do not think you would have recommended us to dispense with our chief ornament if you had not happened to lose it yourself     distrust interested advice     the fox and the cat  a fox was boasting to a cat of its clever devices for escaping its enemies    i have a whole bag of tricks   he said   which contains a hundred ways of escaping my enemies     i have only one   said the cat   but i can generally manage with that    just at that moment they heard the cry of a pack of hounds coming toward them  and the cat immediately scampered up a tree and hid herself in the boughs    this is my plan   said the cat    what are you going to do    the fox thought first of one way  then of another  and while he was debating the hounds came nearer and nearer  and at last the fox in his confusion was caught up by the hounds and soon killed by the huntsmen   miss puss  who had been looking on  said    better one safe way than a hundred  on which you cannot  reckon     the dog in the manger a dog looking out for its afternoon nap jumped into the manger of an ox and lay there cosily upon the straw   but soon the ox  returning from its afternoon work  came up to the manger and wanted to eat some of the straw   the dog in a rage  being awakened from its slumber  stood up and barked at the ox  and whenever it came near attempted to bite it  at last the ox had to give up the hope of getting at the straw  and went away muttering    ah  people often grudge others  what they cannot enjoy  themselves     the fox and the goat  by an unlucky chance a fox fell into a deep well from which he could not get out   a goat passed by shortly afterward  and asked the fox what he was doing down there    oh  have you not heard   said the fox   there is going to be a great drought  so i jumped down here in order to be sure to have water by me   why don t you come down  too    the goat thought well of this advice  and jumped down into the well   but the fox immediately jumped on her back  and by putting his foot on her long horns managed to jump up to the edge of the well    good by  friend   said the fox    remember next time    never trust the advice of a man  in difficulties     belling the cat  long ago  the mice held a general council to consider what measures they could take to outwit their common enemy  the cat   some said this  and some said that  but at last a young mouse got up and said he had a proposal to make  which he thought would meet the case    you will all agree   said he   that our chief danger consists in the sly and treacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us   now  if we could receive some signal of her approach  we could easily escape from her  i venture  therefore  to propose that a small bell be procured  and attached by a ribbon round the neck of the cat   by this means we should always know when she was about  and could easily retire while she was in the neighborhood    this proposed met with general applause  until an old mouse got up and said   that is all very well  but who is to bell the cat    the mice looked at one another and nobody spoke   then the old mouse said    it is easy to propose impossible  remedies     the jay and the peacock  a jay venturing into a yard where peacocks used to walk  found there a number of feathers which had fallen from the peacocks when they were moulting   he tied them all to his tail and strutted down toward the peacocks   when he came near them they soon discovered the cheat  and striding up to him pecked at him and plucked away his borrowed plumes  so the jay could do no better than go back to the other jays  who had watched his behavior from a distance  but they were equally annoyed with him  and told him   it is not only fine feathers that  make fine birds     the ass and the lap dog  a farmer one day came to the stables to see to his beasts of burden  among them was his favorite ass  that was always well fed and often carried his master   with the farmer came his lap dog  who danced about and licked his hand and frisked about as happy as could be   the farmer felt in his pocket  gave the lap dog some dainty food  and sat down while he gave his orders to his servants   the lap dog jumped into his master s lap  and lay there blinking while the farmer stroked his ears  the ass  seeing this  broke loose from his halter and commenced prancing about in imitation of the lap dog   the farmer could not hold his sides with laughter  so the ass went up to him  and putting his feet upon the farmer s shoulder attempted to climb into his lap   the farmer s servants rushed up with sticks and pitchforks and soon taught the ass that   clumsy jesting is no joke     the ant and the grasshopper  in a field one summer s day a grasshopper was hopping about  chirping and singing to its heart s content   an ant passed by  bearing along with great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the nest    why not come and chat with me   said the grasshopper   instead of toiling and moiling in that way     i am helping to lay up food for the winter   said the ant   and recommend you to do the same     why bother about winter    said the grasshopper   we have got plenty of food at present    but the ant went on its way and continued its toil   then the winter came the grasshopper had no food  and found itself dying of hunger  while it saw the ants distributing every day corn and grain from the stores they had collected in the summer   then the grasshopper knew  it is best to prepare for the days  of necessity    the woodman and the serpent  one wintry day a woodman was tramping home from his work when he saw something black lying on the snow   when he came closer  he saw it was a serpent to all appearance dead   but he took it up and put it in his bosom to warm while he hurried home   as soon as he got indoors he put the serpent down on the hearth before the fire   the children watched it and saw it slowly come to life again   then one of them stooped down to stroke it  but the serpent raised its head and put out its fangs and was about to sting the child to death   so the woodman seized his axe  and with one stroke cut the serpent in two    ah   said he    no gratitude from the wicked     the milkmaid and her pail  patty  the milkmaid  was going to market carrying her milk in a pail on her head   as she went along she began calculating what she would do with the money she would get for the milk    i ll buy some fowls from farmer brown   said she   and they will lay eggs each morning  which i will sell to the parson s wife   with the money that i get from the sale of these eggs i ll buy myself a new dimity frock and a chip hat  and when i go to market  won t all the young men come up and speak to me   polly shaw will be that jealous  but i don t care   i shall just look at her and toss my head like this    as she spoke  she tossed her head back  the pail fell off it and all the milk was spilt   so she had to go home and tell her mother what had occurred   ah  my child   said her mother   do not count your chickens before  they are hatched    the lion and the mouse  once when a lion was asleep a little mouse began running up and down upon him  this soon wakened the lion  who placed his huge paw upon him  and opened his big jaws to swallow him    pardon  o king   cried the little mouse   forgive me this time  i shall never forget it  who knows but what i may be able to do you a turn some of these days    the lion was so tickled at the idea of the mouse being able to help him  that he lifted up his paw and let him go   some time after the lion was caught in a trap  and the hunters  who desired to carry him alive to the king  tied him to a tree while they went in search of a wagon to carry him on   just then the little mouse happened to pass by  and seeing the sad plight in which the lion was  went up to him and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the king of the beasts    was i not right   said the little mouse    little friends may prove great  friends     hercules and the wagoner  a wagoner was once driving a heavy load along a very muddy way   at last he came to a part of the road where the wheels sank halfway into the mire  and the more the horses pulled  the deeper sank the wheels  so the wagoner threw down his whip  and knelt down and prayed to hercules the strong    o hercules  help me in this my hour of distress   quote he   but hercules appeared to him  and said    tut  man  don t sprawl there   get up and put your shoulder to the wheel     the gods help them that help  themselves     the lion s share  the lion went once a hunting along with the fox  the jackal  and the wolf   they hunted and they hunted till at last they surprised a stag  and soon took its life   then came the question how the spoil should be divided    quarter me this stag   roared the lion  so the other animals skinned it and cut it into four parts   then the lion took his stand in front of the carcass and pronounced judgment   the first quarter is for me in my capacity as king of beasts  the second is mine as arbiter  another share comes to me for my part in the chase  and as far the fourth quarter  well  as for that  i should like to see which of you will dare to lay a paw upon it     humph    grumbled the fox as he walked away with his tail between his legs  but he spoke in a low growl    you may share the labors of the  great  but you will not share  the spoil     the fox and the crow  a fox once saw a crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its beak and settle on a branch of a tree    that s for me  as i am a fox   said master reynard  and he walked up to the foot of the tree    good day  mistress crow   he cried    how well you are looking to day  how glossy your feathers  how bright your eye   i feel sure your voice must surpass that of other birds  just as your figure does  let me hear but one song from you that i may greet you as the queen of birds    the crow lifted up her head and began to caw her best  but the moment she opened her mouth the piece of cheese fell to the ground  only to be snapped up by master fox    that will do   said he    that was all i wanted   in exchange for your cheese i will give you a piece of advice for the future    do not trust flatterers    the dog and the shadow  it happened that a dog had got a piece of meat and was carrying it home in his mouth to eat it in peace   now on his way home he had to cross a plank lying across a running brook   as he crossed  he looked down and saw his own shadow reflected in the water beneath   thinking it was another dog with another piece of meat  he made up his mind to have that also   so he made a snap at the shadow in the water  but as he opened his mouth the piece of meat fell out  dropped into the water and was never seen more    beware lest you lose the substance  by grasping at the shadow     the wolf and the lamb  once upon a time a wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside  when  looking up  what should he see but a lamb just beginning to drink a little lower down    there s my supper   thought he   if only i can find some excuse to seize it    then he called out to the lamb   how dare you muddle the water from which i am drinking     nay  master  nay   said lambikin   if the water be muddy up there  i cannot be the cause of it  for it runs down from you to me     well  then   said the wolf   why did you call me bad names this time last year     that cannot be   said the lamb   i am only six months old     i don t care   snarled the wolf   if it was not you it was your father   and with that he rushed upon the poor little lamb and   warra warra warra warra warra   ate her all up   but before  she died she gasped out    any excuse will serve a tyrant     the bat  the birds  and the beasts  a great conflict was about to come off between the birds and the beasts   when the two armies were collected together the bat hesitated which to join   the birds that passed his perch said   come with us   but he said   i am a beast    later on  some beasts who were passing underneath him looked up and said   come with us   but he said   i am a bird    luckily at the last moment peace was made  and no battle took place  so the bat came to the birds and wished to join in the rejoicings  but they all turned against him and he had to fly away   he then went to the beasts  but soon had to beat a retreat  or else they would have torn him to pieces    ah   said the bat   i see now  he that is neither one thing nor  the other has no friends     the belly and the members  one fine day it occurred to the members of the body that they were doing all the work and the belly was having all the food   so they held a meeting  and after a long discussion  decided to strike work till the belly consented to take its proper share of the work   so for a day or two the hands refused to take the food  the mouth refused to receive it  and the teeth had no work to do   but after a day or two the members began to find that they themselves were not in a very active condition  the hands could hardly move  and the mouth was all parched and dry  while the legs were unable to support the rest   so thus they found that even the belly in its dull quiet way was doing necessary work for the body  and that all must work together or the body will go to pieces    the fox and the grapes  one hot summer s day a fox was strolling through an orchard till he came to a bunch of grapes just ripening on a vine which had been trained over a lofty branch    just the thing to quench my thirst   quoth he   drawing back a few paces  he took a run and a jump  and just missed the bunch   turning round again with a one  two  three  he jumped up  but with no greater success   again and again he tried after the tempting morsel  but at last had to give it up  and walked away with his nose in the air  saying   i am sure they are sour     it is easy to despise what you  cannot get     the swallow and the other birds  it happened that a countryman was sowing some hemp seed in a field where a swallow and some other birds were hopping about picking up their food    beware of that man   quoth the swallow    why  what is he doing   said the others    that is hemp seed he is sowing  be careful to pick up every one of the seeds  or else you will repent it    the birds paid no heed to the swallow s words  and by and by the hemp grew up and was made into cord  and of the cords nets were made  and many a bird that had despised the swallow s advice was caught in nets made out of that very hemp    what did i tell you   said the swallow    destroy the seed of evil  or it  will grow up to your ruin             this etext was produced by douglas e  levy

these   pages                  emma lazarus   written for  the century magazine                  born july 22  1849  died november 19  1887     one hesitates to lift the veil and throw the light upon a life so hidden and a personality so withdrawn as that of emma lazarus  but while her memory is fresh  and the echo of her songs still lingers in these pages  we feel it a duty to call up her presence once more  and to note the traits that made it remarkable and worthy to shine out clearly before the world   of dramatic episode or climax in her life there is none  outwardly all was placid and serene  like an untroubled stream whose depths alone hold the strong  quick tide  the story of her life is the story of a mind  of a spirit  ever seeking  ever striving  and pressing onward and upward to new truth and light   her works are the mirror of this progress   in reviewing them  the first point that strikes us is the precocity  or rather the spontaneity  of her poetic gift   she was a born singer  poetry was her natural language  and to write was less effort than to speak  for she was a shy  sensitive child  with strange reserves and reticences  not easily putting herself  en rapport  with those around her   books were her world from her earliest years  in them she literally lost and found herself   she was eleven years old when the war of succession broke out  which inspired her first lyric outbursts  her poems and translations written between the ages of fourteen and seventeen were collected  and constituted her first published volume  crude and immature as these productions naturally were  and utterly condemned by the writer s later judgment  they are  nevertheless  highly interesting and characteristic  giving  as they do  the keynote of much that afterwards unfolded itself in her life   one cannot fail to be rather painfully impressed by the profound melancholy pervading the book   the opening poem is  in memoriam     on the death of a school friend and companion  and the two following poems also have death for theme    on a lock of my mother s hair  gives us reflections on growing old   these are the four poems written at the age of fourteen   there is not a wholly glad and joyous strain in the volume  and we might smile at the recurrence of broken vows  broken hearts  and broken lives in the experience of this maiden just entered upon her teens  were it not that the innocent child herself is in such deadly earnest   the two long narrative poems   bertha  and  elfrida   are tragic in the extreme   both are dashed off apparently at white heat   elfrida   over fifteen hundred lines of blank verse  in two weeks   bertha   in three and a half   we have said that emma lazarus was a born singer  but she did not sing  like a bird  for joy of being alive  and of being young  alas  there is no hint in these youthful effusions  except inasmuch as this unrelieved gloom  this ignorance of  values   so to speak  is a sign of youth  common especially among gifted persons of acute and premature sensibilities  whose imagination  not yet focused by reality  overreached the mark  with emma lazarus  however  this sombre streak has a deeper root  something of birth and temperament is in it  the stamp and heritage of a race born to suffer   but dominant and fundamental though it was  hebraism was only latent thus far   it was classic and romantic art that first attracted and inspired her   she pictures aphrodite the beautiful  arising from the waves  and the beautiful apollo and his loves   daphne  pursued by the god  changing into the laurel  and the enamored clytie into the faithful sunflower   beauty  for its own sake  supreme and unconditional  charmed her primarily and to the end  her restless spirit found repose in the pagan idea   the absolute unity and identity of man with nature  as symbolized in the greek myths  where every natural force becomes a person  and where  in turn  persons pass with equal readiness and freedom back into nature again   in this connection a name would suggest itself even if it did not appear   heine  the greek  heine the jew  heine the romanticist  as emma lazarus herself has styled him  and already in this early volume of hers we have trace of the kinship and affinity that afterwards so plainly declared itself   foremost among the translations are a number of his songs  rendered with a finesse and a literalness that are rarely combined   four years later  at the age of twenty one  she published her second volume   admetus and other poems   which at once took rank as literature both in america and england  and challenged comparison with the work of established writers   of classic themes we have  admetus  and  orpheus   and of romantic the legend of tannhauser and of the saintly lohengrin   all are treated with an artistic finish that shows perfect mastery of her craft  without detracting from the freshness and flow of her inspiration  while sounding no absolutely new note in the world  she yet makes us aware of a talent of unusual distinction  and a highly endowed nature   a sort of tact of sentiment and expression  an instinct of the true and beautiful  and that quick intuition which is like second sight in its sensitiveness to apprehend and respond to external stimulus   but it is not the purely imaginative poems in this volume that most deeply interest us   we come upon experience of life in these pages  not in the ordinary sense  however  of outward activity and movement  but in the hidden undercurrent of being    the epochs of our life are not in the visible facts  but in the silent thoughts by the wayside as we walk    this is the motto  drawn from emerson  which she chooses for her poem of  epochs   which marks a pivotal moment in her life   difficult to analyze  difficult above all to convey  if we would not encroach upon the domain of private and personal experience  is the drift of this poem  or rather cycle of poems  that ring throughout with a deeper accent and a more direct appeal than has yet made itself felt   it is the drama of the human soul    the mystic winged and flickering butterfly    flitting between earth and sky   in its passage from birth to death   a golden morning of june    sweet empty sky without a stain   sunlight and mist and  ripple of rain fed rills     a murmur and a singing manifold                  what simple things be these the soul to raise              to bounding joy  and make young pulses beat              with nameless pleasure  finding life so sweet     such is youth  a june day  fair and fresh and tender with dreams and longing and vague desire  the morn lingers and passes  but the noon has not reached its height before the clouds begin to rise  the sunshine dies  the air grows thick and heavy  the lightnings flash  the thunder breaks among the hills  rolls and gathers and grows  until                      behold  yon bolt struck home               and over ruined fields the storm hath come     now we have the phases of the soul   the shock and surprise of grief in the face of the world made desolate   loneliness and despair for a space  and then  like stars in the night  the new births of the spirit  the wonderful outcoming from sorrow  the mild light of patience at first  hope and faith kindled afresh in the very jaws of evil  the new meaning and worth of life beyond sorrow  beyond joy  and finally duty  the holiest word of all  that leads at last to victory and peace   the poem rounds and completes itself with the close of  the long  rich day   and the release of               the mystic winged and flickering butterfly              a human soul  that drifts at liberty              ah  who can tell to what strange paradise              to what undreamed of fields and lofty skies     we have dwelt at some length upon this poem  which seems to us  in a certain sense  subjective and biographical  but upon closer analysis there is still another conclusion to arrive at   in  epochs  we have  doubtless  the impress of a calamity brought very near to the writer  and profoundly working upon her sensibilities  not however by direct  but reflex action  as it were  and through sympathetic emotion  the emotion of the deeply stirred spectator  of the artist  the poet who lives in the lives of others  and makes their joys and their sorrows his own   before dismissing this volume we may point out another clue as to the shaping of mind and character   the poem of  admetus  is dedicated  to my friend ralph waldo emerson    emma lazarus was between seventeen and eighteen years of age when the writings of emerson fell into her hands  and it would be difficult to over estimate the impression produced upon her   as she afterwards wrote   to how many thousand youthful hearts has not his word been the beacon  nay  more  the guiding star  that led them safely through periods of mental storm and struggle    of no one is this more true than herself  left  to a certain extent  without compass or guide  without any positive or effective religious training  this was the first great moral revelation of her life   we can easily realize the chaos and ferment of an over stimulated brain  steeped in romantic literature  and given over to the wayward leadings of the imagination   who can tell what is true  what is false  in a world where fantasy is as real as fact   emerson s word fell like truth itself   a shaft of light shot from the zenith   a golden rule of thought and action   his books were bread and wine to her  and she absorbed them into her very being   she felt herself invincibly drawn to the master   that fount of wisdom and goodness   and it was her great privilege during these years to be brought into personal relations with him   from the first he showed her a marked interest and sympathy  which became for her one of the most valued possessions of her life   he criticised her work with the fine appreciation and discrimination that made him quick to discern the quality of her talent as well as of her personality  and he was no doubt attracted by her almost transparent sincerity and singleness of soul  as well as by the simplicity and modesty that would have been unusual even in a person not gifted  he constituted himself  in a way  her literary mentor  advised her as to the books she should read and the attitude of mind she should cultivate   for some years he corresponded with her very faithfully  his letters are full of noble and characteristic utterances  and give evidence of a warm regard that in itself was a stimulus and a high incentive   but encouragement even from so illustrious a source failed to elate the young poetess  or even to give her a due sense of the importance and value of her work  or the dignity of her vocation   we have already alluded to her modesty in her unwillingness to assert herself or claim any prerogative   something even morbid and exaggerated  which we know not how to define  whether as over  sensitiveness or indifference   once finished  the heat and glow of composition spent  her writings apparently ceased to interest her  she often resented any allusion to them on the part of intimate friends  and the public verdict as to their excellence could not reassure or satisfy her   the explanation is not far  perhaps  to seek   was it not the  ewig weibliche  that allows no prestige but its own   emma lazarus was a true woman  too distinctly feminine to wish to be exceptional  or to stand alone and apart  even by virtue of superiority   a word now as to her life and surroundings   she was one of a family of seven  and her parents were both living   her winters were passed in new york  and her summers by the sea   in both places her life was essentially quiet and retired   the success of her book had been mainly in the world of letters   in no wise tricked out to catch the public eye  her writings had not yet made her a conspicuous figure  but were destined slowly to take their proper place and give her the rank that she afterwards held   for some years now almost everything that she wrote was published in  lippincott s magazine   then edited by john foster kirk  and we shall still find in her poems the method and movement of her life  nature is still the fount and mirror  reflecting  and again reflected  in the soul   we have picture after picture  almost to satiety  until we grow conscious of a lack of substance and body and of vital play to the thought  as though the brain were spending itself in dreamings and reverie  the heart feeding upon itself  and the life choked by its own fullness without due outlet   happily  however  the heavy cloud of sadness has lifted  and we feel the subsidence of waves after a storm   she sings  matins                          does not the morn break thus                     swift  bright  victorious                     with new skies cleared for us                    over the soul storm tost                     her night was long and deep                     strange visions vexed her sleep                     strange sorrows bade her weep                     her faith in dawn was lost                       no halt  no rest for her                     the immortal wanderer                    from sphere to higher sphere                    toward the pure source of day                     the new light shames her fears                     her faithlessness and tears                     as the new sun appears                    to light her god like way     nature is the perpetual resource and consolation    t is good to be alive   she says  and why   simply                                 to see the light             that plays upon the grass  to feel  and sigh             with perfect pleasure  the mild breeze stir               among the garden roses  red and white                  with whiffs of fragrancy     she gives us the breath of the pines and of the cool  salt seas   illimitably sparkling    her ears drink the ripple of the tide  and she stops            to gaze as one who is not satisfied          with gazing at the large  bright  breathing sea      phantasies   after robert schumann  is the most complete and perfect poem of this period   like  epochs   it is a cycle of poems  and the verse has caught the very trick of music   alluring  baffling  and evasive   this time we have the landscape of the night  the glamour of moon and stars   pictures half real and half unreal  mystic imaginings  fancies  dreams  and the enchantment of  faerie   and throughout the unanswered cry  the eternal  wherefore  of destiny  dawn ends the song with a fine clear note  the return of day  night s misty phantoms rolled away  and the world itself  again green  sparkling and breathing freshness   in 1874 she published  alide   a romance in prose drawn from goethe s autobiography   it may be of interest to quote the letter she received from tourgeneff on this occasion           although  generally speaking  i do not think it advisable     to take celebrated men  especially poets and artists  as a     subject for a novel  still i am truly glad to say that i     have read your book with the liveliest interest   it is     very sincere and very poetical at the same time  the life     and spirit of germany have no secrets for you  and your     characters are drawn with a pencil as delicate as it is     strong   i feel very proud of the approbation you give to     my works  and of the influence you kindly attribute to them     on your own talent  an author who write as you do is not     a pupil in art any more  he is not far from being himself     a master     charming and graceful words  of which the young writer was justly proud   about this time occurred the death of her mother  the first break in the home and family circle   in august of 1876 she made a visit to concord  at the emersons   memorable enough for her to keep a journal and note down every incident and detail   very touching to read now  in its almost childlike simplicity  is this record of  persons that pass and shadows that remain    mr  emerson himself meets her at the station  and drives with her in his little one horse wagon to his home  the gray square house  with dark green blinds  set amidst noble trees   a glimpse of the family    the stately  white haired mrs  emerson  and the beautiful  faithful ellen  whose figure seems always to stand by the side of her august father    then the picture of concord itself  lovely and smiling  with its quiet meadows  quiet slopes  and quietest of rivers   she meets the little set of concord people  mr  alcott  for whom she does not share mr  emerson s enthusiasm  and william ellery channing  whose figure stands out like a gnarled and twisted scrub oak   a pathetic  impossible creature  whose cranks and oddities were submitted to on account of an innate nobility of character    generally crabbed and reticent with strangers  he took a liking to me   says emma lazarus    the bond of our sympathy was my admiration for thoreau  whose memory he actually worships  having been his constant companion in his best days  and his daily attendant in the last years of illness and heroic suffering   i do not know whether i was most touched by the thought of the unique  lofty character that had inspired this depth and fervor of friendship  or by the pathetic constancy and pure affection of the poor  desolate old man before me  who tried to conceal his tenderness and sense of irremediable loss by a show of gruffness and philosophy   he never speaks of thoreau s death   she says   but always  thoreau s loss   or  when i lost mr  thoreau   or  when mr  thoreau went away from concord   nor would he confess that he missed him  for there was not a day  an hour  a moment  when he did not feel that his friend was still with him and had never left him   and yet a day or two after   she goes on to say   when i sat with him in the sunlit wood  looking at the gorgeous blue and silver summer sky  he turned to me and said   just half of the world died for me when i lost mr  thoreau   none of it looks the same as when i looked at it with him        he took me through the woods and pointed out to me every spot visited and described by his friend   where the hut stood is a little pile of stones  and a sign   site of thoreau s hut   and a few steps beyond is the pond with thickly wooded shore   everything exquisitely peaceful and beautiful in the afternoon light  and not a sound to be heard except the crickets or the  z ing  of the locusts which thoreau has described   farther on he pointed out to me  in the distant landscape  a low roof  the only one visible  which was the roof of thoreau s birthplace   he had been over there many times  he said  since he lost mr  thoreau  but had never gone in   he was afraid it might look lonely   but he had often sat on a rock in front of the house and looked at it    on parting from his young friend  mr  channing gave her a package  which proved to be a copy of his own book on thoreau  and the pocket compass which thoreau carried to the maine woods and on all his excursions   before leaving the emersons she received the proof sheets of her drama of  the spagnoletto   which was being printed for private circulation   she showed them to mr  emerson  who had expressed a wish to see them  and  after reading them  he gave them back to her with the comment that they were  good    she playfully asked him if he would not give her a bigger word to take home to the family   he laughed  and said he did not know of any  but he went on to tell her that he had taken it up  not expecting to read it through  and had not been able to put it down   every word and line told of richness in the poetry  he said  and as far as he could judge the play had great dramatic opportunities   early in the autumn  the spagnoletto  appeared   a tragedy in five acts  the scene laid in italy  1655   without a doubt  every one in these days will take up with misgiving  and like mr  emerson  not expecting to read it through   a five act tragedy of the seventeenth century  so far removed apparently from the age and present actualities   so opposed to the  modernite   which has come to be the last word of art   moreover  great names at once appear  great shades arise to rebuke the presumptuous new comer in this highest realm of expression    the spagnoletto  has grave defects that would probably preclude its ever being represented on the stage   the denoument especially is unfortunate  and sins against our moral and aesthetic instinct   the wretched  tiger like father stabs himself in the presence of his crushed and erring daughter  so that she may forever be haunted by the horror and the retribution of his death   we are left suspended  as it were  over an abyss  our moral judgment thwarted  our humanity outraged   but  the spagnoletto  is  nevertheless  a remarkable production  and pitched in another key from anything the writer has yet given us   heretofore we have only had quiet  reflective  passive emotion  now we have a storm and sweep of passion for which we were quite unprepared  ribera s character is charged like a thunder cloud with dramatic elements  maria rosa is the child of her father  fired at a flash   deaf  dumb  and blind  at the touch of passion                   does love steal gently o er our soul    she asks                             what if he come                   a cloud  a fire  a whirlwind    and then the cry                                o my god              this awful joy in mine own heart is love    again                while you are here the one thing real to me             in all the universe is love     exquisitely tender and refined are the love scenes  at the ball and in the garden  between the dashing prince lover in search of his pleasure and the devoted girl with her heart in her eyes  on her lips  in her hand   behind them  always like a tragic fate  the somber figure of the spagnoletto  and over all the glow and color and soul of italy   in 1881 appeared the translation of heine s poems and ballads  which was generally accepted as the best version of that untranslatable poet   very curious is the link between that bitter  mocking  cynic spirit and the refined  gentle spirit of emma lazarus   charmed by the magic of his verse  the iridescent play of his fancy  and the sudden cry of the heart piercing through it all  she is as yet unaware or only vaguely conscious of the of the real bond between them  the sympathy in the blood  the deep  tragic  judaic passion of eighteen hundred years that was smouldering in her own heart  soon to break out and change the whole current of thought and feeling   already  in 1879  the storm was gathering   in a distant province of russia at first  then on the banks of the volga  and finally in moscow itself  the old cry was raised  the hideous mediaeval charge revived  and the standard of persecution unfurled against the jews  province after province took it up   in bulgaria  servia  and  above all  roumania  where  we were told  the sword of the czar had been drawn to protect the oppressed  christian atrocities took the place of moslem atrocities  and history turned a page backward into the dark annals of violence and crime   and not alone in despotic russia  but in germany  the seat of modern philosophic thought and culture  the rage of anti semitism broke out and spread with fatal ease and potency  in berlin itself tumults and riots were threatened   we in america could scarcely comprehend the situation or credit the reports  and for a while we shut our eyes and ears to the facts  but we were soon rudely awakened from our insensibility  and forced to face the truth  it was in england that the voice was first raised in behalf of justice and humanity   in january  1881  there appeared in the  london times  a series of articles  carefully compiled on the testimony of eye witnesses  and confirmed by official documents  records  etc   giving an account of events that had been taking place in southern and western russia during a period of nine months  between april and december of 1880   we do not need to recall the sickening details   the headings will suffice  outrage  murder  arson  and pillage  and the result   100 000 jewish families made homeless and destitute  and nearly  100 000 000 worth of property destroyed  nor need we recall the generous outburst of sympathy and indignation from america    it is not that it is the oppression of jews by russia   said mr  evarts in the meeting at chickering hall wednesday evening  february 4   it is that it is the oppression of men and women  and we are men and women    so spoke civilized christendom  and for judaism    who can describe that thrill of brotherhood  quickened anew  the immortal pledge of the race  made one again through sorrow   for emma lazarus it was a trumpet call that awoke slumbering and unguessed echoes   all this time she had been seeking heroic ideals in alien stock  soulless and far removed  in pagan mythology and mystic  mediaeval christianity  ignoring her very birthright   the majestic vista of the past  down which   high above flood and fire   had been conveyed the precious scroll of the moral law   hitherto judaism had been a dead letter to her   of portuguese descent  her family had always been members of the oldest and most orthodox congregation of new york  where strict adherence to custom and ceremonial was the watchword of faith  but it was only during her childhood and earliest years that she attended the synagogue  and conformed to the prescribed rites and usages which she had now long since abandoned as obsolete and having no bearing on modern life   nor had she any great enthusiasm for her own people   as late as april  1882  she published in  the century magazine  an article written probably some months before  entitled  was the earl of beaconsfield a representative jew   in which she is disposed to accept as the type of the modern jew the brilliant  successful  but not over scrupulous chevalier d industrie   in view of subsequent  or rather contemporaneous events  the closing paragraph of the article in question is worthy  of being cited           thus far their religion  the jewish   whose mere preservation     under such adverse conditions seems little short of a miracle      has been deprived of the natural means of development and     progress  and has remained a stationary force   the next     hundred years will  in our opinion be the test of their     vitality as a people  the phase of toleration upon which     they are only now entering will prove whether or not they     are capable of growth     by a curious  almost fateful juxtaposition  in the same number of the magazine appeared madame ragozin s defense of russian barbarity  and in the following  may  number emma lazarus s impassioned appeal and reply   russian christianity versus modern judaism    from this time dated the crusade that she undertook in behalf of her race  and the consequent expansion of all her faculties  the growth of spiritual power which always ensues when a great cause is espoused and a strong conviction enters the soul   her verse rang out as it had never rung before   a clarion note  calling a people to heroic action and unity  to the consciousness and fulfillment of a grand destiny   when has judaism been so stirred as by  the crowing of the red cock  and                         the banner of the jew                 wake  israel  wake   recall to day

blast to ope the graves  down poured               the maccabean clan  who sang               their battle anthem to the lord                five heroes lead  and following  see               ten

even they who slept                shall leap to bless it and to save                strike  for the brave revere the brave    the dead forms burst their bonds and lived again   she sings  rosh

by twenty scorching centuries of wrong           is this the house of israel whose pride          is as a tale that s told  an ancient song           are these ignoble relics all that live          of

         say to the wind  come forth and breathe afresh           even that they may live  upon these slain           and bone to bone shall leap  and flesh to flesh           the spirit is not dead  proclaim the word           where lay dead bones a host of armed men stand           i ope your graves  my people  saith the lord           and i shall place you living in your land     her whole being renewed and refreshed itself at its very source   she threw herself into the study of her race  its language  literature  and history   breaking the outward crust  she pierced to the heart of the faith and  the miracle  of its survival   what was it other than the ever  present  ever vivifying spirit itself  which cannot die   the religious and ethical zeal which fires the whole history of the people  and of which she herself felt the living glow within her own soul   she had come upon the secret and the genius of judaism   that absolute interpenetration and transfusion of spirit with body and substance which  taken literally  often reduces itself to a question of food and drink  a dietary regulation  and again  in proper splendor  incarnates itself and shines out before humanity in the prophets  teachers  and saviors of mankind   those were busy  fruitful years for emma lazarus  who worked  not with the pen alone  but in the field of practical and beneficent activity   for there was an immense task to accomplish   the tide of immigration had set in  and ship after ship came laden with hunted human beings flying from their fellow men  while all the time  like a tocsin  rang the terrible story of cruelty and persecution   horrors that the pen refuses to dwell upon   by the hundreds and thousands they flocked upon our shores   helpless  innocent victims of injustice and oppression  panic stricken in the midst of strange and utterly new surroundings   emma lazarus came into personal contact with these people  and visited them in their refuge on ward island   while under the influence of all the emotions aroused by this great crisis in the history of her race  she wrote the  dance of death   a drama of persecution of the twelfth century  founded upon the authentic records    unquestionably her finest work in grasp and scope  and  above all  in moral elevation and purport   the scene is laid in nordhausen  a free city in thuringia  where the jews  living  as the deemed  in absolute security and peace  were caught up in the wave of persecution that swept over europe at that time   accused of poisoning the wells and causing the pestilence  or black death  as it was called  they were condemned to be burned   we do not here intend to enter upon a critical or literary analysis of the play  or to point out dramatic merits or defects  but we should like to make its readers feel with us the holy ardor and impulse of the writer and the spiritual import of the work   the action is without surprise  the doom fixed from the first  but so glowing is the canvas with local and historic color  so vital and intense the movement  so resistless  the  internal evidence   if we may call it thus  penetrating its very substance and form  that we are swept along as by a wave of human sympathy and grief   in contrast with  the spagnoletto   how large is the theme and how all embracing the catastrophe   in place of the personal we have the drama of the universal   love is only a flash now   a dream caught sight of and at once renounced at a higher claim             have you no smile to welcome love with  liebhaid           why should you tremble           prince  i am afraid           afraid of my own heart  my unfathomed joy           a blasphemy against my father s grief           my people s agony             what good shall come  forswearing kith and god           to follow the allurements of the heart     asks the distracted maiden  torn between her love for he princely wooer and her devotion to the people among whom her lot has been cast                                           o god              how shall i pray for strength to love him less             than mine own soul                                         no more of that              i am all israel s now   till this cloud pass              i have no thought  no passion  no desire              save for my people     individuals perish  but great ideas survive   fortitude and courage  and that exalted loyalty and devotion to principle which alone are worth living and dying for   the jews pass by in procession  men  women  and children  on their way to the flames  to the sound of music  and in festal array  carrying the gold and silver vessels  the roll of the law  the perpetual lamp and the seven branched silver candle stick of the synagogue   the crowd hoot and jeer at them                the misers  they will take their gems and gold             down to the grave                                   let us rejoice    sing the jewish youths in chorus  and the maidens                  our feet stand within thy gates  o zion               within thy portals  o jerusalem     the flames rise and dart among them  their garments wave  their jewels flash  as they dance and sing in the crimson blaze   the music ceases  a sound of crashing boards is heard and a great cry    hallelujah   what a glory and consecration of the martyrdom   where shall we find a more triumphant vindication and supreme victory of spirit over matter                                 i see  i see           how israel s ever crescent glory makes          these flames that would eclipse it dark as blots          of candle light against the blazing sun           we die a thousand deaths   drown  bleed  and burn           our ashes are dispersed unto the winds           yet the wild winds cherish the sacred seed           the fire refuseth to consume                                                                   even as we die in honor  from our death          shall bloom a myriad heroic lives           brave through our bright example  virtuous          lest our great memory fall in disrepute     the  dance to death  was published  along with other poems and translations from the hebrew poets of mediaeval spain  in a small column entitled  songs of a semite    the tragedy was dedicated   in profound veneration and respect to the memory of george eliot  the illustrious writer who did most among the artists of our day towards elevating and ennobling the spirit of jewish nationality    for this was the idea that had caught the imagination of emma lazarus    a restored and independent nationality and repatriation in palestine  in her article in  the century  of february  1883  on the  jewish problem   she says           i am fully persuaded that all suggested solutions other     than this are but temporary palliatives        the idea     formulated by george eliot has already sunk into the minds     of many jewish enthusiasts  and it germinates with miraculous     rapidity    the idea that i am possessed with   says deronda       is that of restoring a political existence to my people      making them a nation again  giving them a national centre      such as the english have  though they  too  are scattered     over the face of the globe   that task which presents itself     to me as a duty        i am resolved to devote my life to     it   at the least  i may awaken a movement in other minds     such has been awakened in my own    could the noble     prophetess who wrote the above words have lived but till to      day to see the ever increasing necessity of adopting her     inspired counsel       she would have been herself astonished     at the flame enkindled by her seed of fire  and the practical     shape which the movement projected by her poetic vision is     beginning to assume     in november of 1882 appeared her first  epistle to the hebrews     one of a series of articles written for the  american hebrew   published weekly through several months   addressing herself now to a jewish audience  she sets forth without reserve her views and hopes for judaism  now passionately holding up the mirror for the shortcomings and peculiarities of her race   she says           every student of the hebrew language is aware that we have     in the conjugation of our verbs a mode known as the  intensive     voice   which  by means of an almost imperceptible modification     of vowel points  intensifies the meaning of the primitive root      a similar significance seems to attach to the jews themselves     in connection with the people among whom they dwell   they are     the  intensive form  of any nationality whose language and     customs they adopt        influenced by the same causes  they     represent the same results  but the deeper lights and shadows     of the oriental temperament throw their failings  as well as     their virtues  into more prominent relief     in drawing the epistles to a close  february 24  1883  she thus summarizes the special objects she has had in view           my chief aim has been to contribute my mite towards arousing     that spirit of jewish enthusiasm which might manifest itself      first  in a return to varied pursuits and broad system of     physical and intellectual education adopted by our ancestors      second  in a more fraternal and practical movement towards     alleviating the sufferings of oppressed jews in countries less     favored than our own  third  in a closer and wider study of     hebrew literature and history and finally  in a truer recognition     of the large principals of religion  liberty  and law upon     which judaism is founded  and which should draw into harmonious     unity jews of every shade of opinion     her interest in jewish affairs was at its height when she planned a visit abroad  which had been a long cherished dream  and may 15  1883  she sailed for england  accompanied by a younger sister   we have difficulty in recognizing the tragic priestess we have been portraying in the enthusiastic child of travel who seems new born into a new world   from the very outset she is in a maze of wonder and delight  at sea she writes           our last day on board ship was a vision of beauty from     morning till night   the sea like a mirror and the sky     dazzling with light   in the afternoon we passed a ship     in full sail  near enough to exchange salutes and cheers      after tossing about for six days without seeing a human     being  except those on our vessel  even this was a sensation      then an hour or two before sunset came the great sensation     of  land   at first  nothing but a shadow on the far horizon      like the ghost of a ship  two or three widely scattered rocks     which were the promontories of ireland  and sooner than we     expected we were steaming along low lying purple hills     the journey to chester gives her  the first glimpse of mellow england    a surprise which is yet no surprise  so well known and familiar does it appear   then chester  with its quaint  picturesque streets   like the scene of a walter scott novel  the cathedral planted in greenness  and the clear  gray river where a boatful of scarlet dragoons goes gliding by    everything is a picture for her special benefit   she  drinks in  at every sense  the sights  sounds  and smells  and the unimaginable beauty of it all    then the bewilderment of london  and a whirl of people  sights  and impressions  she was received with great distinction by the jews  and many of the leading men among them warmly advocated her views   but it was not alone from her own people that she met with exceptional consideration  she had the privilege of seeing many of the most eminent personages of the day  all of whom honored her with special and personal regard  there was  no doubt  something that strongly attracted people to her at this time   the force of her intellect at once made itself felt  while at the same time the unaltered simplicity and modesty of her character  and her readiness and freshness of enthusiasm  kept her still almost like a child   she makes a flying visit to paris  where she happens to be on the 14th of july  the anniversary of the storming of the bastile  and of the beginning of the republic  she drives to versailles   that gorgeous shell of royalty  where the crowd who celebrate the birth of the republic wander freely through the halls and avenues  and into the most sacred rooms of the king        there are ruins on every side in paris   she says   ruins of the commune  or the siege  or the revolution  it is terrible  it seems as if the city were seared with fire and blood    such was paris to her then  and she hastens back to her beloved london  starting from there on the tour through england that has been mapped out for her    a day in surrey with william morris   published in  the century magazine   describes her visit to merton abbey  the old  norman monastery  converted into a model factory by the poet  humanitarian  who himself received her as his guest  conducted her all over the picturesque building and garden  and explained to her his views of art and his aims for the people   she drives through kent   where the fields  valleys  and slopes are garlanded with hops and ablaze with scarlet poppies    then canterbury  windsor  and oxford  stratford  warwick  the valley of the wye  wells  exeter  and salisbury   cathedral after cathedral   back to london  and then north through york  durham  and edinburgh  and on the 15th of september she sails for home   we have merely named the names  for it is impossible to convey an idea of the delight and importance of this trip   a crescendo of enjoyment   as she herself calls it  long after  in strange  dark hours of suffering  these pictures of travel arose before her  vivid and tragic even in their hold and spell upon her   the winter of 1883 84 was not especially productive   she wrote a few reminiscences of her journey and occasional poems on the jewish themes  which appeared in the  american hebrew   but for the most part gave herself up to quiet retrospect and enjoyment with her friends of the life she had had a glimpse of  and the experience she had stored   a restful  happy period   in august of the same year she was stricken with a severe and dangerous malady  from which she slowly recovered  only to go through a terrible ordeal and affliction  her father s health  which had long been failing  now broke down completely  and the whole winter was one long strain of acute anxiety  which culminated in his death  in march  1885   the blow was a crushing one for emma   truly  the silver cord was loosed  and the golden bowl broken   life lost its meaning and charm   her father s sympathy and pride in her work had been her chief incentive and ambition  and had spurred her on when her own confidence and spirit failed   never afterwards did she find complete and spontaneous expression   she decided to go abroad as the best means of regaining composure and strength and sailed once more in may for england  where she was welcomed now by the friends she had made  almost as to another home   she spent the summer very quietly at richmond an ideally beautiful spot in yorkshire  where she soon felt the beneficial influence of her peaceful surroundings    the very air seems to rest one here   she writes  and inspired by the romantic loveliness of the place  she even composed the first few chapters of a novel  begun with a good deal of dash and vigor  but soon abandoned  for she was still struggling with depression and gloom    i have neither ability  energy  nor purpose   she writes    it is impossible to do anything  so i am forced to set it aside for the present  whether to take it up again or not in the future remains to be seen    in the autumn she goes on the continent  visiting the hague  which  completely fascinates  her  and where she feels  stronger and more cheerful  than she has  for many a day    then paris  which this time amazes her  with its splendor and magnificence   all the ghosts of the revolution are somehow laid   she writes  and she spends six weeks here enjoying to the full the gorgeous autumn weather  the sights  the picture galleries  the bookshops  the whole brilliant panorama of the life  and early in december she starts for italy   and now once more we come upon that keen zest of enjoyment  that pure desire and delight of the eyes  which are the prerogative of the poet   emma lazarus was a poet   the beauty of the world   what a rapture and intoxication it is  and how it bursts upon her in the very land of beauty   where dante and petrarch trod    a magic glow colours it all  no mere blues and greens anymore  but a splendor of purple and scarlet and emerald   each tower  castle  and village shining like a jewel  the olive  the fig  and at your feet the roses  growing in mid december    a day in pisa seems like a week  so crowded is it with sensations and unforgettable pictures   then a month in florence  which is still more entrancing with its inexhaustible treasures of beauty and art  and finally rome  the climax of it all           wiping out all other places and impressions  and opening     a whole new world of sensations   i am wild with the     excitement of this tremendous place   i have been here a     week  and have seen the vatican and the capitoline museums      and the sistine chapel  and st  peter s  besides the ruins     on the streets and on the hills  and the graves of shelley     and keats        it is all heart breaking   i don t only mean those beautiful     graves  overgrown with acanthus and violets  but the mutilated     arches and columns and dumb appealing fragments looming up in     the glowing sunshine under the roman blue sky     true to her old attractions  it is pagan rome that appeals to her most strongly           and the far away past  that seems so sad and strange and     near   i am even out of humor with pictures  a bit of broken     stone or a  fragment of a bas relief  or a corinthian column     standing out against this lapis lazuli sky  or a tremendous     arch  are the only things i can look at for the moment        except the sistine chapel  which is as gigantic as the rest      and forces itself upon you with equal might     already  in february  spring is in the air   the almond trees are in bloom  violets cover the grass  and oh  the divine  the celestial  the unheard of beauty of it all    it is almost a pang for her   with its strange mixture of longing and regret and delight   and in the midst of it she says   i have to exert all my strength not to lose myself in morbidness and depression    early in march she leaves rome  consoled with the thought of returning the following winter   in june she was in england again  and spent the summer at malvern   disease was no doubt already beginning to prey upon her  for she was oppressed at times by a languor and heaviness amounting almost to lethargy   when she returned to london  however  in september  she felt quite well again  and started for another tour in holland  which she enjoyed as much as before   she then settled in paris  to await the time when she could return to italy   but she was attacked at once with grave and alarming symptoms  that betokened a fatal end to her malady   entirely ignorant  however  of the danger that threatened her  she kept up courage and hope  made plans for the journey  and looked forward to setting out at any moment   but the weeks passed and the months also  slowly and gradually the hope faded   the journey to italy must be given up  she was not in condition to be brought home  and she reluctantly resigned herself to remain where she was and  convalesce   as she confidently believed  in the spring   once again came the analogy  which she herself pointed out now  to heine on his mattress grave in paris   she  too  the last time she went out  dragged herself to the louvre  to the feet of the venus   the goddess without arms  who could not help    only her indomitable will and intense desire to live seemed to keep her alive   she sunk to a very low ebb  but  as she herself expressed it  she  seemed to have always one little window looking out into life   and in the spring she rallied sufficiently to take a few drives and to sit on the balcony of her apartment   she came back to life with a feverish sort of thirst and avidity    no such cure for pessimism   she says   as a severe illness  the simplest pleasures are enough   to breathe the air and see the sun    many plans were made for leaving paris  but it was finally decided to risk the ocean voyage and bring her home  and accordingly she sailed july 23rd  arriving in new york on the last day of that month   she did not rally after this  and now began her long agony  full of every kind of suffering  mental and physical   only her intellect seemed kindled anew  and none but those who saw her during the last supreme ordeal can realize that wonderful flash and fire of the spirit before its extinction   never did she appear so brilliant  wasted to a shadow  and between acute attacks of pain  she talked about art  poetry  the scenes of travel  of which her brain was so full  and the phases of her own condition  with an eloquence for which even those who knew her best were quite unprepared   every faculty seemed sharpened and every sense quickened as the  strong deliveress  approached  and the ardent soul was released from the frame that could no longer contain it   we cannot restrain a feeling of suddenness and incompleteness and a natural pang of wonder and regret for a life so richly and so vitally endowed thus cut off in its prime   but for us it is not fitting to question or repine  but rather to rejoice in the rare possession that we hold   what is any life  even the most rounded and complete  but a fragment and a hint   what emma lazarus might have accomplished  had she been spared  it is idle and even ungrateful to speculate   what she did accomplish has real and peculiar significance   it is the privilege of a favored few that every fact and circumstance of their individuality shall add lustre and value to what they achieve   to be born a jewess was a distinction for emma lazarus  and she in turn conferred distinction upon her race   to be born a woman also lends a grace and a subtle magnetism to her influence   nowhere is there contradiction or incongruity  her works bear the imprint of her character  and her character of her works  the same directness and honesty  the same limpid purity of tone  and the same atmosphere of things refined and beautiful  the vulgar  the false  and the ignoble   she scarcely comprehended them  while on every side she was open and ready to take in and respond to whatever can adorn and enrich life   literature was no mere  profession  for her  which shut out other possibilities  it was only a free  wide horizon and background for culture   she was passionately devoted to music  which inspired some of her best poems  and during the last years of her life  in hours of intense physical suffering  she found relief and consolation in listening to the strains of bach and beethoven   when she went abroad  painting was revealed to her  and she threw herself with the same ardor and enthusiasm into the study of the great masters  her last work  left unfinished  was a critical analysis of the genius and personality of rembrandt   and now  at the end  we ask  has the grave really closed over all these gifts   has that eager  passionate striving ceased  and  is the rest silence    who knows   but would we break  if we could  that repose  that silence and mystery and peace everlasting                                epochs     the epochs of our life are not in the facts  but in the     silent thought by the wayside as we walk    emerson                    i  youth    sweet empty sky of june without a stain    faint  gray blue dewy mists on far off hills  warm  yellow sunlight flooding mead and plain    that each dark copse and hollow overfills    the rippling laugh of unseen  rain fed rills  weeds delicate flowered  white and pink and gold  a murmur and a singing manifold    the gray  austere old earth renews her youth   with dew lines  sunshine  gossamer  and haze  how still she lies and dreams  and veils the truth    while all is fresh as in the early days    what simple things be these the soul to raise to bounding joy  and make young pulses beat  with nameless pleasure finding life so sweet    on such a golden morning forth there floats    between the soft earth and the softer sky  in the warm air adust with glistening motes    the mystic winged and flickering butterfly    a human soul  that hovers giddily among the gardens of earth s paradise  nor dreams of fairer fields or loftier skies                     ii  regret    thin summer rain on grass and bush and hedge    reddening the road and deepening the green on wide  blurred lawn  and in close tangled sedge    veiling in gray the landscape stretched between   these low broad meadows and the pale hills seen but dimly on the far horizon s edge    in these transparent clouded  gentle skies    wherethrough the moist beams of the soft june sun might any moment break  no sorrow lies    no note of grief in swollen brooks that run    no hint of woe in this subdued  calm tone of all the prospect unto dreamy eyes    only a tender  unnamed half regret   for the lost beauty of the gracious morn  a yearning aspiration  fainter yet    for brighter suns in joyous days unborn    now while brief showers ruffle grass and corn  and all the earth lies shadowed  grave  and wet    space for the happy soul to pause again   from pure content of all unbroken bliss  to dream the future void of grief and pain    and muse upon the past  in reveries   more sweet for knowledge that the present is not all complete  with mist and clouds and rain                     iii  longing    look westward o er the steaming rain washed slopes    now satisfied with sunshine  and behold those lustrous clouds  as glorious as our hopes    softened with feathery fleece of downy gold    in all fantastic  huddled shapes uprolled  floating like dreams  and melting silently  in the blue upper regions of pure sky    the eye is filled with beauty  and the heart   rejoiced with sense of life and peace renewed  and yet at such an hour as this  upstart   vague myriad longing  restless  unsubdued    and causeless tears from melancholy mood  strange discontent with earth s and nature s best  desires and yearnings that may find no rest                     iv  storm    serene was morning with clear  winnowed air    but threatening soon the low  blue mass of cloud rose in the west  with mutterings faint and rare   at first  but waxing frequent and more loud    thick sultry mists the distant hill tops shroud  the sunshine dies  athwart black skies of lead flash noiselessly thin threads of lightning red    breathless the earth seems waiting some wild blow    dreaded  but far too close to ward or shun  scared birds aloft fly aimless  and below   naught stirs in fields whence light and life are gone    save floating leaves  with wisps of straw and down  upon the heavy air   neath blue black skies  livid and yellow the green landscape lies    and all the while the dreadful thunder breaks    within the hollow circle of the hills  with gathering might  that angry echoes wakes    and earth and heaven with unused clamor fills    o erhead still flame those strange electric thrills  a moment more   behold  yon bolt struck home  and over ruined fields the storm hath come                     v  surprise    when the stunned soul can first lift tired eyes   on her changed world of ruin  waste and wrack  ah  what a pang of aching sharp surprise   brings all sweet memories of the lost past back  with wild self pitying grief of one betrayed  duped in a land of dreams where truth is dead    are these the heavens that she deemed were kind    is this the world that yesterday was fair  what painted images of folk half blind   be these who pass her by  as vague as air  what go they seeking  there is naught to find  let them come nigh and hearken her despair    a mocking lie is all she once believed    and where her heart throbbed  is a cold dead stone  this is a doom we never preconceived    yet now she cannot fancy it undone  part of herself  part of the whole hard scheme  all else is but the shadow of a dream                     vi  grief    there is a hungry longing in the soul    a craving sense of emptiness and pain  she may not satisfy nor yet control    for all the teeming world looks void and vain  no compensation in eternal spheres  she knows the loneliness of all her years    there is no comfort looking forth nor back    the present gives the lie to all her past  will cruel time restore what she doth lack    why was no shadow of this doom forecast  ah  she hath played with many a keen edged thing  naught is too small and soft to turn and sting    in the unnatural glory of the hour    exalted over time  and death  and fate  no earthly task appears beyond her power    no possible endurance seemeth great  she knows her misery and her majesty  and recks not if she be to live or die                     vii  acceptance    yea  she hath looked truth grimly face to face    and drained unto the lees the proffered cup  this silence is not patience  nor the grace   of recognition  meekly offered up  but mere acceptance fraught with keenest pain  seeing that all her struggles must be vain    her future clear and terrible outlies      this burden to be borne through all her days  this crown of thorns pressed down above her eyes    this weight of trouble she may never raise  no reconcilement doth she ask nor wait  knowing such things are  she endures her fate    no brave endeavor of the broken will   to cling to such poor stays as will abide  although the waves be wild and angry still    after the lapsing of the swollen tide  no fear of further loss  no hope of gain  naught but the apathy of weary pain                     viii  loneliness    all stupor of surprise hath passed away    she sees  with clearer vision than before  a world far off of light and laughter gay    herself alone and lonely evermore  folk come and go  and reach her in no wise  mere flitting phantoms to her heavy eyes    all outward things  that once seemed part of her    fall from her  like the leaves in autumn shed  she feels as one embalmed in spice and myrrh    with the heart eaten out  a long time dead  unchanged without  the features and the form  within  devoured by the thin red worm    by her own prowess she must stand or fall    this grief is to be conquered day by day  who could befriend her  who could make this small    or her strength great  she meets it as she may  a weary struggle and a constant pain  she dreams not they may ever cease nor wane                     ix  sympathy    it comes not in such wise as she had deemed    else might she still have clung to her despair  more tender  grateful than she could have dreamed    fond hands passed pitying over brows and hair    and gentle words borne softly through the air  calming her weary sense and wildered mind  by welcome  dear communion with her kind    ah  she forswore all words as empty lies    what speech could help  encourage  or repair  yet when she meets these grave  indulgent eyes    fulfilled with pity  simplest words are fair    caressing  meaningless  that do not dare to compensate or mend  but merely soothe with hopeful visions after bitter truth    one who through conquered trouble had grown wise    to read the grief unspoken  unexpressed   the misery of the blank and heavy eyes      or through youth s infinite compassion guessed   the heavy burden   such a one brought rest  and bade her lay aside her doubts and fears  while the hard pain dissolved in blessed tears                     x  patience    the passion of despair is quelled at last    the cruel sense of undeserved wrong  the wild self pity  these are also past    she knows not what may come  but she is strong  she feels she hath not aught to lose nor gain  her patience is the essence of all pain    as one who sits beside a lapsing stream    she sees the flow of changeless day by day  too sick and tired to think  too sad to dream    nor cares how soon the waters slip away  nor where they lead  at the wise god s decree  she will depart or bide indifferently    there is deeper pathos in the mild   and settled sorrow of the quiet eyes  than in the tumults of the anguish wild    that made her curse all things beneath the skies  no question  no reproaches  no complaint  hers is the holy calm of some meek saint                     xi  hope    her languid pulses thrill with sudden hope    that will not be forgot nor cast aside  and life in statelier vistas seems to ope    illimitably lofty  long  and wide  what doth she know   she is subdued and mild  quiet and docile  as a weaned child     if grief came in such unimagined wise    how may joy dawn   in what undreamed of hour  may the light break with splendor of surprise    disclosing all the mercy and the power  a baseless hope  yet vivid  keen  and bright  as the wild lightning in the starless night    she knows not whence it came  nor where it passed    but it revealed  in one brief flash of flame  a heaven so high  a world so rich and vast    that  full of meek contrition and mute shame  in patient silence hopefully withdrawn  she bows her head  and bides the certain dawn                     xii  compensation     t is not alone that black and yawning void   that makes her heart ache with this hungry pain  but the glad sense of life hath been destroyed    the lost delight may never come again  yet myriad serious blessings with grave grace arise on every side to fill their place    for much abides in her so lonely life      the dear companionship of her own kind  love where least looked for  quiet after strife    whispers of promise upon every wind  a quickened insight  in awakened eyes  for the new meaning of the earth and skies    the nameless charm about all things hath died    subtle as aureole round a shadow s head  cast on the dewy grass at morning tide    yet though the glory and the joy be fled   t is much her own endurance to have weighed  and wrestled with god s angels  unafraid                     xiii  faith    she feels outwearied  as though o er her head   a storm of mighty billows broke and passed  whose hand upheld her   who her footsteps led   to this green haven of sweet rest at last  what strength was hers  unreckoned and unknown  what love sustained when she was most alone    unutterably pathetic her desire    to reach  with groping arms outstretched in prayer  something to cling to  to uplift her higher   from this low world of coward fear and care  above disaster  that her will may be at one with god s  accepting his decree    though by no reasons she be justified    yet strangely brave in evil s very face  she deems this want must needs be satisfied    though here all slips from out her weak embrace  and in blind ecstasy of perfect faith  with her own dream her prayer she answereth                     xiv  work    yet life is not a vision nor a prayer    but stubborn work  she may not shun her task  after the first compassion  none will spare   her portion and her work achieved  to ask  she pleads for respite   she will come ere long when  resting by the roadside  she is strong    nay  for the hurrying throng of passers by   will crush her with their onward rolling stream  much must be done before the brief light die    she may not loiter  rapt in the vain dream  with unused trembling hands  and faltering feet  she staggers forth  her lot assigned to meet    but when she fills her days with duties done    strange vigor comes  she is restored to health  new aims  new interests rise with each new sun    and life still holds for her unbounded wealth  all that seemed hard and toilsome now proves small  and naught may daunt her   she hath strength for all                     xv  victory    how strange  in some brief interval of rest    backward to look on her far stretching past  to see how much is conquered and repressed    how much is gained in victory at last  the shadow is not lifted   but her faith  strong from life s miracles  now turns toward death    though much be dark where once rare splendor shone    yet the new light has touched high peaks unguessed in her gold  mist bathed dawn  and one by one   new outlooks loom from many a mountain crest  she breathes a loftier  purer atmosphere  and life s entangled paths grow straight and clear    nor will death prove an all unwelcome guest    the struggle has been toilsome to this end  sleep will be sweet  and after labor rest    and all will be atoned with him to friend  much must be reconciled  much justified  and yet she feels she will be satisfied                     xvi  peace    the calm outgoing of a long  rich day    checkered with storm and sunshine  gloom and light  now passing in pure  cloudless skies away    withdrawing into silence of blank night    thick shadows settle on the landscape bright  like the weird cloud of death that falls apace on the still features of the passive face    soothing and gentle as a mother s kiss    the touch that stopped the beating of the heart  a look so blissfully serene as this    not all the joy of living could impart  with dauntless faith and courage therewithal  the master found her ready at his call    on such a golden evening forth there floats    between the grave earth and the glowing sky in the clear air  unvexed with hazy motes    the mystic winged and flickering butterfly    a human soul  that drifts at liberty  ah  who can tell to what strange paradise  to what undreamed of fields and lofty skies                        how long      how long  and yet how long  our leaders will we hail from over seas  master and kings from feudal monarchies    and mock their ancient song with echoes weak of foreign melodies      that distant isle mist wreathed  mantled in unimaginable green  too long hath been our mistress and our queen    our fathers have bequeathed too deep a love for her  our hearts within      she made the whole world ring with the brave exploits of her children strong  and with the matchless music of her song    too late  too late we cling to alien legends  and their strains prolong      this fresh young world i see  with heroes  cities  legends of her own  with a new race of men  and overblown   by winds from sea to sea  decked with the majesty of every zone      i see the glittering tops of snow peaked mounts  the wid ning vale s expanse  large prairies where free herds of horses prance    exhaustless wealth of crops  in vast  magnificent extravagance      these grand  exuberant plains  these stately rivers  each with many a mouth  the exquisite beauty of the soft aired south    the boundless seas of grains  luxuriant forests  lush and splendid growth      the distant siren song of the green island in the eastern sea  is not the lay for this new chivalry    it is not free and strong to chant on prairies  neath this brilliant sky      the echo faints and fails  it suiteth not  upon this western plain  out voice or spirit  we should stir again   the wilderness  and make the vales resound unto a yet unheard of strain                       heroes      in rich virginian woods  the scarlet creeper reddens over graves  among the solemn trees enlooped with vines  heroic spirits haunt the solitudes    the noble souls of half a million braves    amid the murmurous pines      ah  who is left behind  earnest and eloquent  sincere and strong  to consecrate their memories with words not all unmeet  with fitting dirge and song to chant a requiem purer than the wind    and sweeter than the birds      here  though all seems at peace  the placid  measureless sky serenely fair  the laughter of the breeze among the leaves  the bars of sunlight slanting through the trees  the reckless wild flowers blooming everywhere    the grasses  delicate sheaves        nathless each breeze that blows  each tree that trembles to its leafy head with nervous life  revives within our mind  tender as flowers of may  the thoughts of those who lie beneath the living beauty  dead      beneath the sunshine  blind      for brave dead soldiers  these  blessings and tears of aching thankfulness  soft flowers for the graves in wreaths enwove  the odorous lilac of dear memories  the heroic blossoms of the wilderness    and the rich rose of love      but who has sung their praise  not less illustrious  who are living yet  armies of heroes  satisfied to pass calmly  serenely from the whole world s gaze  and cheerfully accept  without regret    their old life as it was      with all its petty pain  its irritating littleness and care  they who have scaled the mountain  with content sublime  descend to live upon the plain  steadfast as though they breathed the mountain air   still  wheresoe er they went     they who were brave to act  and rich enough their action to forget  who  having filled their day with chivalry  withdraw and keep their simpleness intact  and all unconscious add more lustre yet   unto their victory      on the broad western plains their patriarchal life they live anew  hunters as mighty as the men of old  or harvesting the plenteous  yellow grains  gathering ripe vintage of dusk bunches blue  or working mines of gold      or toiling in the town  armed against hindrance  weariness  defeat  with dauntless purpose not to serve or yield  and calm  defiant  they struggle on  as sturdy and as valiant in the street    as in the camp and field      and those condemned to live  maimed  helpless  lingering still through suffering years  may they not envy now the restful sleep of the dear fellow martyrs they survive  not o er the dead  but over these  your tears    o brothers  ye may weep      new england fields i see  the lovely  cultured landscape  waving grain  wide haughty rivers  and pale  english skies  and lo  a farmer ploughing busily  who lifts a swart face  looks upon the plain      i see  in his frank eyes      the hero s soul appear  thus in the common fields and streets they stand  the light that on the past and distant gleams  they cast upon the present and the near  with antique virtues from some mystic land    of knightly deeds and dreams                       admetus       to my friend  ralph waldo emerson      he who could beard the lion in his lair  to bind him for a girl  and tame the boar  and drive these beasts before his chariot  might wed alcestis   for her low brows  sake  her hairs  soft undulations of warm gold  her eyes clear color and pure virgin mouth  though many would draw bow or shiver spear  yet none dared meet the intolerable eye  or lipless tusk  of lion or boar  this heard admetus  king of thessaly  whose broad  fat pastures spread their ample fields down to the sheer edge of amphrysus  stream  who laughed  disdainful  at the father s pride  that set such value on one milk faced child      one morning  as he rode alone and passed through the green twilight of thessalian woods  between two pendulous branches interlocked  as through an open casement  he descried a goddess  as he deemed   in truth a maid  on a low bank she fondled tenderly a favorite hound  her floral face inclined above the glossy  graceful animal  that pressed his snout against her cheek and gazed wistfully  with his keen  sagacious eyes  one arm with lax embrace the neck enwreathed  with polished roundness near the sleek  gray skin  admetus  fixed with wonder dare not pass  intrusive on her holy innocence and sacred girlhood  but his fretful steed snuffed the air  and champed and pawed the ground  and hearing this  the maiden raised her head  no let or hindrance then might stop the king  once having looked upon those supreme eyes  the drooping boughs disparting  forth he sped  and then drew in his steed  to ask the path  like a lost traveller in an alien land  although each river cloven vale  with streams arrowy glancing to the blue aegean  each hallowed mountain  the abode of gods  pelion and ossa fringed with haunted groves  the height  spring crowned  of dedicate olympus  and pleasant sun fed vineyards  were to him familiar as his own face in the stream  nathless he paused and asked the maid what path might lead him from the forest   she replied  but still he tarried  and with sportsman s praise admired the hound and stooped to stroke its head  and asked her if she hunted   nay  not she  her father pelias hunted in these woods  where there was royal game   he knew her now    alcestis   and he left her with due thanks  no goddess  but a mortal  to be won by such a simple feat as driving boars and lions to his chariot   what was that to him who saw the boar of calydon  the sacred boar of artemis  at bay in the broad stagnant marsh  and sent his darts in its tough  quivering flank  and saw its death  stung by sure arrows of arcadian nymph      to river pastures of his flocks and herds admetus rode  where sweet breathed cattle grazed  heifers and goats and kids  and foolish sheep dotted cool  spacious meadows with bent heads  and necks  soft wool broken in yellow flakes  nibbling sharp toothed the rich  thick growing blades  one herdsman kept the innumerable droves   a boy yet  young as immortality   in listless posture on a vine grown rock  around him huddled kids and sheep that left the mother s udder for his nighest grass  which sprouted with fresh verdure where he sat  and yet dull neighboring rustics never guessed a god had been among them till he went  although with him they acted as he willed  renouncing shepherds  silly pranks and quips  because his very presence made them grave  amphryssius  after their translucent stream  they called him  but admetus knew his name    hyperion  god of sun and song and silver speech  condemned to serve a mortal for his sin to zeus in sending violent darts of death  a raising hand irreverent  against the one eyed forgers of the thunderbolt  for shepherd s crook he held the living rod of twisted serpents  later hermes  wand  him sought the king  discovering soon hard by  idle as one in nowise bound to time  watching the restless grasses blow and wave  the sparkle of the sun upon the stream  regretting nothing  living with the hour  for him  who had his light and song within  was naught that did not shine  and all things sang  admetus prayed for his celestial aid to win alcestis  which the god vouchsafed  granting with smiles  as grant all gods  who smite with stern hand  sparing not for piteousness  but give their gifts in gladness                                       thus the king led with loose rein the beasts as tame as kine  and townsfolk thronged within the city streets  as round a god  and mothers showed their babes  and maidens loved the crowned intrepid youth  and men aloud worship  though the very god who wrought the wonder dwelled unnoted nigh  divinely scornful of neglect or praise  then pelias  seeing this would be his son  as he had vowed  called for his wife and child  with anaxibia  alcestis came  a warm flush spreading o er her eager face in looking on the rider of the woods  and knowing him her suitor and the king      admetus won alcestis thus to wife  and these with mated hearts and mutual love lived a life blameless  beautiful  the king ordaining justice in the gates  the queen  with grateful offerings to the household gods  wise with the wisdom of the pure in heart  one child she bore   eumelus   and he throve  yet none the less because they sacrificed the firstlings of their flocks and fruits and flowers  did trouble come  for sickness seized the king  alcestis watched with many handed love  but unavailing service  for he lay with languid limbs  despite his ancient strength of sinew  and his skill with spear and sword  his mother came  clymene  and with her his father  pheres  his unconscious child they brought him  while forlorn alcestis sat discouraged  with the face of desolation  the jealous gods would bind his mouth from speech  and smite his vigorous frame with impotence  and ruin with bitter ashes  worms  and dust  the beauty of his crowned  exalted head  he knew her presence   soon he would not know  nor feel her hand in his lie warm and close  nor care if she were near him any more  exhausted with long vigils  thus the queen held hard and grievous thoughts  till heavy sleep possessed her weary sense  and she dreamed  and even in her dream her trouble lived  for she was praying in a barren field to all the gods for help  when came across the waste of air and land  from distant skies  a spiritual voice divinely clear  whose unimaginable sweetness thrilled her aching heart with tremor of strange joy   arise  alcestis  cast away white fear  a god dwells with you  seek  and you shall find   then quiet satisfaction filled her soul almost akin to gladness  and she woke  weak as the dead  admetus lay there still  but she  superb with confidence  arose  and passed beyond the mourners  curious eyes  seeking amphryssius in the meadow lands  she found him with the godlike mien of one who  roused  awakens unto deeds divine   i come  hyperion  with incessant tears  to crave the life of my dear lord the king  pity me  for i see the future years widowed and laden with disastrous days  and ye  the gods  will miss him when the fires upon your shrines  unfed  neglected die  who will pour large libations in your names  and sacrifice with generous piety  silence and apathy will greet you there where once a splendid spirit offered praise  grant me this boon divine  and i will beat with prayer at morning s gates  before they ope unto thy silver hoofed and flame eyed steeds  answer ere yet the irremeable stream be crossed  answer  o god  and save                                      she ceased  with full throat salt with tears  and looked on him  and with a sudden cry of awe fell prone  for  lo  he was transmuted to a god  the supreme aureole radiant round his brow  divine refulgences on his face   his eyes awful with splendor  and his august head with blinding brilliance crowned by vivid flame  then in a voice that charmed the listening air   woman  arise  i have no influence on death  who is the servant of the fates  howbeit for thy passion and thy prayer  the grace of thy fair womanhood and youth  thus godlike will i intercede for thee  and sue the insatiate sisters for this life  yet hope not blindly  loth are these to change their purpose  neither will they freely give  but haggling lend or sell  perchance the price will counterveil the boon   consider this  now rise and look upon me    and she rose  but by her stood no godhead bathed in light  but young amphryssius  herdsman to the king  benignly smiling                      fleet as thought  the god fled from the glittering earth to blackest depths of tartarus  and none might say he sped on wings ambrosial  or with feet as swift as scouring hail  or airy chariot borne by the flame breathing steeds ethereal  but with a motion inconceivable departed and was there   before the throne of ades  first he hailed the long sought queen  stolen with violent hands from grassy fields and delicate airs of sunlit sicily  pensive  gold haired  but innocent eyed no more as when she laughing plucked the daffodils  but grave as on fulfilling a strange doom  and low at ades  feet  wrapped in grim murk and darkness thick  the three gray women sat  loose robed and chapleted with wool and flowers  purple narcissi round their horrid hair  intent upon her task  the first one held the tender thread that at a touch would snap  the second weaving it with warp and woof into strange textures  some stained dark and foul  some sanguine colored  and some black as night  and rare ones white  or with a golden thread running throughout the web  the farthest hag with glistening scissors cut her sisters  work  to these hyperion  but they never ceased  nor raised their eyes  till with soft  moderate tones  but by their powerful persuasiveness commanding all to listen and obey  he spoke  and all hell heard  and these three looked and waited his request                               i come  a god  at pure mortal queen s request  who sues for life renewed unto her dying lord  admetus  and i also pray this prayer    then cease  for when hath fate been moved by prayer    but strength and upright heart should serve with you    i ask ye not forever to forbear  but spare a while   a moment unto us  a lifetime unto men     the fates swerve not for supplications  like the pliant gods  have they not willed a life s thread should be cut  with them the will is changeless as the deed  o men  ye have not learned in all the past  desires are barren and tears yield no fruit  how long will ye besiege the thrones of gods with lamentations   when lagged death for all your timorous shirking   we work not like you  delaying and relenting  purposeless  with unenduring issues  but our deeds  forever interchained and interlocked  complete each other and explain themselves    ye will a life  then why not any life    what care we for the king   he is not worth these many words  indeed  we love not speech  we care not if he live  or lose such life as men are greedy for   filled full with hate  sins beneath scorn  and only lit by dreams  or one sane moment  or a useless hope    lasting how long   the space between the green and fading yellow of the grass they tread   but he withdrawing not   will any life suffice ye for admetus     yea   the crones three times repeated    we know no such names as king or queen or slave  we want but life  begone  and vex us in our work no more       with broken blessings  inarticulate joy and tears  alcestis thanked hyperion  and worshipped   then he gently   who will die  so that the king may live    and she   you ask  nay  who will live when life clasps hands with shame  and death with honor   lo  you are a god  you cannot know the highest joy of life    to leave it when  t is worthier to die  his parents  kinsmen  courtiers  subjects  slaves    for love of him myself would die  were none found ready  but what greek would stand to see a woman glorified  and falter   once  and only once  the gods will do this thing in all the ages  such a man themselves delight to honor   holy  temperate  chaste  with reverence for his daemon and his god   thus she triumphant to they very door of king admetus  chamber   all there saw her ill timed gladness with much wonderment  but she   no longer mourn   the king is saved  the fates will spare him   lift your voice in praise  sing paeans to apollo  crown your brows with laurel  offer thankful sacrifice    o queen  what mean these foolish words misplaced  and what an hour is this to thank the fates    thrice blessed be the gods   for god himself has sued for me   they are not stern and deaf  cry  and they answer  commune with your soul  and they send counsel  weep with rainy grief  and these will sweeten you your bitterest tears  on one condition king admetus lives  and ye  on hearing  will lament no more  each emulous to save    then  for she spake assured  as having heard an oracle   they asked   what deed of ours may serve the king    the fates accept another life for his  and one of you may die    smiling  she ceased  but silence answered her    what  do ye thrust your arrows in your hearts beneath your cloaks  dying like greeks  too proud to own the pang  this ask i not   in all the populous land but one need suffer for immortal praise  the generous fates have sent no pestilence  famine  nor war  it is as though they gave freely  and only make the boon more rich by such slight payment   now a people mourns  and ye may change the grief to jubilee  filling the cities with a pleasant sound  but as for me  what faltering words can tell my joy  in extreme sharpness kin to pain  a monument you have within my heart  wreathed with kind love and dear remembrances  and i will pray for you before i crave pardon and pity for myself from god  your name will be the highest in the land  oftenest  fondest on my grateful lips  after the name of him you die to save  what  silent still   since when has virtue grown less beautiful than indolence and ease  is death more terrible  more hateworthy  more bitter than dishonor   will ye live on shame   chew and find sweet its poisoned fruits  what sons will ye bring forth  mean souled like you  or  like your parents  brave  to blush like girls  and say  our fathers were afraid to die   ye will not dare to raise heroic eyes unto the eyes of aliens   in the streets will women and young children point at you scornfully  and the sun will find you shamed  and night refuse to shield you   what a life is this ye spin and fashion for yourselves  and what new tortures of suspense and doubt will death invent for such as are afraid  acastus  thou my brother  in the field foremost  who greeted me with sanguine hands from ruddy battle with a conqueror s face    these honors wilt thou blot with infamy  nay  thou hast won no honors  a mere girl would do as much as thou at such a time  in clamorous battle  midst tumultuous sounds  neighing of war steeds  shouts of sharp command  snapping of shivered spears  for all are brave when all men look to them expectantly  but he is truly brave who faces death within his chamber  at a sudden call  at night  when no man sees   content to die when life can serve no longer those he loves   then thus acastus   sister  i fear not death  nor the empty darkness of the grave  and hold my life but as a little thing  subject unto my people s call  and fate  but if  t is little  no greater is the king s  and though my heart bleeds sorely  i recall astydamia  who thus would mourn for me  we are not cowards  we youth of thessaly  and thessaly  yea  all greece  knoweth it  nor will we brook the name from even you  albeit a queen  and uttering these wild words through your umwonted sorrow    then she knew that he stood firm  and turning from him  cried to the king s parents   are ye deaf with grief  pheres  clymene   ye can save your son  yet rather stand and weep with barren tears  o  shame  to think that such gray  reverend hairs should cover such unvenerable heads  what would ye lose   a remnant of mere life  a few slight raveled threads  and give him years to fill with glory   who  when he is gone  will call you gentlest names this side of heaven    father and mother   knew ye not this man ere he was royal   a poor  helpless child  crownless and kingdomless   one birth alone sufficeth not  clymene  once again you must give life with travail and strong pain  has he not lived to outstrip your swift hopes  what mother can refuse a second birth to such a son   but ye denying him  what after offering may appease the gods  what joy outweigh the grief of this one day  what clamor drown the hours  myriad tongues  crying   your son  your son  where is your son  unnatural mother  timid foolish man   then pheres gravely   these are graceless words from you our daughter   life is always life  and death comes soon enough to such as we  we twain are old and weak  have served our time  and made our sacrifices   let the young arise now in their turn and save the king    o gods  look on your creatures  do ye see  and seeing  have ye patience   smite them all  unsparing  with dishonorable death  vile slaves  a woman teaches you to die  intrepid  with exalted steadfast soul  scorn in my heart  and love unutterable  i yield the fates my life  and like a god command them to revere that sacred head  thus kiss i thrice the dear  blind  holy eyes  and bid them see  and thrice i kiss this brow  and thus unfasten i the pale  proud lips with fruitful kissings  bringing love and life  and without fear or any pang  i breathe my soul in him                         alcestis  i awake  i hear  i hear  unspeak thy reckless words  for  lo  thy life blood tingles in my veins  and streameth through my body like new wine  behold  thy spirit dedicate revives my pulse  and through thy sacrifice i breathe  thy lips are bloodless  kiss me not again  ashen thy cheeks  faded thy flower like hands  o woman  perfect in thy womanhood and in thy wifehood  i adjure thee now as mother  by the love thou bearest our child  in this thy hour of passion and of love  of sacrifice and sorrow  to unsay thy words sublime     i die that thou mayest live    and deemest thou that i accept the boon  craven  like these my subjects   lo  my queen  is life itself a lovely thing   bare life  and empty breath a thing desirable  or is it rather happiness and love that make it precious to its inmost core  when these are lost  are there not swords in greece  and flame and poison  deadly waves and plagues  no man has ever lacked these things and gone unsatisfied   it is not these the gods refuse  nay  never clutch my sleeve and raise thy lip     not these i seek  but i will stab myself  poison my life and burn my flesh  with words  and save or follow thee   lo  hearken now  i bid the gods take back their loathsome gifts  o spurn them  and i scorn them  and i hate  will they prove deaf to this as to my prayers  with tongue reviling  blasphemous  i curse  with mouth polluted from deliberate heart  dishonored be their names  scorned be their priests  ruined their altars  mocked their oracles  it is admetus  king of thessaly  defaming thus  annihilate him  gods  so that his queen  who worships you  may live   he paused as one expectant  but no bolt from the insulted heavens answered him  but awful silence followed   then a hand  a boyish hand  upon his shoulder fell  and turning  he beheld his shepherd boy  not wrathful  but divinely pitiful  who spake in tender  thrilling tones   the gods cannot recall their gifts   blaspheme them not  bow down and worship rather   shall he curse who sees not  and who hears not   neither knows nor understands   nay  thou shalt bless and pray    pray  for the pure heart purged by prayer  divines and seeth when the bolder eyes are blind  worship and wonder   these befit a man at every hour  and mayhap will the gods yet work a miracle for knees that bend and hands that supplicate                                 then all they knew a sudden sense of awe  and bowed their heads beneath the stripling s gaze  admetus fell  crushed by that gentle touch  and cried aloud   pardon and pity  i am hard beset                                              there waited at the doorway of the king one grim and ghastly  shadowy  horrible  bearing the likeness of a king himself  erect as one who serveth not   upon his head a crown  within his fleshless hands a sceptre   monstrous  winged  intolerable  to him a stranger coming  neath the trees  which slid down flakes of light  now on his hair  close curled  now on his bared and brawny chest  now on his flexile  vine like veined limbs  with iron network of strong muscle thewed  and godlike brows and proud mouth unrelaxed  firm was his step  no superfluity of indolent flesh impeded this man s strength  slender and supple every perfect limb  beautiful with the glory of a man  no weapons bare he  neither shield  his hands folded upon his breast  his movements free of all incumbrance   when his mighty strides had brought him nigh the waiting one  he paused   whose palace this  and who art thou  grim shade    the palace of the king of thessaly  and my name is not strange unto thine ears  for who hath told men that i wait for them  the one sure thing on earth   yet all they know  unasking and yet answered   i am death  the only secret that the gods reveal  but who are thou who darest question me    alcides  and that thing i dare not do hath found no name   whom here awaitest thou    alcestis  queen of thessaly   a queen who wooed me as the bridegroom woos the bride  for her life sacrificed will save her lord admetus  as the fates decreed   i wait impatient  eager  and i enter soon  with darkening wing  invisible  a god  and kiss her lips  and kiss her throbbing heart  and then the tenderest hands can do no more than close her eyes and wipe her cold  white brow  inurn her ashes and strew flowers above    this woman is a god  a hero  death  in this her sacrifice i see a soul luminous  starry  earth can spare her not  it is not rich enough in purity to lose this paragon   save her  o death  thou surely art more gentle than the fates  yet these have spared her lord  and never meant that she should suffer  and that this their grace  beautiful  royal on one side  should turn sudden and show a fearful  fatal face    nay  have they not   o fond and foolish man  naught comes unlooked for  unforeseen by them  doubt when they favor thee  though thou mayest laugh when they have scourged thee with an iron scourge  behold  their smile is deadlier than their sting  and every boon of theirs is double faced  yea  i am gentler unto ye than these  i slay relentless  but when have i mocked with poisoned gifts  and generous hands that smite under the flowers  for my name is truth  were this fair queen more fair  more pure  more chaste  i would not spare her for your wildest prayer nor her best virtue   is the earth s mouth full  is the grave satisfied   discrown me then  for life is lord  and men may mock the gods with immortality     i sue no more  but i command thee spare this woman s life  or wrestle with alcides     wrestle with thee  thou puny boy    and death laughed loud  and swelled to monstrous bulk  fierce eyed  with outstretched wings  and lightnings round his brow  but grave and firm  strong as a tower  alcides waited him  and these began to wrestle  and a cloud impenetrable fell  and all was dark                                             farewell  admetus and my little son  eumelus   o these clinging baby hands  thy loss is bitter  for no chance  no fame  no wealth of love  can ever compensate for a dead mother   thou  o king  fulfill the double duty  love him with my love  and make him bold to wrestle  shiver spears  noble and manly  grecian to the bone  and tell him that his mother spake with gods  farewell  farewell   mine eyes are growing blind  the darkness gathers   o my heart  my heart   no sound made answer save the cries of grief from all the mourners  and the suppliance of strick n admetus   o have mercy  gods  o gods  have mercy  mercy upon us   then from the dying woman s couch again her voice was heard  but with strange sudden tones   lo  i awake  the light comes back to me  what miracle is this    and thunders shook the air  and clouds of mighty darkness fell  and the earth trembled  and weird  horrid sounds were heard of rushing wings and fleeing feet  and groans  and all were silent  dumb with awe  saving the king  who paused not in his prayer   have mercy  gods   and then again   o gods  have mercy                   through the open casement poured bright floods of sunny light  the air was soft  clear  delicate as though a summer storm had passed away  and those there standing saw  afar upon the plain  death fleeing thence  and at the doorway  weary  well nigh spent  alcides  flushed with victory                       tannhauser            to my mother   may  1870    the landgrave hermann held a gathering of minstrels  minnesingers  troubadours  at wartburg in his palace  and the knight  sir tannhauser of france  the greatest bard  inspired with heavenly visions  and endowed with apprehension and rare utterance of noble music  fared in thoughtful wise across the horsel meadows   full of light  and large repose  the peaceful valley lay  in the late splendor of the afternoon  and level sunbeams lit the serious face of the young knight  who journeyed to the west  towards the precipitous and rugged cliffs  scarred  grim  and torn with savage rifts and chasms  that in the distance loomed as soft and fair and purple as their shadows on the grass  the tinkling chimes ran out athwart the air  proclaiming sunset  ushering evening in  although the sky yet glowed with yellow light  the ploughboy  ere he led his cattle home  in the near meadow  reverently knelt  and doffed his cap  and duly crossed his breast  whispering his  ave mary   as he heard the pealing vesper bell   but still the knight  unmindful of the sacred hour announced  disdainful or unconscious  held his course   would that i also  like yon stupid wight  could kneel and hail the virgin and believe   he murmured bitterly beneath his breath   were i a pagan  riding to contend for the olympic wreath  o with what zeal  what fire of inspiration  would i sing the praises of the gods   how may my lyre glorify these whose very life i doubt  the world is governed by one cruel god  who brings a sword  not peace   a pallid christ  unnatural  perfect  and a virgin cold  they give us for a heaven of living gods  beautiful  loving  whose mere names were song  a creed of suffering and despair  walled in on every side by brazen boundaries  that limit the soul s vision and her hope to a red hell or and unpeopled heaven  yea  i am lost already   even now am doomed to flaming torture for my thoughts  o gods  o gods  where shall my soul find peace   he raised his wan face to the faded skies  now shadowing into twilight  no response came from their sunless heights  no miracle  as in the ancient days of answering gods  with a long  shuddering sigh he glanced to earth  finding himself among the horsel cliffs  gray  sullen  gaunt  they towered on either side  scant shrubs sucked meagre life between the rifts of their huge crags  and made small darker spots upon their wrinkled sides  the jaded horse stumbled upon loose  rattling  fallen stones  amidst the gathering dusk  and blindly fared through the weird  perilous pass   as darkness waxed  and an oppressive mystery enwrapped the roadstead and the rocks  sir tannhauser fancied he saw upon the mountain side the fluttering of white raiment   with a sense of wild joy and horror  he gave pause  for his sagacious horse that reeked of sweat  trembling in every limb  confirmed his thought  that nothing human scaled that haunted cliff  the white thing seemed descending   now a cloud it looked  and now a rag of drifted mist  torn in the jagged gorge precipitous  and now an apparition clad in white  shapely and real   then he lost it quite  gazing on nothing with blank  foolish face  as with wide eyes he stood  he was aware of a strange splendor at his very side  a presence and a majesty so great  that ere he saw  he felt it was divine  he turned  and  leaping from his horse  fell prone  in speechless adoration  on the earth  before the matchless goddess  who appeared with no less freshness of immortal youth than when first risen from foam of paphian seas  he heard delicious strains of melody  such as his highest muse had ne er attained  float in the air  while in the distance rang  harsh and discordant  jarring with those tones  the gallop of his frightened horse s hoofs  clattering in sudden freedom down the pass  a voice that made all music dissonance then thrilled through heart and flesh of that prone knight  triumphantly   the gods need but appear  and their usurped thrones are theirs again   then tenderly   sweet knight  i pray thee  rise  worship me not  for i desire thy love  look on me  follow me  for i am fain of thy fair  human face    he rose and looked  stirred by that heavenly flattery to the soul  her hair  unbraided and unfilleted  rained in a glittering shower to the ground  and cast forth lustre   round her zone was clasped the scintillant cestus  stiff with flaming gold  thicker with restless gems than heaven with stars  she might have flung the enchanted wonder forth  her eyes  her slightest gesture would suffice to bind all men in blissful slavery  she sprang upon the mountain s dangerous side  with feet that left their print in flowers divine    flushed amaryllis and blue hyacinth  impurpled amaranth and asphodel  dewy with nectar  and exhaling scents richer than all the roses of mid june  the knight sped after her  with wild eyes fixed upon her brightness  as she lightly leapt from crag to crag  with flying auburn hair  like a gold cloud  that lured him ever on  higher and higher up the haunted cliff  at last amidst a grove of pines she paused  until he reached her  breathing hard with haste  delight  and wonder   then upon his hand she placed her own  and all his blood at once tingled and hotly rushed to brow and cheek  at the supreme caress  but the mere touch infused fresh life  and when she looked at him with gracious tenderness  he felt himself strong suddenly to bear the blinding light of those great eyes    dear knight   she murmured low   for love of me  wilt thou accord this boon    to grace my weary home in banishment   his hungry eyes gave answer ere he spoke  in tones abrupt that startled his own ears with their strange harshness  but with thanks profuse she guided him  still holding his cold hand in her warm  dainty palm  unto a cave  whence a rare glory issued  and a smell of spice and roses  frankincense and balm  they entering stood within a marble hall  with straight  slim pillars  at whose farther end the goddess led him to a spiral flight of stairs  descending always  midst black gloom into the very bowels of the earth  down these  with fearful swiftness  they made way  the knight s feet touching not the solid stair  but sliding down as in a vexing dream  blind  feeling but that hand divine that still empowered him to walk on empty air  then he was dazzled by a sudden blaze  in vast palace filled with reveling folk  cunningly pictured on the ivory walls were rolling hills  cool lakes  and boscage green  and all the summer landscape s various pomp  the precious canopy aloft was carved in semblance of the pleached forest trees  enameled with the liveliest green  wherethrough a light pierced  more resplendent than the day  o er the pale  polished jasper of the floor of burnished metal  fretted and embossed with all the marvelous story of her birth painted in prodigal splendor of rich tincts  and carved by heavenly artists   crystal seas  and long haired nereids in their pearly shells  and all the wonder of her lucent limbs sphered in a vermeil mist   upon the throne she took her seat  the knight beside her still  singing on couches of fresh asphodel  and the dance ceased  and the flushed revelers came in glittering phalanx to adore their queen  beautiful girls  with shining delicate heads  crested with living jewels  fanned the air with flickering wings from naked shoulders soft  then with preluding low  a thousand harps  and citherns  and strange nameless instruments  sent through the fragrant air sweet symphonies  and the winged dancers waved in mazy rounds  with changing lustres like a summer sea  fair boys  with charming yellow hair crisp curled  and frail  effeminate beauty  the knight saw  but of strong  stalwart men like him were none  he gazed thereon bewitched  until the hand of venus  erst withdrawn  now fell again upon his own  and roused him from his trance  he looked on her  and as he looked  a cloud auroral  flaming as at sunrising  arose from nothing  floating over them in luminous folds  like that vermilion mist penciled upon the throne  and as it waxed in density and brightness  all the throng of festal dancers  less and less distinct  grew like pale spirits in a vague  dim dream  and vanished altogether  and these twain  shut from the world in that ambrosial cloud  now with a glory inconceivable  vivid and conflagrant  looked each on each      all hours came laden with their own delights in that enchanted place  wherein time knew no divisions harsh of night and day  but light was always  and desire of sleep was satisfied at once with slumber soft  desire of food with magical repast  by unseen hands on golden tables spread  but these the knight accepted like a god  all less was lost in that excess of joy  the crowning marvel of her love for him  assuring him of his divinity  meanwhile remembrance of the earth appeared like the vague trouble of a transient dream    the doubt  the scruples  the remorse for thoughts beyond his own control  the constant thirst for something fairer than his life  more real than airy revelations of his muse  here was his soul s desire satisfied  all nobler passions died  his lyre he flung recklessly forth  with vows to dedicate his being to herself   she knew and seized the moment of her mastery  and conveyed the lyre beyond his sight and memory  with blandishment divine she changed for him  each hour  her mood  a very woman now  fantastic  voluble  affectionate  and jealous of the vague  unbodied air  exacting  penitent  and pacified  all in a breath   and often she appeared majestic with celestial wrath  with eyes that shot forth fire  and a heavy brow  portentous as the lowering front of heaven  when the reverberant  sullen thunder rolls among the echoing clouds   thus she denounced her ancient  fickle worshippers  who left her altars desecrate  her fires unfed  her name forgotten    but i reign  i reign   she would shrill forth  triumphant   yea  i reign  men name me not  but worship me unnamed  beauty and love within their heart of hearts  not with bent knees and empty breath of words  but with devoted sacrifice of lives   then melting in a moment  she would weep ambrosial tears  pathetic  full of guile  accusing her own base ingratitude  in craving worship  when she had his heart  her priceless knight  her peerless paladin  her tannhauser  then  with an artful glance of lovely helplessness  entreated him not to desert her  like the faithless world  for these unbeautiful and barbarous gods  or she would never cease her prayers to jove  until he took from her the heavy curse of immortality   with closer vows  the knight then sealed his worship and forswore all other aims and deeds to serve her cause  thus passed unnoted seven barren years of reckless passion and voluptuous sloth  undignified by any lofty thought in his degraded mind  that sometime was endowed with noble capability  from revelry to revelry he passed  craving more pungent pleasure momently  and new intoxications  and each hour the siren goddess answered his desires  once when she left him with a weary sense of utter lassitude  he sat alone  and  raising listless eyes  he saw himself in a great burnished mirror  wrought about with cunning imagery of twisted vines  he scarcely knew those sunken  red rimmed eyes  for his who in the flush of manhood rode among the cliffs  and followed up the crags the flying temptress  and there fell on him a horror of her beauty  a disgust for his degenerate and corrupted life  with irresistible  intense desire  to feel the breath of heaven on his face  then as fate willed  who rules above the gods  he saw  within the glass  behind him glide the form of venus   certain of her power  she had laid by  in fond security  the enchanted cestus  and sir tannhauser  with surfeited regard  beheld her now  no fairer than the women of the earth  whom with serenity and health he left  duped by a lovely witch   before he moved  she knew her destiny  and when he turned  he seemed to drop a mask  disclosing thus an alien face  and eyes with vision true  that for long time with glamour had been blind  hiding the hideous rage within her breast  with girlish simpleness of folded hands  auroral blushes  and sweet  shamefast mien  she spoke   behold  my love  i have cast forth all magic  blandishments and sorcery  for i have dreamed a dream so terrible  that i awoke to find my pillow stained with tears as of real woe   i thought my belt  by vulcan wrought with matchless skill and power  was the sole bond between us  this being doffed  i seemed to thee an old  unlovely crone  wrinkled by every year that i have seen  thou turnedst from me with a brutal sneer  so that i woke with weeping   then i rose  and drew the glittering girdle from my zone  jealous thereof  yet full of fears  and said   if it be this he loves  then let him go  i have no solace as a mortal hath  no hope of change or death to comfort me through all eternity  yet he is free  though i could hold him fast with heavy chains  bound in perpetual imprisonment   tell me my vision was a baseless dream  see  i am kneeling  and kiss thy hands    in pity  look on me  before thy word condemns me to immortal misery   as she looked down  the infernal influence worked on his soul again  for she was fair beyond imagination  and her brow seemed luminous with high self sacrifice  he bent and kissed her head  warm  shining  soft  with its close curling gold  and love revived   but ere he spoke  he heard the distant sound of one sweet  smitten lyre  and a gleam of violent anger flashed across the face upraised to his in feigned simplicity and singleness of purpose   then he sprang  well nigh a god himself  with sudden strength to vanquish and resist  beyond her reach  crying   my old muse calls me  and i hear  thy fateful vision is no baseless dream  i will be gone from this accursed hall   then she  too  rose  dilating over him  and sullen clouds veiled all her rosy limbs  unto her girdle  and her head appeared refulgent  and her voice rang wrathfully   have i cajoled and flattered thee till now  to lose thee thus   how wilt thou make escape  once being mine thou art forever mine  yea  not my love  but my poor slave and fool   but he  with both hands pressed upon his eyes  against that blinding lustre  heeded not her thundered words  and cried in sharp despair   help me  o virgin mary  and thereat  the very bases of the hall gave way  the roof was rived  the goddess disappeared  and tannhauser stood free upon the cliff  amidst the morning sunshine and fresh air      around him were the tumbled blocks and crags  huge ridges and sharp juts of flinty peaks  black caves  and masses of the grim  bald rock  the ethereal  unfathomable sky  hung over him  the valley lay beneath  dotted with yellow hayricks  that exhaled sweet  healthy odors to the mountain top  he breathed intoxicate the infinite air  and plucked the heather blossoms where they blew  reckless with light and dew  in crannies green  and scarcely saw their darling bells for tears  no sounds of labor reached him from the farms and hamlets trim  nor from the furrowed glebe  but a serene and sabbath stillness reigned  till broken by the faint  melodious chimes of the small village church that called to prayer  he hurried down the rugged  scarped cliff  and swung himself from shelving granite slopes to narrow foot holds  near wide throated chasms  tearing against the sharp stones his bleeding hands  with long hair flying from his dripping brow  uncovered head  and white  exalted face  no memory had he of his smooth ascent  no thought of fear upon those dreadful hills  he only heard the bell  inviting him to satisfy the craving of his heart  for worship  midst his fellow men   he reached the beaten  dusty road  and passed thereon the pious peasants faring towards the church  and scarce refrained from greeting them like friends dearly beloved  after long absence met  how more than fair the sunburnt wenches looked  in their rough  homespun gowns and coifs demure  after the beauty of bare  rosy limbs  and odorous  loose hair   he noted not suspicious glances on his garb uncouth  his air extravagant and face distraught  with bursts of laughter from the red cheeked boys  and prudent crossings of the women s breasts  he passed the flowering close about the church  and trod the well worn path  with throbbing heart  the little heather bell between his lips  and his eyes fastened on the good green grass  thus entered he the sanctuary  lit with frequent tapers  and with sunbeams stained through painted glass   how pure and innocent the waiting congregation seemed to him  kneeling  or seated with calm brows upraised  with faltering strength  he cowered down alone  and held sincere communion with the lord  for one brief moment  in a sudden gush of blessed tears   the minister of god rose to invoke a blessing on his flock  and then began the service   not in words to raise the lowly  and to heal the sick  but an alien tongue  with phrases formed  and meaningless observances   the knight  unmoved  yet thirsting for the simple word that might have moved him  held his bitter thoughts  but when in his own speech a new priest spake  looked up with hope revived  and heard the text   go  preach the gospel unto all the world  he that believes and is baptized  is saved  he that believeth not  is damned in hell   he sat with neck thrust forth and staring eyes  the crowded congregation disappeared  he felt alone in some black sea of hell  while a great light smote one exalted face  vivid already with prophetic fire  whose fatal mouth now thundered forth his doom  he longed in that void circle to cry out  with one clear shriek  but sense and voice seemed bound  and his parched tongue clave useless to his mouth  as the last words resounded through the church  and once again the pastor blessed his flock  who  serious and subdued  passed slowly down the arrow aisle  none noted  near the wall  a fallen man with face upon his knees  a heap of huddled garments and loose hair  unconscious  mid the rustling  murmurous stir   midst light and rural smell of grass and flowers  let in athwart the doorway   one lone priest  darkening the altar lights  moved noiselessly  now with the yellow glow upon his face  now a black shadow gliding farther on  amidst the smooth  slim pillars of hewn ash  but from the vacant aisles he heard at once a hollow sigh  heaved from a depth profound  upholding his last light above his head  and peering eagerly amidst the stalls  he cried   be blest who cometh in god s name   then the gaunt form of tannhauser arose   father  i am a sinner  and i seek forgiveness and help  by whatso means i can regain the joy of peace with god    the lord hath mercy on the penitent   although thy sins be scarlet   he hath said   will i not make them white as wool    confess  and i will shrive you    thus the good priest moved towards the remorseful knight and pressed his hand  but shrinking down  he drew his fingers back from the kind palm  and kissed the friar s feet   thy pure hand is anointed  and can heal  the cool  calm pressure brings back sanity  and what serene  past joys  yet touch me not  my contact is pollution   hear  o hear  while i disburden my charged soul    he lay  casting about for words and strength to speak   o father  is there help for such a one   in tones of deep abasement he began   who hath rebelled against the laws of god  with pride no less presumptuous than his who lost thereby his rank in heaven     my son  there is atonement for all sins   or slight or difficult  proportioned to the crime  though this may be the staining of thy hands with blood of kinsmen or of fellow men    my hands are white   my crime hath found no name  this side of hell  yet though my heart strings snap to live it over  let me make the attempt  i was a knight and bard  with such a gift of revelation that no hour of life lacked beauty and adornment  in myself the seat and centre of all happiness  what inspiration could my lofty muse draw from those common and familiar themes  painted upon the windows and the walls of every church   the mother and her child  the miracle and mystery of the birth  the death  the resurrection   fool and blind  that saw not symbols of eternal truth in that grand tragedy and victory  significant and infinite as life  what tortures did my skeptic soul endure  at war against herself and all mankind  the restless nights of feverish sleeplessness  with balancing of reasons nicely weighed  the dawn that brought no hope nor energy  the blasphemous arraignment of the lord  taxing his glorious divinity with all the grief and folly of the world  then came relapses into abject fear  and hollow prayer and praise from craven heart  before a sculptured venus i would kneel  crown her with flowers  worship her  and cry   o large and noble type of our ideal  at least my heart and prayer return to thee  amidst a faithless world of proselytes  madonna mary  with her virgin lips  and eyes that look perpetual reproach  insults and is a blasphemy on youth  is she to claim the worship of a man hot with the first rich flush of ripened life   realities  like phantoms  glided by  unnoted  midst the torment and delights of my conflicting spirit  and i doffed the modest christian weeds of charity and fit humility  and steeled myself in pagan panoply of stoicism and self sufficing pride   yet constantly i gained men s charmed attention and applause  with the wild strains i smote from out my lyre  to me the native language of my soul  to them attractive and miraculous  as all things whose solution and whose source remain a mystery   then came suddenly the summons to attend the gathering of minstrels at the landgrave hermann s court  resolved to publish there my pagan creed in harmonies so high and beautiful that all the world would share my zeal and faith  i journeyed towards the haunted horsel cliffs  o god  how may i tell you how she came  the temptress of a hundred centuries  yet fresh as april   she bewitched my sense  poisoned my judgment with sweet flatteries  and for i may not guess how many years held me a captive in degrading bonds  there is no sin of lust so lewd and foul  which i learned not in that alluring hell  until this morn  i snapped the ignoble tie  by calling on the mother of our lord  o for the power to stand again erect  and look men in the eyes   what penitence  what scourging of the flesh  what rigid fasts  what terrible privations may suffice to cleanse me in the sight of god and man   ill omened silence followed his appeal  patient and motionless he lay awhile  then sprang unto his feet with sudden force  confronting in his breathless vehemence  with palpitating heart  the timid priest   answer me  as you hope for a response  one day  at the great judgment seat yourself    i cannot answer   said the timid priest   i have not understood     just god  is this the curse thou layest upon me   i outstrip the sympathy and brotherhood of men  so far removed is my experience from their clean innocence   inspire me  prompt me to words that bring me near to them  father   in gentler accents he resumed   thank heaven at your every orison that sin like mine you cannot apprehend  more than the truth perchance i have confessed  but i have sinned  and darkly   this is true  and i have suffered  and am suffering now  is there no help in your great christian creed of liberal charity  for such a one    my son   the priest replied   your speech distraught hath quite bewildered me   i fain would hope that christ s large charity can reach your sin  but i know naught   i cannot but believe that the enchantress who first tempted you must be the evil one   your early doubt was the possession of your soul by him  travel across the mountain to the town  the first cathedral town upon the road that leads to rome   a sage and reverend priest  the bishop adrian  bides there   say you have come from his leal servant  friar lodovick  he hath vast lore and great authority  and may absolve you freely of your sin       over the rolling hills  through summer fields  by noisy villages and lonely lanes  through glowing days  when all the landscape stretched shimmering in the heat  a pilgrim fared towards the cathedral town   sir tannhauser had donned the mournful sackcloth  girt his loins with a coarse rope that ate into his flesh  muffled a cowl about his shaven head  hung a great leaden cross around his neck  and bearing in his hands a knotty staff  with swollen  sandaled feet he held his course  he snatched scant rest at twilight or at dawn  when his forced travel was least difficult  but most he journeyed when the sky  o ercast  uprolled its threatening clouds of dusky blue  and angry thunder grumbled through the hills  and earth grew dark at noonday  till the flash of the thin lightning through the wide sky leapt  and tumbling showers scoured along the plain  then folk who saw the pilgrim penitent  drenched  weird  and hastening as as to some strange doom  swore that the wandering jew had crossed their land  and the lord christ had sent the deadly bolt harmless upon his cursed  immortal head  at length the hill side city s spires and roofs  with all its western windows smitten red by a rich sunset  and with massive towers of its cathedral overtopping all  greeted his sight   some weary paces more  and as the twilight deepened in the streets  he stood within the minster   how serene  in sculptured calm of centuries  it seemed  how cool and spacious all the dim lit aisles  still hazy with fumes of frankincense  the vesper had been said  yet here and there a wrinkled beldam  or mourner veiled  or burly burgher on the cold floor knelt  and still the organist  with wandering hands  drew from the keys mysterious melodies  and filled the church with flying waifs of song  that with ethereal beauty moved the soul to a more tender prayer and gentler faith than choral anthems and the solemn mass  a thousand memories  sweet to bitterness  rushed on the knight and filled his eyes with tears  youth s blamelessness and faith forever lost  the love of his neglected lyre  his art  revived by these aerial harmonies  he was unworthy now to touch the strings  too base to stir men s soul to ecstasy and high resolves  as in the days agone  and yet  with all his spirit s earnestness  he yearned to feel the lyre between his hands  to utter all the trouble of his life unto the muse who understands and helps  outworn with travel  soothed to drowsiness by dying music and sweet scented air  his limbs relaxed  and sleep possessed his frame  auroral light the eastern oriels touched  when with delicious sense of rest he woke  amidst the cast and silent empty aisles   god s peace hath fallen upon me in this place  this is my bethel  here i feel again a holy calm  if not of innocence  yet purest after that  the calm serene of expiation and forgiveness   he spake  and passed with staff and wallet forth through the tall portal to the open square  and turning  paused to look upon the pile  the northern front against the crystal sky loomed dark and heavy  full of sombre shade  with each projecting buttress  carven cross  gable and mullion  tipped with laughing light by the slant sunbeams of the risen morn  the noisy swallows wheeled above their nests  builded in hidden nooks about the porch  no human life was stirring in the square  save now and then a rumbling market team  fresh from the fields and farms without the town  he knelt upon the broad cathedral steps  and kissed the moistened stone  while overhead the circling swallows sang  and all around the mighty city lay asleep and still      to stranger s ears must yet again be made the terrible confession  yet again a deathly chill  with something worse than fear  seized the knight s heart  who knew his every word widened the gulf between his kind and him  the bishop sat with pomp of mitred head  in pride of proven virtue  hearkening to all with cold  official apathy  nor made a sign of pity nor encouragement  the friar understood the pilgrim s grief  the language of his eyes  his speech alone was alien to these kind  untutored ears  but this was truly to be misconstrued  to tear each palpitating word alive from out the depths of his remorseful soul  and have it weighed with the precision cool and the nice logic of a reasoning mind  this spiritual father judged his crime as the mad mischief of a reckless boy  that call for strict  immediate punishment  but tannhauser  who felt himself a man  though base  yet fallen through passions and rare gifts of an exuberant nature rankly rich  and knew his weary head was growing gray with a life s terrible experience  found his old sense of proper worth revive  but modestly he ended   yet i felt  o holy father  in the church  this morn  a strange security  a peace serene  as though e en yet the lord regarded me with merciful compassion  yea  as though even so vile a worm as i might work mine own salvation  through repentant prayers    presumptuous man  it is no easy task to expiate such sin  a space of prayer that deprecates the anger of the lord  a pilgrimage through pleasant summer lands  may not atone for years of impious lust  thy heart hath lied to thee in offering hope    is there no hope on earth   the pilgrim sighed   none through thy penance   said the saintly man   yet there may be through mediation  help  there is a man who by a blameless life hath won the right to intercede with god  no sins of his own flesh hath he to purge    the cardinal filippo   he abides  within the holy city   seek him out  this is my only counsel   through thyself can be no help and no forgiveness       how different from the buoyant joy of morn was this discouraged sense of lassitude  the bishop s words were ringing in his ears  measured and pitiless  and blent with these  the memory of the goddess  last wild cry     once being mine  thou art forever mine   was it the truth  despite his penitence  and the dedication of his thought to god  that still some portion of himself was hers  some lust survived  some criminal regret  for her corrupted love   he searched his heart  all was remorse  religious and sincere  and yet her dreadful curse still haunted him  for all men shunned him  and denied him help  knowing at once in looking on his face  ploughed with deep lines and prematurely old  that he had struggled with some deadly fiend  and that he was no longer kin to them  just past the outskirts of the town  he stopped  to strengthen will and courage to proceed  the storm had broken o er the sultry streets  but now the lessening clouds were flying east  and though the gentle shower still wet his face  the west was cloudless while the sun went down  and the bright seven colored arch stood forth  against the opposite dull gray   there was a beauty in the mingled storm and peace  beyond clear sunshine  as the vast  green fields basked in soft light  though glistening yet with rain  the roar of all the town was now a buzz less than the insects  drowsy murmuring that whirred their gauzy wings around his head  the breeze that follows on the sunsetting was blowing whiffs of bruised and dripping grass into the heated city   but he stood  disconsolate with thoughts of fate and sin  still wrestling with his soul to win it back from her who claimed it to eternity  then on the delicate air there came to him the intonation of the minster bells  chiming the vespers  musical and faint  he knew not what of dear and beautiful there was in those familiar peals  that spake of his first boyhood and his innocence  leading him back  with gracious influence  to pleasant thoughts and tender memories  and last  recalling the fair hour of hope he passed that morning in the church   again  the glad assurance of god s boundless love filled all his being  and he rose serene  and journeyed forward with a calm content      southward he wended  and the landscape took a warmer tone  the sky a richer light  the gardens of the graceful  festooned with hops  with their slight tendrils binding pole to pole  gave place to orchards and the trellised grape  the hedges were enwreathed with trailing vines  with clustering  shapely bunches   midst the growth of tangled greenery   the elm and ash less frequent grew than cactus  cypresses  and golden fruited or large blossomed trees  the far hills took the hue of the dove s breast  veiled in gray mist of olive groves   no more he passed dark  moated strongholds of grim knights  but terraces with marble paven steps  with fountains leaping in the sunny air  and hanging gardens full of sumptuous bloom  then cloisters guarded by their dead gray walls  where now and then a golden globe of fruit or full flushed flower peered out upon the road  nodding against the stone  and where he heard sometimes the voices of the chanting monks  sometimes the laugh of children at their play  amidst the quaint  old gardens   but these sights were in the suburbs of the wealthy towns  for many a day through wildernesses rank  or marshy  feverous meadow lands he fared  the fierce sun smiting his close muffled head  or  midst the alpine gorges faced the storm  that drave adown the gullies melted snow and clattering boulders from the mountain tops  at times  between the mountains and the sea fair prospects opened  with the boundless stretch of restless  tideless water by his side  and their long wash upon the yellow sand  beneath this generous sky the country folk could lead a freer life   the fat  green fields offered rich pasturage  athwart the air rang tinkling cow bells and the shepherds  pipes  the knight met many a strolling troubadour  bearing his cithern  flute  or dulcimer  and oft beneath some castle s balcony  at night  he heard their mellow voices rise  blent with stringed instruments or tambourines  chanting some lay as natural as a bird s  then nature stole with healthy influence into his thoughts  his love of beauty woke  his muse inspired dreams as in the past  but after this came crueler remorse  and he would tighten round his loins the rope  and lie for hours beside some wayside cross  and feel himself unworthy to enjoy the splendid gift and privilege of life  then forth he hurried  spurred by his desire to reach the city of the seven hills  and gain his absolution   some leagues more would bring him to the vast campagna land  when by a roadside well he paused to rest   t was noon  and reapers in the field hard by lay neath the trees upon the sun scorched grass  but from their midst one came towards the well  not trudging like a man forespent with toil  but frisking like a child at holiday  with light steps   the pilgrim watched him come  and found him scarcely older than a child  a large mouthed earthen pitcher in his hand  and a guitar upon his shoulder slung  a wide straw hat threw all his face in shade  but doffing this  to catch whatever breeze might stir among the branches  he disclosed a charming head of rippled  auburn hair  a frank  fair face  as lovely as a girls  with great  soft eyes  as mild and grave as kine s  above his head he slipped the instrument  and laid it with his hat upon the turf  lowered his pitcher down the well head cool  and drew it dripping upward  ere he saw the watchful pilgrim  craving  as he thought  the precious draught    your pardon  holy sir  drink first   he cried   before i take the jar unto my father in the reaping field   touched by the cordial kindness of the lad  the pilgrim answered    thanks  my thirst is quenched from mine own palm    the stranger deftly poised the brimming pitcher on his head  and turned back to the reaping folk  while tannhauser looked after him across the sunny fields  clasping each hand about his waist to bear the balanced pitcher  then  down glancing  found the lad s guitar near by  and fell at once to striking its tuned string with wandering hands  and pensive eyes filled full of tender dreams   yea  holy sir  it is a worthless thing  and yet i love it  for i make it speak   the boy again stood by him and dispelled his train of fantasies half sweet  half sad   that was not in my thought   the knight replied   its worth is more than rubies  whoso hath the art to make this speak is raised thereby above all loneliness or grief or fear   more to himself than to the lad he spake  who  understanding not  stood doubtfully at a loss for answer  but the knight went on   how came it in your hands  and who hath tuned your voice to follow it     i am unskilled  good father  but my mother smote its strings to music rare    diverted from one theme  pleased with the winsome candor of the boy  the knight encouraged him to confidence  then his own gift of minstrelsy revealed  and told bright tales of his first wanderings  when in lords  castles and kings  palaces men still made place for him  for in his land the gift was rare and valued at its worth  and brought great victory and sounding fame  thus  in retracing all his pleasant youth  his suffering passed as though it had not been  wide eyed and open mouthed the boy gave ear  his fair face flushing with the sudden thoughts that went and came   then  as the pilgrim ceased  drew breath and spake   and where now is your lyre   the knight with both hands hid his changed  white face  crying aloud   lost  lost  forever lost   then  gathering strength  he bared his face again unto the frightened  wondering boy  and rose with hasty fear    ah  child  you bring me back unwitting to remembrance of my grief  for which i donned eternal garb of woe  and yet i owe you thanks for one sweet hour of healthy human intercourse and peace   t is not for me to tarry by the way  farewell    the impetuous  remorseful boy  seeing sharp pain on that kind countenance  fell at his feet and cried   forgive my words  witless but innocent  and leave me not without a blessing    moved unutterably  the pilgrim kissed with trembling lips his head  and muttered   at this moment would to god that i were worthy    then waved wasted hands over the youth in act of blessing him  but faltered   cleanse me through his innocence  o heavenly father   and with quickening steps hastened away upon the road to rome  the noon was past  the reapers drew broad swaths with scythes sun smitten  midst the ripened crop  thin shadows of the afternoon slept soft on the green meadows as the knight passed forth      he trudged amidst the sea of poisonous flowers on the campagna s undulating plain  with rome  the many steepled  many towered  before him regnant on her throne of hills  a thick blue cloud of haze o erhung the town  but the fast sinking sun struck fiery light from shining crosses  roofs  and flashing domes  across his path an arching bridge of stone was raised above a shrunken yellow stream  hurrying with the light on every wave towards the great town and outward to the sea  upon the bridge s crest he paused  and leaned against the barrier  throwing back his cowl  and gazed upon the dull  unlovely flood that was the tiber   quaggy banks lay bare  muddy and miry  glittering in the sun  and myriad insects hovered o er the reeds  whose lithe  moist tips by listless airs were stirred  when the low sun had dropped behind the hills  he found himself within the streets of rome  walking as in a sleep  where naught seemed real  the chattering hubbub of the market place was over now  but voices smote his ear of garrulous citizens who jostled past  loud cries  gay laughter  snatches of sweet song  the tinkling fountains set in gardens cool about the pillared palaces  and blent with trickling of the conduits in the squares  the noisy teams within the narrow streets    all these the stranger heard and did not hear  while ringing bells pealed out above the town  and calm gray twilight skies stretched over it  wide open stood the doors of every church  and through the porches pressed a streaming throng  vague wonderment perplexed him  at the sight of broken columns raised to jupiter beside the cross  immense cathedrals reared upon a dead faith s ruins  all the whirl and eager bustle of the living town filling the storied streets  whose very stones were solemn monuments  and spake of death  although he wrestled with himself  the thought of that poor  past religion smote his heart with a huge pity and deep sympathy  beyond the fervor which the church inspired  where was the noble race who ruled the world  moulded of purest elements  and stuffed with sternest virtues  every man a king  wearing the purple native in his heart  these lounging beggars  stealthy monks and priests  and womanish patricians filled their place  thus tannhauser  still half an infidel  pagan through mind and christian through the heart  fared thoughtfully with wandering  aimless steps  till in the dying glimmer of the day he raised his eyes and found himself alone amid the ruined arches  broken shafts  and huge arena of the coliseum  he did not see it as it was  dim lit by something less than day and more than night  with wan reflections of the rising moon rather divined than seen on ivied walls  and crumbled battlements  and topless columns   but by the light of all the ancient days  ringed with keen eager faces  living eyes  fixed on the circus with a savage joy  where brandished swords flashed white  and human blood streamed o er the thirsty dust  and death was king  he started  shuddering  and drew breath to see the foul pit choked with weeds and tumbled stones  the cross raised midmost  and the peaceful moon shining o er all  and fell upon his knees  restored to faith in one wise  loving god  day followed day  and still he bode in rome  waiting his audience with the cardinal  and from the gates  on pretext frivolous  passed daily forth   his eminency slept    again  his eminency was fatigued by tedious sessions of the papal court  and thus the patient pilgrim was referred unto a later hour   at last the page bore him a missive with filippo s seal  that in his name commended tannhauser unto the pope   the worn  discouraged knight read the brief scroll  then sadly forth again  along the bosky alleys of the park  passed to the glare and noise of summer streets   good god   he muttered   thou hast ears for all  and sendest help and comfort  yet these men  thy saintly ministers  must deck themselves with arrogance  and from their large delight in all the beauty of the beauteous earth  and peace of indolent  untempted souls  deny the hungry outcast a bare word   yet even as he nourished bitter thoughts  he felt a depth of clear serenity  unruffled in his heart beneath it all  no outward object now had farther power to wound him there  for the brooding o er those deeps of vast contrition was boundless hope      yet not to leave a human chance untried  he sought the absolution of the pope  in a great hall with airy galleries  thronged with high dignitaries of the church  he took his seat amidst the humblest friars  through open windows came sweet garden smells  bright morning light  and twittered song of birds  around the hall flashed gold and sunlit gems  and splendid wealth of color   white stoled priests  and scarlet cardinals  and bishops clad in violet vestments   while beneath the shade of the high gallery huddled dusky shapes  with faded  travel tattered  sombre smocks  and shaven heads  and girdles of coarse hemp  some  pilgrims penitent like tannhauser  some  devotees to kiss the sacred feet  the brassy blare of trumpets smote the air  shrill pipes and horns with swelling clamor came  and through the doorway s wide stretched tapestries passed the pope s trumpeters and mace bearers  his vergers bearing slender silver wands  then mitred bishops  red clad cardinals  the stalwart papal guard with halberds raised  and then  with white head crowned with gold ingemmed  the vicar of the lowly galilean  holding his pastoral rod of smooth hewn wood  with censer swung before and peacock fans waved constantly by pages  either side  attended thus  they bore him to his throne  and priests and laymen fell upon their knees  then  after pause of brief and silent prayer  the pilgrims singly through the hall defiled  to kiss the borders of the papal skirts  smiting their foreheads on the paven stone  some silent  abject  some accusing them of venial sins in accents of remorse  craving his grace  and passing pardoned forth  sir tannhauser came last  no need for him to cry  peccavi   and crook suppliant knees  his gray head rather crushed than bowed  his face livid and wasted  his deep thoughtful eyes  his tall gaunt form in those unseemly weeds  spake more than eloquence   his hollow voice brake silence  saying   i am tannhauser  for seven years i lived apart from men  within the venusberg    a horror seized the assembled folk  some turbulently rose  some clamored   from the presence cast him forth   but the knight never ceased his steady gaze upon the pope   at last    i have not spoken to be condemned   he said   by such as these  thou  spiritual father  answer me  look thou upon me with the eyes of christ  can i through expiation gain my shrift  and work mine own redemption     insolent man   thundered the outraged pope   is this the tone wherewith thou dost parade thy loathsome sin  down on thy knees  and wallow on the earth  nay  rather go  there is no ray of hope  no gleam  through cycles of eternity  for the redemption of a soul like thine  yea  sooner shall my pastoral rod branch forth in leaf and blossom  and green shoots of spring  than christ will pardon thee    and as he spoke  he struck the rod upon the floor with force that gave it entrance  twixt two loosened tiles  so that it stood  fast rooted and alone  the knight saw naught  he only heard his judge ring forth his curses  and the court cry out  anathema   and loud  and blent therewith  derisive laughter in the very hall  and a wild voice that thrilled through flesh and heart   once being mine  thou art forever mine   half mad he clasped both hands upon his brow  amidst the storm of voices  till they died  and all was silence  save the reckless song of a young bird upon a twig without  then a defiant  ghastly face he raised  and shrieked    t is false   i am no longer thine   and through the windows open to the park  rushed forth  beyond the sight and sound of men      by church nor palace paused he  till he passed all squares and streets  and crossed the bridge of stone  and stood alone amidst the broad expanse of the campagna  twinkling in the heat  he knelt upon a knoll of turf  and snapped the cord that held the cross about his neck  and far from him the leaden burden flung   o god   i thank thee  that my faith in thee subsists at last  through all discouragements  between us must no type nor symbol stand  no mediator  were he more divine than the incarnate christ   all forms  all priests  i part aside  and hold communion free beneath the empty sky of noon  with naught between my nothingness and thy high heavens   spirit with spirit   o  have mercy  god  cleanse me from lust and bitterness and pride  have mercy in accordance with my faith   long time he lay upon the scorching grass  with his face buried in the tangled weeds  ah  who can tell the struggles of his soul against its demons in that sacred hour  the solitude  the anguish  the remorse  when shadows long and thin lay on the ground  shivering with fever  helpless he arose  but with a face divine  ineffable  such as we dream the face of israel  when the lord s wrestling angel  at gray dawn  blessed him  and disappeared                                   upon the marsh  all night  he wandered  striving to emerge from the wild  pathless plain   now limitless and colorless beneath the risen moon  outstretching like a sea  with landmarks none  save broken aqueducts and parapets  and ruined columns glinting  neath the moon  his dress was dank and clinging with the dew  a thousand insects fluttered o er his head  with buzz and drone  unseen cicadas chirped among the long  rank grass  and far and near the fire flies flickered through the summer air  vague thoughts and gleams prophetic filled his brain   ah  fool   he mused   to look for help from men  had they the will to aid  they lack the power  in mine own flesh and soul the sin had birth  through mine own anguish it must be atoned  our saviours are not saints and ministers  but tear strung women  children soft of heart  or fellow sufferers  who  by some chance word  some glance of comfort  save us from despair  these i have found  thank heaven  to strengthen trust in mine own kind  when all the world grew dark  make me not proud in spirit  o my god  yea  in thy sight i am one mass of sin  one black and foul corruption  yet i know my frailty is exceeded by thy love  neither is this the slender straw of hope  whereto i  drowning  cling  but firm belief  that fills my inmost soul with vast content  as surely as the hollow faiths of old shriveled to dust before one ray of truth  so will these modern temples pass away  piled upon rotten doctrines  baseless forms  and man will look in his own breast for help  yea  search for comfort his own inward reins  revere himself  and find the god within  patience and patience    through the sleepless night he held such thoughts  at times before his eyes flashed glimpses of the church that was to be  sublimely simple in the light serene of future ages  then the vision changed to the pope s hall  thronged with high priests  who hurled their curses on him   staggering  he awoke unto the truth  and found himself alone  beneath the awful stars   when dawn s first chill crept though the shivering grass and heavy leaves  giddy and overcome  he fell and slept upon the dripping weeds  nor dreamed nor stirred  until the wide plain basked in noon s broad light  he dragged his weary frame some paces more  unto a solitary herdsman s hut  which  in the vagueness of the moonlit night  was touched with lines of beauty  till it grew fair as the ruined works of ancient art  now squat and hideous with its wattled roof  decaying timbers  and loose door wide oped  half fallen from the hinge   a drowsy man  bearded and burnt  in shepherd habit lay  stretched on the floor  slow munching  half asleep  his frugal fare  for thus  at blaze of noon  the shepherds sought a shelter from the sun  leaving their vigilant dogs beside their flock  the knight craved drink and bread  and with respect for pilgrim weeds  the roman herdsman stirred his lazy length  and shared with him his meal  refreshed and calm  sir tannhauser passed forth  yearning with morbid fancy once again to see the kind face of the minstrel boy he met beside the well   at set of sun he reached the place  the reaping folk were gone  the day s toil over  yet he took his seat  a milking girl with laden buckets full  came slowly from the pasture  paused and drank  from a near cottage ran a ragged boy  and filled his wooden pail  and to his home returned across the fields   a herdsman came  and drank and gave his dog to drink  and passed  greeting the holy man who sat there still  awaiting   but his feeble pulse beat high when he descried at last a youthful form  crossing the field  a pitcher on his head  advancing towards the well   yea  this was he  the same grave eyes  and open  girlish face  but he saw not  amidst the landscape brown  the knight s brown figure  who  to win his ear  asked the lad s name    my name is salvator  to serve you  sir   he carelessly replied  with eyes and hands intent upon his jar  brimming and bubbling   then he cast one glance upon his questioner  and left the well  crying with keen and sudden sympathy   good father  pardon me  i knew you not  ah  you have travelled overmuch  your feet are grimed with mud and wet  your face is changed  your hands are dry with fever    but the knight   nay  as i look on thee  i think the lord wills not that i should suffer any more    then you have suffered much   sighed salvator  with wondering pity    you must come with me  my father knows of you  i told him all  a knight and minstrel who cast by his lyre  his health and fame  to give himself to god    yours is a life indeed to be desired  if you will lie with us this night  our home will verily be blessed    by kindness crushed  wandering in sense and words  the broken knight resisted naught  and let himself be led to the boy s home   the outcast and accursed was welcomed now by kindly human hands  once more his blighted spirit was revived by contact with refreshing innocence  there  when the morning broke upon the world  the humble hosts no longer knew their guest  his fleshly weeds of sin forever doffed  tannhauser lay and smiled  for in the night the angel came who brings eternal peace                                      far into wartburg  through all italy  in every town the pope sent messengers  riding in furious haste  among them  one who bore a

of mine that the preceding unrhymed narratives can    enter into competition with the elaborate poems of the author    of  the earthly paradise   yet the similarity of subjects     and the imputation of plagiarism already made in private    circles  induce me to remark that  admetus  was completed    before the publication of the  love of alcestis   and     tannhauser  before the  hill of venus

gray mist  gray sky  through vapors hurrying by  larger than wont  on high   floats the horned  yellow moon  chill airs are faintly stirred  and far away is heard  of some fresh awakened bird    the querulous  shrill tune    the dark mist hides the face of the dim land  no trace of rock or river s place   in the thick air is drawn  but dripping grass smells sweet  and rustling branches meet  and sounding water greet   the slow  sure  sacred dawn    past is the long black night  with its keen lightnings white  thunder and floods  new light   the glimmering low east streaks  the dense clouds part  between their jagged rents are seen pale reaches blue and green    as the mirk curtain breaks    above the shadowy world  still more and more unfurled  the gathered mists upcurled   like phantoms melt and pass  in clear obscure revealed  brown wood  gray stream  dark field  fresh  healthy odors yield   wet furrows  flowers  and grass    the sudden  splendid gleam of one thin  golden beam shoots from the feathered rim   of yon hill crowned with woods  down its embowered side  as living waters slide  so the great morning tide   follows in sunny floods    from bush and hedge and tree joy  unrestrained and free  breaks forth in melody    twitter and chirp and song  alive the festal air with gauze winged creatures fair  that flicker everywhere    dart  poise  and flash along    the shining mists are gone  slight films of gold swift blown before the strong  bright sun   or the deep colored sky  a world of life and glow sparkles and basks below  where the soft meads a row    hoary with dew fall  lie    does not the morn break thus  swift  bright  victorious  with new skies cleared for us    over the soul storm tost  her night was long and deep  strange visions vexed her sleep  strange sorrows bade her weep    her faith in dawn was lost    no halt  no rest for her  the immortal wanderer from sphere to higher sphere    toward the pure source of day  the new light shames her fears  her faithlessness  her tears  as the new sun appears   to light her godlike way                     saint romualdo    i give god thanks that i  a lean old man  wrinkled  infirm  and crippled with keen pains by austere penance and continuous toil  now rest in spirit  and possess  the peace which passeth understanding   th  end draws nigh  though the beginning is yesterday  and a broad lifetime spreads  twixt this and that   a favored life  though outwardly the butt of ignominy  malice  and affront  yet lighted from within by the clear star of a high aim  and graciously prolonged to see at last its utmost goal attained  i speak not of mine order and my house  here founded by my hands and filled with saints   a white society of snowy souls  swayed by my voice  by mine example led  for this is but the natural harvest reaped from labors such as mine when blessed by god  though i rejoice to think my spirit still will work my purposes  through worthy hands  after my bones are shriveled into dust  yet have i gleaned a finer  sweeter fruit of holy satisfaction  sure and real  though subtler than the tissue of the air   the power completely to detach the soul from her companion through this life  the flesh  so that in blessed privacy of peace  communing with high angels  she can hold  serenely rapt  her solitary course      ye know  o saints of heaven  what i have borne of discipline and scourge  the twisted lash of knotted rope that striped my shrinking limbs  vigils and fasts protracted  till my flesh wasted and crumbled from mine aching bones  and the last skin  one woof of pain and sores  thereto like yellow parchment loosely clung  exposure to the fever and the frost  when  mongst the hollows of the hills i lurked from persecution of misguided folk  accustoming my spirit to ignore the burden of the cross  while picturing the bliss of disembodied souls  the grace of holiness  the lives of sainted men  and entertaining all exalted thoughts  that nowise touched the trouble of the hour  until the grief and pain seemed far less real than the creations of my brain inspired  the vision  the beatitude  were true  the agony was but an evil dream  i speak not now as one who hath not learned the purport of those lightly bandied words  evil and fate  but rather one who knows the thunders of the terrors of the world  no mortal chance or change  no earthly shock  can move or reach my soul  securely throned on heights of contemplation and calm prayer  happy  serene  no less actual joy of present peace than faith in joys to come      this soft  sweet  yellow evening  how the trees stand crisp against the clear  bright colored sky  how the white mountain tops distinctly shine  taking and giving radiance  and the slopes are purpled with rich floods of peach hued light  thank god  my filmy  old dislustred eyes find the same sense of exquisite delight  my heart vibrates to the same touch of joy in scenes like this  as when my pulse danced high  and youth coursed through my veins   this the one link that binds the wan old man that now i am to the wild lad who followed up the hounds among ravenna s pine woods by the sea  for there how oft would i lose all delight in the pursuit  the triumph  or the game  to stray alone among the shadowy glades  and gaze  as one who is not satisfied with gazing  at the large  bright  breathing sea  the forest glooms  and shifting gleams between the fine dark fringes of the fadeless trees  on gold green turf  sweet brier  and wild pink rose  how rich that buoyant air with changing scent of pungent pine  fresh flowers  and salt cool seas  and when all echoes of the chase had died  of horn and halloo  bells and baying hounds  how mine ears drank the ripple of the tide on the fair shore  the chirp of unseen birds  the rustling of the tangled undergrowth  and the deep lyric murmur of the pines  when through their high tops swept the sudden breeze  there was my world  there would my heart dilate  and my aspiring soul dissolve in prayer unto that spirit of love whose energies were active round me  yet whose presence  sphered in the unsearchable  unbodied air  made itself felt  but reigned invisible  this ere the day that made me what i am  still can i see the hot  bright sky  the sea illimitably sparkling  as they showed that morning   though i deemed i took no note of heaven or earth or waters  yet my mind retains to day the vivid portraiture of every line and feature of the scene  light hearted  midst the dewy lanes i fared unto the sea  whose jocund gleam i caught between the slim boles  when i heard the clink of naked weapons  then a sudden thrust sickening to hear  and then a stifled groan  and pressing forward i beheld the sight that seared itself for ever on my brain   my kinsman  ser ranieri  on the turf  fallen upon his side  his bright young head among the pine spurs  and his cheek pressed close unto the moist  chill sod  his fingers clutched a handful of loose weeds and grass and earth  uprooted in his anguish as he fell  and slowly from his heart the thick stream flowed  fouling the green  leaving the fair  sweet face ghastly  transparent  with blue  stony eyes staring in blankness on that other one who triumphed over him   with hot desire of instant vengeance i unsheathed my sword to rush upon the slayer  when he turned in his first terror of blood guiltiness                                        within my heart a something snapped and brake  what was it but the chord of rapturous joy for ever stilled   i tottered and would fall  had i not leaned against the friendly pine  for all realities of life  unmoored from their firm anchorage  appeared to float like hollow phantoms past my dizzy brain  the strange delusion wrought upon my soul that this had been enacted ages since  this very horror curdled at my heart  this net of trees spread round  these iron heavens  were closing over me when i had stood  unnumbered cycles back  and fronted him  my father  and he felt mine eyes as now  yet saw me not  and then  as now  that form  the one thing real  lay stretched between us both  the fancy passed  and i stood sane and strong to grasp the truth   then i remembered all   a few fierce words between them yester eve concerning some poor plot of pasturage  soon silenced into courteous  frigid calm  this was the end   i could not meet him now  to curse him  to accuse him  or to save  and draw him from the red entanglement coiled by his own hands round his ruined life  god pardon me   my heart that moment held no drop of pity toward this wretched soul  and cowering down  as though his guilt were mine  i fled amidst the savage silences of that grim wood  resolved to nurse alone my boundless desolation  shame  and grief      there  in that thick leaved twilight of high noon  the quiet of the still  suspended air  once more my wandering thoughts were calmly ranged  shepherded by my will   i wept  i prayed a solemn prayer  conceived in agony  blessed with response instant  miraculous  for in that hour my spirit was at one with him who knows and satisfies her needs  the supplication and the blessing sprang from the same source  inspired divinely both  i prayed for light  self knowledge  guidance  truth  and these like heavenly manna were rained down to feed my hungered soul   his guilt was mine  what angel had been sent to stay mine arm until the fateful moment passed away that would have ushered an eternity of withering remorse   i found the germs in mine own heart of every human sin  that waited but occasion s tempting breath to overgrow with poisoned bloom my life  what god thus far had saved me from myself  here was the lofty truth revealed  that each must feel himself in all  must know where er the great soul acts or suffers or enjoys  his proper soul in kinship there is bound  then my life purpose dawned upon my mind  encouraging as morning   as i lay  crushed by the weight of universal love  which mine own thoughts had heaped upon myself  i heard the clear chime of a slow  sweet bell  i knew it  whence it came and what it sang  from the gray convent nigh the wood it pealed  and called the monks to prayer   vigil and prayer  clean lives  white days of strict austerity  such were the offerings of these holy saints  how far might such not tend to expiate a riotous world s indulgence   here my life  doubly austere and doubly sanctified  might even for that other one atone  so bound to mine  till both should be forgiven      they sheltered me  not questioning the need that led me to their cloistered solitude  how rich  how freighted with pure influence  with dear security of perfect peace  was the first day i passed within those walls  the holy habit of perpetual prayer  the gentle greetings  the rare temperate speech  the chastening discipline  the atmosphere of settled and profound tranquillity  were even as living waters unto one who perisheth of thirst   was this the world that yesterday seemed one huge battlefield for brutish passions   could the soul of man withdraw so easily  and erect apart her own fair temple for her own high ends  but this serene contentment slowly waned as i discerned the broad disparity betwixt the form and spirit of the laws that bound the order in strait brotherhood  yet when i sought to gain a larger love  more rigid discipline  severer truth  and more complete surrender of the soul unto her god  this was to my reproach  and scoffs and gibes beset me on all sides  in mine own cell i mortified my flesh  i held aloof from all my brethren s feasts to wrestle with my viewless enemies  till they should leave their blessing on my head  for nightly was i haunted by that face  white  bloodless  as i saw it  midst the ferns  now staring out of darkness  and it held mine eyes from slumber and my brain from rest and drove me from my straw to weep and pray  rebellious thoughts such subtle torture wrought upon my spirit that i lay day long in dumb despair  until the blessed hope of mercy dawned again upon my soul  as gradual as the slow gold moon that mounts the airy steps of heaven   my faith arose with sure perception that disaster  wrong  and every shadow of man s destiny are merely circumstance  and cannot touch the soul s fine essence  they exist or die only as she affirms them or denies      this faith sustain me even to the end  it floods my heart with peace as surely now as on that day the friars drove me forth  urging that my asceticism  too harsh  endured through pride  would bring into reproach their customs and their order   then began my exile in the mountains  where i bode a hunted man   the elements conspired against me  and i was the seasons  sport  drenched  parched  and scorched and frozen alternately  burned with shrewd frosts  prostrated by fierce heats  shivering  neath chilling dews and gusty rains  and buffeted by all the winds of heaven  yet was this period my time of joy  my daily thoughts perpetual converse held with angels ministrant  mine ears were charmed with sweet accordance of celestial sounds  song  harp and choir  clear ringing through the air  and visions were revealed unto mine eyes by night and day of heaven s very courts  in shadowless  undimmed magnificence  i gave god thanks  not that he sheltered me  and fed me as he feeds the fowls of air   for had i perished  this too had been well   but for the revelation of his truth  the glory  the beatitude vouchsafed to exalt  to heal  to quicken  to inspire  so that the pinched  lean excommunicate was crowned with joy more solid  more secure  than all the comfort of the vales could bring  then the good lord touched certain fervid hearts  aspiring toward his love  to come to me  timid and few at first  but as they heard from mine own lips the precious oracles  that soothed the trouble of their souls  appeased their spiritual hunger  and disclosed all of the god within them to themselves  they flocked about me  and they hailed me saint  and sware to follow and to serve the good which my word published and my life declared  thus the lone hermit of the mountain top descended leader of a band of saints  and midway  twixt the summit and the vale i perched my convent   yet i bated not one whit of strict restraint and abstinence  and they who love me and who serve the truth have learned to suffer with me  and have won the supreme joy that is not of the flesh  foretasting the delights of paradise  this faith  to them imparted  will endure after my tongue hath ceased to utter it  and the great peace hath settled on my soul                       afternoon        small  shapeless drifts of cloud sail slowly northward in the soft hued sky    with blur half tints and rolling summits bright  by the late sun caressed  slight hazes shroud   all things afar  shineth each leaf anigh     with its own warmth and light        o erblown by southland airs  the summer landscape basks in utter peace    in lazy streams the lazy clouds are seen  low hills  broad meadows  and large  clear cut squares   of ripening corn fields  rippled by the breeze      with shifting shade and sheen        hark  and you may not hear a sound less soothing than the rustle cool   of swaying leaves  the steady wiry drone of unseen crickets  sudden chirpings clear   of happy birds  the tinkle of the pool      chafed by a single stone        what vague  delicious dreams  born of this golden hour of afternoon    and air balm freighted  fill the soul with bliss  transpierced like yonder clouds with lustrous gleams    fantastic  brief as they  and  like them  spun     of gilded nothingness        all things are well with her   t is good to be alive  to see the light   that plays upon the grass  to feel  and sigh with perfect pleasure  the mild breezes stir   among the garden roses  red and white      with whiffs of fragrancy        there is no troublous thought  no painful memory  no grave regret    to mar the sweet suggestions of the hour  the soul  at peace  reflects the peace without    forgetting grief as sunset skies forget     the morning s transient shower                       phantasies              after robert schumann                     i  evening    rest  beauty  stillness  not a waif of a cloud from gray blue east sheer to the yellow west   no film of mist the utmost slopes to shroud    the earth lies grace  by quiet airs caressed  and shepherdeth her shadows  but each stream  free to the sky  is by that glow possessed  and traileth with the splendors of a dream athwart the dusky land   uplift thine eyes  unbroken by a vapor or a gleam    the vast clear reach of mild  wan twilight skies  but look again  and lo  the evening star  against the pale tints black the slim elms rise    the earth exhales sweet odors nigh and far  and from the heavens fine influences fall  familiar things stand not for what they are    what they suggest  foreshadow  or recall the spirit is alert to apprehend  imparting somewhat of herself to all    labor and thought and care are at an end  the soul is filled with gracious reveries  and with her mood soft sounds and colors blend    for simplest sounds ring forth like melodies in this weird lighted air  the monotone of some far bell  the distant farmyard cries    a barking dog  the thin  persistent drone of crickets  and the lessening call of birds  the apparition of yon star alone   breaks on the sense like music   beyond word the peace that floods the soul  for night is here  and beauty still is guide and harbinger                      ii  aspiration    dark lies the earth  and bright with worlds the sky  that soft  large  lustrous star  that first outshone  still holds us spelled with potent sorcery    dilating  shrinking  lightening  it hath won our spirit with its strange strong influence  and sways it as the tides beneath the moon    what impulse this  o ermastering heart and sense  exalted  thrilled  the freed soul fain would soar unto that point of shining prominence    craving new fields and some unheard of shore  yea  all the heavens  for her activity  to mount with daring flight  to hover o er   low hills of earth  flat meadows  level sea  and earthly joy and trouble   in this hour of waning light and sound  of mystery    of shadowed love and beauty veiled power  she feels her wings  she yearns to grasp her own  knowing the utmost good to be her dower    a dream  a dream  for at a touch  t is gone  o mocking spirit  thy mere fools are we  unto the depths from heights celestial thrown    from these blind gropings toward reality  this thirst for truth  this most pathetic need of something to uplift  to justify    to help and comfort while we faint and bleed  may we not draw  wrung from the last despair  some argument of hope  some blessed creed    that we can trust the faith which whispers prayer  the vanishings  the ecstasy  the gleam  the nameless aspiration  and the dream                     iii  wherefore    deep languor overcometh mind and frame  a listless  drowsy  utter weariness  a trance wherein no thought finds speech or name    the overstrained spirit doth possess  she sinks with drooping wing  poor unfledged bird  that fain had flown   in fluttering breathlessness    to what end those high hopes that wildly stirred the beating heart with aspirations vain  why proffer prayers unanswered and unheard   to blank  deaf heavens that will not heed her pain  where lead these lofty  soaring tendencies  that leap and fly and poise  to fall again    yet seem to link her with the utmost skies  what mean these clinging loves that bind to earth  and claim her with beseeching  wistful eyes    this little resting place  twixt death and birth  why is it fretted with the ceaseless flow of flood and ebb  with overgrowth and dearth    and vext with dreams  and clouded with strange woe  ah  she is tired of thought  she yearns for peace  seeing all things one equal end must know    wherefore this tangle of perplexities  the trouble or the joy  the weary maze of narrow fears and hopes that may not cease    a chill falls on her from the skyey ways  black with the night tide  where is none to hear the ancient cry  the wherefore of our days                     iv  fancies    the ceaseless whirr of crickets fills the ear from underneath each hedge and bush and tree  deep in the dew drenched grasses everywhere    the simple sound dispels the fantasy of gloom and terror gathering round the mind  it seems a pleasant thing to breathe  to be    to hear the many voiced  soft summer wind lisp through the dark thick leafage overhead   to see the rosy half moon soar behind   the black slim branching elms   sad thoughts have fled  trouble and doubt  and now strange reveries and odd caprices fill us in their stead    from yonder broken disk the redness dies  like gold fruit through the leaves the half sphere gleams  then over the hoar tree tops climbs the skies    blanched ever more and more  until it beams whiter than crystal   like a scroll unfurled  and shadowy as a landscape seen in dreams    reveals itself the sleeping  quiet world  painted in tender grays and whites subdued   the speckled stream with flakes of light impearled    the wide  soft meadow and the massive wood  naught is too wild for our credulity in this weird hour  our finest dreams hold good    quaint elves and frolic flower sprites we see  and fairies weaving rings of gossamer  and angels floating through the filmy air                     v  in the night    let us go in  the air is dank and chill with dewy midnight  and the moon rides high o er ghostly fields  pale stream  and spectral hill    this hour the dawn seems farthest from the sky so weary long the space that lies between that sacred joy and this dark mystery   of earth and heaven  no glimmering is seen  in the star sprinkled east  of coming day  nor  westward  of the splendor that hath been    strange fears beset us  nameless terrors sway the brooding soul  that hungers for her rest  out worn with changing moods  vain hopes  delay    with conscious thought o erburdened and oppressed  the mystery and the shadow wax too deep  she longs to merge both sense and thought in sleep                     vi  faerie    from the oped lattice glance once more abroad while the ethereal moontide bathes with light hill  stream  and garden  and white winding road    all gracious myths born of the shadowy night recur  and hover in fantastic guise  airy and vague  before the drowsy sight    on yonder soft gray hill endymion lies in rosy slumber  and the moonlit air breathes kisses on his cheeks and lips and eyes     twixt bush and bush gleam flower white limbs  left bare  of huntress nymphs  and flying raiment thin  vanishing faces  and bright floating hair    the quaint midsummer fairies and their kin  gnomes  elves  and trolls  on blossom  branch  and grass gambol and dance  and winding out and in   leave circles of spun dew where er they pass  through the blue ether the freed ariel flies  enchantment holds the air  a swarming mass   of myriad dusky  gold winged dreams arise  throng toward the gates of sense  and so possess the soul  and lull it to forgetfulness                  vii  confused dreams    o strange  dim other world revealed to us  beginning there where ends reality  lying  twixt life and death  and populous   with souls from either sphere  now enter we thy twisted paths   barred is the silver gate  but the wild carven doors of ivory   spring noiselessly apart  between them straight flies forth a cloud of nameless shadowy things  with harpies  imps  and monsters  small and great    blurring the thick air with darkening wings  all humors of the blood and brain take shape  and fright us with our own imaginings    a trouble weighs upon us  no escape from this unnatural region can there be  fixed eyes stare on us  wide mouths grin and gape    familiar faces out of reach we see  fain would we scream  to shatter with a cry the tangled woof of hideous fantasy    when  lo  the air grows clear  a soft fair sky shines over head  sharp pain dissolves in peace  beneath the silver archway quietly   we float away  all troublous visions cease  by a strange sense of joy we are possessed  body and spirit soothed in perfect rest                  viii  the end of the song    what dainty note of long drawn melody athwart our dreamless sleep rings sweet and clear  till all the fumes of slumber are brushed by    and with awakened consciousness we hear the pipe of birds   look forth   the sane  white day blesses the hilltops  and the sun is near    all misty phantoms slowly roll away with the night s vapors toward the western sky  the real enchants us  the fresh breath of hay   blows toward us  soft the meadow grasses lie  bearded with dew  the air is a caress  the sudden sun o ertops the boundary   of eastern hills  the morning joyousness thrills tingling through the frame  life s pulse beats strong  night s fancies melt like dew   so ends the song            on the proposal to erect a monument           in england to lord byron    the grass of fifty aprils hath waved green   above the spent heart  the olympian head  the hands crost idly  the shut eyes unseen    unseeing  the locked lips whose song hath fled  yet mystic lived  like some rich  tropic flower  his fame puts forth fresh blossoms hour by hour  wide spread the laden branches dropping dew   on the low  laureled brow misunderstood    that bent not  neither bowed  until subdued by the last foe who crowned while he o erthrew    fair was the easter sabbath morn when first   men heard he had not wakened to its light  the end had come  and time had done its worst    for the black cloud had fallen of endless night  then in the town  as greek accosted greek   t was not the wonted festal words to speak   christ is arisen   but  our chief is gone     with such wan aspect and grief smitten head   as when the awful cry of  pan is dead   filled echoing hill and valley with its moan     i am more fit for death than the world deems     so spake he as life s light was growing dim  and turned to sleep as unto soothing dreams    what terrors could its darkness hold for him  familiar with all anguish  but with fear still unacquainted   on his martial bier they laid a sword  a helmet  and a crown     meed of the warrior  but not these among   his voiceless lyre  whose silent chords unstrung shall wait  how long

home  their exiled glory  past the guarded gate where england s abbey shelters england s great  afar he rests whose very name hath shed   new lustre on her with the song he sings    so shakespeare rests who scorned to lie with kings  sleeping at peace midst the unhonored dead    and fifty years suffice to overgrow   with gentle memories the foul weeds of hate that shamed his grave   the world begins to know   her loss  and view with other eyes his fate  even as the cunning workman brings to pass the sculptor s thought from out the unwieldy mass of shapeless marble  so time lops away   the stony crust of falsehood that concealed   his just proportions  and  at last revealed  the statue issues to the light of day    most beautiful  most human   let them fling   the first stone who are

undistinguished multitude  brave as the silent myriads are  crushed by the juggernaut world car  strong with the people s strength  yet mild  simple and tender as a child  wise with the wisdom of the

he murmured in his pain   to see the people once again   oh  how they loved him   they stood there  thronging the road  the street  the square  with hushed lips locked in silent prayer  uncovered heads and streaming eyes  breathless as when a father dies  the records of the ghostly ride  past town and field at morning tide    when life s full stream is wont to gush through all its ways with boisterous rush    the records note that once a hound had barked  and once was heard the sound of cart wheels rumbling on the stones   and once  mid stifled sobs and groans  one man dared audibly

below the burning billows rolled  and all the sea sang like a smitten lyre  oh  the wild voices of those chanting waves    the human faces glimpsed beneath the tide  familiar eyes gazed from profound

sweet    the clinging waters part before their way  jewels of flame are dancing  neath their feet    up in the sunshine  in soft foam  they lay their precious burden  and return forlorn  oh  bliss  oh

wail outrings the chafed  tumultuous surge  ocean and earth  the illimitable skies    prolong one note  a mourning for the dead    the cry of souls not to be comforted  what piercing music   funeral visions rise  and send the hot tears raining down our cheek    we see the silent grave upon the hill   with its lone lilac bush   o heart  be still  she will not rise  she will not stir nor speak

affrighted they will scatter at a sound  leap in their cool sea chambers  nimbly fleet  and we shall doubt that we have ever seen    while our sane eyes behold stray wreaths of mist    shot with faint colors by the moon rays kissed  floating snow soft  snow white  where these had been  already  look  the wave washed sands are bare  and mocking laughter ripples through the air                       epilogue    forth in the sunlit  rain bathed air we stepped    sweet with the dripping grass and flowering vine    and saw through irised clouds the pale sun shine  back o er the hills the rain mist slowly crept like a transparent curtain s slivery sheen    and fronting us the painted bow was arched    whereunder the majestic cloud shapes marched  in the wet  yellow light the dazzling green of lawn and bush and tree seemed stained with blue    our hearts o erflowed with peace   with smiles we spake of partings in the past  of courage new    of high achievement  of the dreams that make a

dark  green grove  the luminous grasses  and the merry sun in the grave sky  the sparkle far and wide  laughter of unseen children  cheerful chirp of crickets  and low lisp of rippling tide  light

the cranes of ibycus    there was a man who watched the river flow past the huge town  one gray november day  round him in narrow high piled streets at play the boys made merry as they saw him go  murmuring half loud  with eyes upon the stream  the immortal screed he held within his hand  for he was walking in an april land with faust and helen   shadowy as a dream was the prose world  the river and the town  wild joy possessed him  through enchanted skies he saw the cranes of ibycus swoop down  he closed the page  he lifted up his eyes  lo  a black line of birds in wavering thread bore

sensuous  nor impassioned  therefore he is not a poet      no man had ever heard a nightingale  when once a keen eyed naturalist was stirred to study and define  what is a bird  to classify by rote and book  nor fail to mark its structure and to note the scale whereon its song might possibly be heard  thus far  no farther   so he spake the word  when of a sudden   hark  the nightingale    oh deeper  higher than he could divine that all unearthly  untaught strain   he saw the plain  brown warbler  unabashed    not mine   he cried   the error of this fatal flaw  no bird is this  it soars beyond my line  were it a bird   t would answer to my law                  st  michael s chapel    when the vexed hubbub of our world of gain roars round about me as i walk the street  the myriad noise of traffic  and the beat of toil s incessant hammer  the fierce strain of struggle hand to hand and brain to brain  ofttimes a sudden dream my sense will cheat  the gaudy shops  the sky piled roofs retreat  and all at once i stand enthralled again within a marble minster over seas  i watch the solemn gold stained gloom that creeps to kiss an alabaster tomb  where sleeps a lady  twixt two knights  stone effigies  and every day in dusky glory steeps their sculptured slumber of five centuries                    life and art    not while the fever of the blood is strong  the heart throbs loud  the eyes are veiled  no less with passion than with tears  the muse shall bless the poet soul to help and soothe with song  not then she bids his trembling lips express the aching gladness  the voluptuous pain  life is his poem then  flesh  sense  and brain one full stringed lyre attuned to happiness  but when the dream is done  the pulses fail  the day s illusion  with the day s sun set  he

               city visions                        i    as the blind milton s memory of light  the deaf beethoven s phantasy of tone  wrought joys for them surpassing all things known in our restricted sphere of sound and sight    so while the glaring streets of brick and stone vex with heat  noise  and dust from morn till night  i will give rein to fancy  taking flight from dismal now and here  and dwell alone with new enfranchised senses   all day long  think ye  t is i  who sit  twixt darkened walls  while ye chase beauty over land and sea  uplift on wings of some rare poet s song  where the wide billow laughs and leaps and falls  i soar cloud high  free as the the winds are free                          ii    who grasps the substance  who  mid shadows strays  he who within some dark bright wood reclines   twixt sleep and waking  where the needled pines have cushioned all his couch with soft brown sprays  he notes not how the living water shines  trembling along the cliff  a flickering haze  brimming a wine bright pool  nor lifts his gaze to read the ancient wonders and the signs  does he possess the actual  or do i  who paint on air more than his sense receives  the glittering pine tufts with closed eyes behold  breathe the strong resinous perfume  see the sky quiver like azure flame between the leaves  and open unseen gates with key of gold                        influence    the fervent  pale faced mother ere she sleep  looks out upon the zigzag lighted square  the beautiful bare trees  the blue night air  the revelation of the star strewn deep  world above world  and heaven over heaven  between the tree tops and the skies  her sight rests on a steadfast  ruddy shining light  high in the tower  an earthly star of even  hers is the faith in saints  and angels  power  and mediating love  she breathes a prayer for yon tired watcher in the gray old tower  he the shrewd  skeptic poet unaware feels comforted and stilled  and knows not whence falls this unwonted peace on heart and sense                      restlessness     would i had waked this morn where florence smiles  a bloom with beauty  a white rose full blown  yet rich in sacred dust  in storied stone  precious past all the wealth of indian isles   from olive hoary fiesole to feed on brunelleschi s dome my hungry eye  and see against the lotus colored sky  spring the slim belfry graceful as a reed  to kneel upon the ground where dante trod  to breathe the air of immortality from angelo and raphael  to be   each sense new quickened by a demi god  to hear the liquid tuscan speech at whiles  from citizen and peasant  to behold the heaven of leonardo washed with gold   would i had waked this morn where florence smile    written before visiting florence                              the spagnoletto      dramatis personae   don john of austria  josef ribera  the spagnoletto  lorenzo  noble young italian artist  pupil of ribera  don tommaso manzano  luca  servant to

studio of the spagnoletto  ribera at work before his canvas    maria seated some distance behind him  a piece of embroidery is   in her hands  but she glances up from it incessantly toward her   father with impatient movements    maria  father   ribera  absorbed in his work  makes no reply  she puts by her embroidery  goes toward him and kisses him gently  he starts  looks up at her  and returns her caress     ribera  my child    maria            already you forget  oh  heedless father   did you not promise me to lay aside your brush to day at noon  and tell me the great secret    ribera            ah   t is true  i am to blame   but it is morning yet  my child  wait still a little    maria            t is morning yet  nay  it was noon one mortal hour ago  all patience i have sat till you should turn and beckon me   the rosy angels breathe upon the canvas  i might sit till night  and  if i spake not  you would never glance from their celestial faces   dear my father  your brow is  moist  and yet your hands are ice  your very eyes are tired  pray  rest awhile  the spagnoletto need no longer toil as in the streets of rome for beggars  fare  now princes bide his pleasure    ribera  throws aside his brush and palette            ah  maria  thou speak st in season   let me ne er forget those days of degradation  when i starved before the gates of palaces   the germs stirred then within me of the perfect fruits wherewith my hands have since enriched god s world  vengeance i vowed for every moment s sting   vengeance on wealth  rank  station  fortune  genius  see  while i paint  all else escapes my sense  save this bright throng of phantasies that press upon my brain  each claiming from my hand its immortality   but thou  my child  remind st me of mine oath  my sacred pride  the eternal hatred lodged within my breast  philip of spain shall wait   i will not deign to add to day the final touch of life unto this masterpiece    maria           so  that is well  put by the envious brush that separates father from daughter   now you are all mine own  and now  your secret    ribera           mine    t is none of mine   t is thine  maria   john of austria desires our presence at his ball to night    maria  prince john    ribera           ay  girl  prince john   i looked to see a haughty joy dance sparkling in thine eyes and burn upon thy cheek   but what is this  timid and pale  thou droop st thy head abashed as a poor flower girl whom a lord accosts    maria  forgive me   sure   t is you don john desires the prince of artists     ribera           art   prate not of art  think st thou i move an artist  midst his guests  as such i commune with a loftier race  angels and spirits are my ministers  these do i part aside to grace his halls  a spanish gentleman  and so  his peer    maria  father  i am not well  my head throbs fast  unwonted languor weighs upon my frame    ribera  anger me not  maria    t is my will  thou shalt obey   hell  what these women be  no obstacle would daunt them in the quest of that which  freely given  they reject  hold   haply just occasion bids thee seem unlike thyself   speak fearlessly child  confide to me thy knowledge  thy surmise    maria  hurriedly   no  father  you were right   i have no cause  punish me  nay  forgive  and i obey    ribera  there spake my child  kiss me and be forgiven  sometimes i doubt thou playest upon my love willfully  knowing me as soft as clay  whom the world knows of marble   in such moods  i see my spirit mirror s first  and then from thy large eyes thy sainted mother s soul unclouded shine    maria           can i be like to her  i only knew her faded  white  and grave  and so she still floats vaguely through my dreams  with eyes like your own angels   and a brow worthy an aureole    ribera           an earthly crown  my princess  might more fitly rest on thine  annicca hath her colors  blue black hair  and pale  brown flesh  and gray  untroubled eyes  yet thou more often bring st her to mind  for all the tawny gold of thy thick locks  thy rare white face  and brilliant spanish orbs  thine is her lisping trick of voice  her laugh  the blithest music still this side of heaven  thine her free  springing gait  though therewithal a swaying  languid motion all thine own  recalls valencia more than italy  like and unlike thou art to her  as still my memory loves to hold her  as she first beamed like the star of morning on my life  hot  faint  and footsore  i had paced since dawn the sun baked streets of naples  seeking work  not alms  despite the beggar that i looked  now  t was nigh vespers  and my suit had met with curt refusal  sharp rebuff  and gibes  praised be the saints  for every drop of gall in that day s brimming cup  i have upheld a poisoned beaker to another s lips  many a one hath the ribera taught to fare a vagabond through alien streets  a god unrecognized  midst churls and clowns  with kindled soul aflame  and body faint or lack of bread   domenichino knows  and gessi  guido  annibal caracci     maria  dear father  calm yourself   you had begun to tell me how you saw my mother first    ribera  true  i forgot it not   why  i am calm  the old man now can well be grave and cold  or laugh at his own youth s indignities  past a long lifetime back    t was vespers  hour  or nigh it  when i reached her father s door  kind was his greeting  the first cordial words i heard in naples  but i took small heed of speech or toe  for all my sense was rapt in wonder at the angel by his side who smiled upon me   large  clear eyes that held the very soul of sunlight in their depths  low  pure  pale brow  with masses of black hair flung loosely back  and rippling unconfined in shadowy magnificence below the slim gold girdle o er the snow soft gown  vested and draped about her throat and waist and wrists  a stately lily ere the dew of morn hath passed away  such was thy mother  child    maria  would i were like her   but what said she  father  how did she plead for you    ribera           ah  cunning child  i see thy tricks  thou humorest my age  knowing how much i love to tell this tale  though thou hast heard it half a hundred times    maria  i find it sweet to hear as you to tell  believe me  father    ribera            t was to pleasure her  signor cortese gave me all i lacked to prove my unfamed skill   a savage pride  matched oddly with my rags  the haughtiness wherewith i claimed rather than begged my tools  and my quaint aspect  oft she told me since  won at a glance her faith   before i left  she guessed my need  and served me meat and wine with  her own flower white hands   the parting grace i craved was granted  that my work might be the portrait of herself   thou knowest the rest    maria  why did she leave us  father   oh  how oft i yearn to see her face  to hear her voice  hushed in an endless silence   strange that she  whose rich love beggared our return  should bear such separation   though engirdled now by heavenly hosts of saints and seraphim  i cannot fancy it   what  shall her child  whose lightest sigh reechoed in her heart  have need of her and cry to her in vain    ribera  now  for god s sake  maria  speak not thus  let me not see such tears upon thy cheek  not unto us it has been given to guess the peace of disembodied souls like hers  the vanishing glimpses that my fancies catch through heaven s half opened gates  exalt even me  poor sinner that i am   and what are these  the painted shadows that make all my life a glory  to the splendor of that light  for thee  my child  has not my doting love sufficed  at least in part  to fill the breach of that tremendous void   what dost thou lack  what help  what counsel  what most dear caress  what dost thou covet   what least whim remains ungratified  because not yet expressed    maria  none  none  dear father   pardon me   thy love  generous and wise as tender  shames my power to merit or repay   fie o my lips  look if they be not blistered   let them smooth with contrite kisses the last frown away  we must be young to night  no wrinkles then  genius must show immortal as she is    ribera  thou wilt unman me with thy pretty ways  i had forgot the ball   yea  i grow old  this scanty morning s work has wearied me  once i had thought it play to dream all day before my canvas and then dance till dawn  and now must i give o er and rest at noon   rises      enter luca  ushering in lorenzo  who carries a portfolio    luca  signor lorenzo   lorenzo ceremoniously salutes ribera and maria   exit luca     lorenzo           master  i bring my sketch   opens his portfolio and hands a sketch to ribera     ribera  humph  the design is not so ill conceived  i note some progress  but your drawing s bad   yes  bad  sir   mark you how this leg hangs limp  as though devoid of life  these hands seem clenched  not loosely clasped  as you intended them   he takes his pencil and makes a few strokes  thus should it stand  a single line will mend  and here  what s this   why   t is a sloven s work  you dance too many nights away  young gallant  you shirk close labor as do all your mates  you think to win with service frivolous  snatched  twixt your cups  or set between two kisses  the favor of the mistress of the world    lorenzo  your pardon  master  but you do me wrong  mayhap i lack the gift   alas  i fear it  but not the patience  not the energy of earnest  indefatigable toil  that help to make the artist    ribera            s death   he dares belie me  and deny the testimony of his own handiwork  whose every line betrays a sluggard soul  an indolent will  a brain that s bred to idleness   so be it  master lorenzo tells the spagnoletto his own defects and qualities    t were best he find another teacher competent to guide so apt  so diligent a scholar    maria  dear father  what hath given thee offence  cast but another glance upon the sketch  surely it hath some grace  some charm  some promise    ribera  daughter  stand by   i know these insolent slips of young nobility  they lack the stuff that makes us artists   what  to answer me  when next i drop a hint as to his colors  the lengthening or the shortening of a stroke  he ll bandy words with me about his error  to prove himself the master    lorenzo           if my defect be an hereditary grain i  the blood  even as you say  i must abide by it  but if patrician habits more than birth beget such faults  then may i dare to hope  not mine  i knew  i felt  to clear new paths  to win new kingdoms  yet were i content with such achievement as a strenuous will  a firm endeavor  unfaltering love  and an unwearying spirit might attain  cast me not lightly back   banish me not from this  my home of hope  of inspiration    maria  what  my ungentle father   will you hear  and leave this worthy signor s suit unanswered    ribera  well  he may bide   sir  i will speak with you anon upon this work   i judged in haste  yea  it hath merit   i am weary now  to morrow i shall be in fitter mood to give you certain hints   lorenzo bows his thanks and advances to address maria   ribera silences and dismisses him with a wave of the hand   exit lorenzo     ribera           should i o ersleep mine hour  maria  thou must awaken me  but come what may  i will be fresh to night  to triumph in thy triumph   exit ribera     maria  alone            could i have told  then when he bade me   nay  what is to tell  he had flouted me for prizing at such height homage so slight from john of austria  even  a glance exchanged  a smile  a fallen flower dropped from my hair  and pressed against his lips  the prince  my father gloats upon that name  were he no more than gentleman  i think i should be glad   i cannot tell to day if i be sad or gay   now could i weep warm  longing tears  anon  a fire of joy leaps in my heart and dances through my veins  why should i nurse such idle thoughts   tonight we are to meet again   will he remember    nay  how should he forget   his heart is young  his eyes do mirror loyalty   oh  day  quicken thy dull  slow round of tedious hours  god make me beautiful this happy night  my father s sleeping saint rebukes my thought  strange he has left his work  against his wont  revealed before completed   i will draw the curtain   she stands irresolute before the picture with her hand on the curtain            beautiful  oh  beautiful  the far  bright  opened heavens  the dark earth  where the tranced pilgrim lies  with eyelids sealed  his calm face flushed with comfortable sleep  his weary limbs relaxed  his heavy head pillowed upon the stone   oh  blessed dream that visits his rapt sense  of airy forms  mounting  descending on the shining ladder  with messages of peace   i will be true unto my lineage divine  and breathe the passion of just pride that overfills his soul inspired     while she stands before the canvas  reenter  unperceived by   her  lorenzo    lorenzo           oh  celestial vision  what brush may reproduce those magic tints  those lines ethereal      maria  turns suddenly            is it not marvellous  signor lorenzo   i would draw the curtain  but  gazing  i forgot           you are the first  after the master and myself  to look upon this wonder    lorenzo  with enthusiasm  looking for he first time at the picture            ah  what an answer this for envious minds that would restrict his power to writhing limbs and shrivelled flesh   repose  beauty  and large simplicity are here  yes  that is art   before such work i stand and feel myself a dwarf    maria           there  you are wrong  my father even  who knows his proper worth  before his best achievements i have seen in like dejection   t is the curse of genius  oft have i heard the master grace your name with flattering addition    lorenzo            t is your goodness  and not the echo of his praise  that speaks  my work was worthless   t was your generous voice alone secured the master s second glance    maria  nay  signor  frankly  he esteems your talent  because you are of well assured means and gentle birth  he will be rude to you  not without base is the deep grudge he owes to riches and prosperity    lorenzo           signora  why do i bear such harsh  injurious terms as he affronts me with   why must i seem in mine own eyes a craven   spiritless  dishonorably patient    t is not his fame  his power  his gift  his venerable years that bind me here his willing slave   maria   t is thou   t is thou alone   t is that i love thee  and exile hence is death   a pause   he kneels at her feet   she looks at him kindly but makes no reply            at thy dear feet i lay my life with its most loyal service  the subject of thy pleasure    maria  tenderly            you are too humble    lorenzo  too humble   do you seek mine utter ruin  with words whose very tone is a caress  i say all   i love you   you have known it  why should i tell you   yet  to day you seem other than you have been   a milder light beams from your eyes  a gentler grace is throned upon your brow  your words fall soft as dew to melt my fixed resolve    maria           you find me  signor  in an unguarded mood   i would be true to you  and to myself  yet  know no answer  anon  i will be calm  pray you withdraw    lorenzo  till when   remember what mad hopes and fears meantime will riot in my brain    maria           to morrow   farewell  farewell    lorenzo  kisses her hand            farewell   exit     maria           a faithful heart  a name untainted  a fair home  yea  these are what i need   oh  lily soul in heaven  who wast on earth my mother  guide thy child     while maria sits rapt in thought  enter from behind her  annicca    who bends over her and kisses her brow    annicca  what  sister  lost in dreams by daylight   fie  who is the monarch of thy thoughts    maria  starting            annicca  my thoughts are bounden to no master yet  they fly from earth to heaven in a breath  now are they all of earth   hast heard the tidings    annicca  yea  of the prince s ball   we go together  braid in thy hair our mother s pearls  and wear the amulet ingemmed with eastern stones   t will bring good fortune    maria           tell me  ere we go  what manner of man is john of austria    annicca  scarce man at all  a madcap  charming boy  well favored  you have seen him  exquisite in courtly compliment  of simple manners  you may not hear a merrier laugh than his from any boatman on the bay  well versed in all such arts as most become his station  light in the dance as winged foot mercury  eloquent on the zither  and a master of rapier and     maria           a puppet could be made to answer in all points your praise of him  hath he no substance as of a man    annicca           why  sister  what may that be to us    maria           he is our prince    annicca  the promise of his youth is to outstrip the hero of lepanto  bright and bold as fire  he is the very soul  the star of spanish chivalry  his last achievement seems still the flower of his accomplishments  musician  soldier  courtier  yea  and artist   he had been a painter  were he not a prince   says messer zurbaran   the calderona  his actress mother  hath bequeathed to him her spirit with her beauty  and the power to win and hold men s hearts    maria           i knew it  sister  his eye hath a command in it  his brow seems garlanded with laurel    annicca           what is this  you kindle with his praise  your whole heart glows in light and color on your face  your words take wing and fly as bold as reckless birds  what  can so rash a thought  a dream so wild  so hopeless an ambition  tempt your soul    maria  pray you  what thought  what dream  and what ambition  i knew not i had uttered any such    annicca  nor have you in your speech  your eyes now veiled  where the light leaped to hear me voice his fame  your blushes and your pallor have betrayed that which should lie uncounted fathom deep   the secret of a woman s foolish heart    maria  and there it lies  my sibyl sister  still  your plummet hath not reached it   yes   t is love flaunts his triumphant colors in my cheek  and quickens my lame speech  but not for him  not for the prince  so may i vaunt his worth with a free soul    annicca           say on    maria           a gentleman  favored of earth and heaven  true and loving  hath cast his heart at my imperial feet  and if to morrow find me as to day  i will e en stoop and raise it to mine own    annicca  signor vitruvio    maria           not he  indeed  did not i say favored of earth and heaven  that should mean other gifts than bags of gold  or a straight featured mask   nor will it be any you name  though you should name him right  must it not lie  how many fathom deep   the secret of a woman s foolish heart    annicca  kiss me  maria   you are still a child  you cannot vex me  wilful as you be  your choice  i fear not  doubtless  t will prove wise  despite your wild wit  for your heart is pure  and you will pause with sure deliberate judgment before you leave our father    maria           does love steal so gently o er our soul   what if he come a cloud  a fire  a whirlwind  to o erbear the feeble barriers wherewith we oppose him  and blind our eyes and wrest from us our reason  fear not  annicca  for in no such guise he visits my calm breast  but yet you speak somewhat too sagely   did such cautious wisdom guide your own fancy    annicca           jest no more  maria  since i became a wife  is much made clear  which a brief year ago was dark and vague  tommaso loves me  we are happier then i had dreamed  yet matching now with then  i see his love is not that large  rich passion our father bore us    maria           you regret your home    annicca  no  no   i have no wish and no regret  i speak for you   his is a sovereign soul  and all his passions loom in huger shape than lesser men s   he brooks no rivalry with his own offspring  and toward me his love hath ebbed  i mark  to a more even flow  while deeper  stronger  sets the powerful current toward you alone   consider this  maria  nor wantonly discrown that sacred head of your young love to wreathe some curled boy s brow    maria  think you his wish were that i should not wed    annicca  nay  that i say not  for his pride aspires to see you nobly mated    maria  after a pause            him will i wed whose name is ancient  fair  and honorable  as the ribera s is illustrious   him who no less than i will venerate that white  divine old head   in art his pupil  in love his son  tender as i to watch  and to delay the slow extinguishing of that great light    annicca           there spake his darling child    maria  what is t o clock   if he should sleep too late   he bade me rouse him     annicca           haste to seek him  then   t is hard on sunset  and he looks for thee with his first waking motion   till to night   exeunt severally      scene ii     a hall in ribera s house   enter luca and fiametta    fiametta  but did you see her    luca  nay  i saw her sister  donna annicca    fiametta  tush  man  never name her beside my lady maria rosa   you have lost the richest feast in the world for hungry eyes   her gown of cloth o  silver clad her  as it were  with light  there twinkled about her waist a girdle stiff with stones  you would have said they breathed   mine own hands wreathed the dropping pearls in her hair  and pearls again were clasped around her throat   but no  i might tell thee every ornament  her jeweled fan  her comb of pearls  her floating veil of gauze  and still the best of all would escape us    luca  thou speakest more like her page than her handmaiden    fiametta  thou knowest not woman truly  for all thy wit   i speak most like a woman when i weigh the worth of beauty and rich apparel   heigh ho  i have felt the need of this   thou  good luca  who might have been my father  canst understand me   he was poor as thou   why shouldst thou be his lackey  his slave   my hand were as dainty as hers  if it could but be spared its daily labor    luca  yes  poor child  i understand thee  and yet thou art wrong   he is more slave to pride than i am to him   i know him well  fiametta   after so many years of service  and to day i pity him more than i fear him   why  girl  my task is sport beside his toil   if my limbs be weary  i sleep  but i have seen him sit before his canvas with straining eyes and the big beads standing on his brow   when at last he gave o er  and i have smoothed his pillow  and served and soothed him  what sleep could he snatch   his brain is haunted with evil visions  whereof some be merely of his own imaginings  and others the phantoms of folk who are living or have lived  and who rouse his jealousy or mayhap his remorse  god only knows   if that be genius  to be alive to pain at every pore  to be possessed of a devil that robs you of your sleep and grants no space between the hours of grinding toil  i thank the saints i am a simple man    fiametta  i grant thee thou mayst be right concerning him  he hath indeed a  strange  sour mien   i shudder when he turns suddenly  as his wont is  and bends his evil eyes on me   the holy father tells me such warnings come from god   no matter how slight the service he asks of me  my flesh creeps and my limbs refuse to move  till i have whispered an ave   but what of lady maria rosa   both heaven and earth smile upon her   to night she wears a poor girl s dowry  a separate fortune  on her head  her neck  her hands  yes  on her little jeweled feet   one tiny shoe of hers would make me free to wed my lad    luca  if he have but eyes  i warrant thee he finds jewels enough in thy bright face   tell me his name    fiametta  nay  that is my secret    luca  he must be a poor souled lad if he will wait till thou hast earned a dowry    fiametta  a poor souled lad  my good vicenzo  ah  but no matter  thou knowest him  luca  my lord lorenzo s page   there   is he poor  or mean  or plain  or dull   he claims no dowry  he  but i have my pride  as well as the great ones    luca  may the saints preserve thee from such as theirs   i am heartily glad of thy good fortune   i am not sure whether thou or lady marie rosa be the most favored   well  the end proves all   exeunt      enter on one side annicca and don tommaso  attired for the ball    on the other side  ribera

i have some treasure still   i do repent so heartily of my discourteous speech  that i will crave your leave before i kiss your wife s soft palm    annicca  kissing him repeatedly            why  father  what is this  can don tommaso s wife so soon forget she is the spagnoletto s child    ribera           enough  i can bear praise  thou knowest  from all save thee and my maria   my grave son  i fear  will mock these transports   pray go in with me  no one of us but has this night a triumph  let us make ready   exeunt      act ii   scene i     ball in the palace of don john   dance   don john and maria   together  don tommaso  annicca   lords and ladies  dancing or   promenading    1st lord  were it not better to withdraw awhile  after our dance  unto the torch lit gardens  the air is fresh and sweet without    1st lady           nay  signor  i like this heavy air  rich with warm odors  the broad  clear light  the many colored throng  i might have breathed on mine own balcony the evening breeze    1st lord           still at cross purposes  when will you cease to flout me    1st lady           when i prize a lover s sigh more dear than mine own pleasure  see  the signora julia passed again  she is far too pale for so much white  i find  donna aurora  ah  how beautiful  that spreading ruff  sprinkled with seeds of gold  becomes her well   would you believe it  sir  folk say her face is twin to mine  what think you    1st lord  for me  the huge earth holds but one such face  you know it well    1st lady           the hall is overfilled  go we without   they pass on     2d lady           thrice he hath danced with her  she is not one of us  her face is strange  colored and carven to meet most men s desire   is t not  my lord   certes  it loses naught for lack of ornament   pray  ask her name  if but for my sake    2d lord           i have already asked  she is the daughter to the spagnoletto  maria rosa    2d lady           ah  i might have guessed  the form and face are matched with the apparel  as in a picture    t was the master s hand  i warrant you  arranged with such quaint art  such seeming careless care  the dead  white pearls within her odd  bright hair   they pass on     don john            now hope  now fear reigned lord of my wild dreams   one name still sang like the repeated strain of some caged bird  its sweet  persistent music through my brain  one vanishing face upon the empty air shone forth and faded night and day   and you  did you not find me hasty  over bold  nay  tell me all your thought    maria           you know  my lord  i am no courtier  and belike my thought might prove too rustic for a royal ear    don john           speak on  speak on  though you should rail  your voice would still outsing rebeck and mandoline    maria           is it not strange  i knew you not  albeit i might have guessed  if only from the simple garb of black  and golden collar   midst the motley hues of our gay nobles   i know not what besides  but this first won me   be not angered  sir  but  as i looked  i never ranked you higher than simple gentleman   i asked your name  then  when you highness stooped to pick my flower  my lord  that moment was my thought a traitor  for it had fain discrowned you    don john           may god s angels reward such treason   say me those words again  let the rich blush born of that dear confession again dye cheek and brow  and fade and melt forever  even as then    maria  we are watched  my lord  this is no place  no hour  for words like these    don john  when  where then  may we meet   they pass on      scene ii     the palace gardens   interrupted sounds of music and revelry   come though the open windows of the ball room  seen in the   background   ribera  pacing the stage  occasionally pausing   to look in upon the dancers    ribera  this is revenge   is she not beautiful  ye gods   the beggar s child matched with a prince  throb not so high  my heart   neath envious eyes fixed on thy triumph   now am i well repaid for my slow  martyred years   was i not wrung by keener tortures than my savage brush  though dipped in my heart s blood  might reproduce  no twisted muscle  no contorted limb  no agony of flesh  have i yet drawn  that owed not its suggestion to some pang of my  pride crucified  my spirit racked  my entrails gnawed by the blind worm of hate  engendered of oppression   that is past  but not forgotten  though to night i please to yield to gentler influence  to own the strength of beauty and the power of joy  and welcome gracious phantasies that throng and hover over me in airy shapes  the spirits of earth and heaven contend to night for mastery within me  ne er before have i been more the spagnoletto  fired with noble wrath  with the consuming fever and fierce delight of vengeance           from this point i see her clearly  the auroral face a light with smiles  the imperial head upraised  her languid hand sways the broad  silken fan  whose wing like movement stirs above her brow the fine  bright curls  as though warm airs of heaven around her breathed   he leads her  midst the throng  so  they have gone  but i will follow them  and watch them from afar   exit      enter from the opposite side don john and maria    don john           i dread to ask what quivers on my lips   my heart is free  but thine    maria  my heart is free  my lord    don john           thank god    maria  it never beat less calmly at the sound of any voice till now   i laugh to think this very morn i fancied it had met its master    don john           ah    maria           fear naught  a simple boy  a pupil of my father s    don john           i was mad to dream it could be otherwise   forgive me  i  a mere stranger in they life  am jealous of all thy present and thy past    maria           listen  my lord  you shall hear all   what hour  think you  he chose to urge his cause   the same wherein i learned your highness had commanded for to night our presence   my winged thoughts were flying back to count lodovico s  again i saw you  my white rose at your lips  your grave eyes fixed most frankly  yet most reverently  on mine  again my heart sank as i heard the name  the prince of austria  and while i mused  he spake of love   oh  i am much to blame  my mood was soft   although i promised naught  i listened  yea  i listened   good  my lord  do you not pity him    don john           thanks  and thanks again  for thy confession   now no spot remains on the unblemished mirror of my faith  since that dear night  i with one only thought have gained the sum of knowledge and opinions touching thine honored father  with such scraps as the gross public voice could dole to me concerning thine own far removed  white life  thou art  i learn  immured in close seclusion  thy father  be it with all reverence said  hedges with jealous barriers his treasure  whilst thou  most duteous  tenderest of daughters  breath st but for him    maria           dear father   were it so   t were simple justice   ah  if you knew him   a proud  large  tameless heart   this is the cloister where he immures me  naples  gayest revels  the only bar wherewith he hedges me is his unbounded trust  that leaves me free  let us go in  the late night air is chill    don john  yet one more dance    maria     you may command  my lord   exeunt      enter ribera    ribera  i lost them in the press   ah  there they dance again together   i would lay my hands in blessing on that darling  haughty head  like the ribera s child  she bears her honors as lightly as a flower   yet there glows unwonted lustre in her starry eyes  and richer beauty blushes on her cheek  enough   now must i strive to fix that form that haunts my brain  the blind  old count camillo  the prince s oracle   midst the thick throng my fancy singled him  white beard  white hair  sealed eyes  and brow lit by an inward light  so will i paint mine isaac blessing esau  while jacob kneels before him  blind  betrayed by his own flesh     as ribera stands aside  lost in thought  enter don john and maria    maria           see the impatient day wakes in the east    don john           one moment here  signora  breathe we the charm of this enchanted night  look where behind yon vines the slow moon sets  hidden from us  while every leaf hangs black  each tender stalk distinct  each curling edge against the silver sky    maria  perceiving ribera            what  father  here    ribera  maria   ah  my prince  i crave your pardon  when thus i muse   t is but my mind that lives  each outward sense is dead   i saw you not  i heard nor voice nor footstep   yonder lines that streak the brightening sky east warn us away  for all your grace to us  the spagnoletto proffers his thanks to john of austria  my daughter  art thou ready    don john           i am bound  illustrious signor  rather unto you and the signora  past all hope of payment  when may i come to tender my poor homage to the sicilian master    ribera           my lord will jest  our house is too much honored when he deigns o erstep the threshold   let your royal pleasure alone decide the hour    don john           to morrow  then  or i should say to day  for dawn is nigh    ribera  and still we trespass   be it as you will  we are your servants    maria            so  my lord  good night   exeunt maria and ribera     don john  alone   gods  what a haughty devil rules that man  as though two equal princes interchanged imperial courtesies   the spagnoletto thanks john of austria   louis of france might so salute may father   by heaven  i know not what patience or what reverence withheld my enchafed spirit in bounds of courtesy  nay  it was she  mine angel  whose mere aspect is balm and blessing   how her love lit eyes burned through my soul   how her soft hand s slight pressure tingled along my veins   oh  she is worthy a heart  religion   how shall i wear the hours ere i may seek her   lo  i stand and dream  while my late guests await me   patience  patience   exeunt      scene iii     morning twilight in ribera s garden   during this scene the day   gradually breaks  and at the close the full light of morning   illuminates the stage   lorenzo    aubade    lorenzo  sings     from thy poppied sleep awake      from they golden dreams arise    earth and seas new colors take      love light dawns in rosy skies  weird night s fantastic shadows are outworn  why tarriest thou  oh  sister to the morn      hearken  love  the matin choir     of birds salutes thee  and with these   blends the voice of my desire      unto no richer promises of deeper  dearer  holier love than mine  canst thou awaken from they dreams divine      lo  thine eastern windows flame      brightening with the brightened sky    rise  and with thy beauty shame     morning s regal pageantry  to thrill and bless as the reviving sun  for my heart gropes in doubt  though night be gone     he speaks   why should i fear   her soul is pledged to mine  albeit she still withheld the binding word  how long hath been the night  but morn breathes hope   i fain were true to you and to myself    did she say thus  or is my fevered brain the fool of its desires   the world swam  the blood rang beating in mine ears and roared like rushing waters  yet  as through a dream  i saw her dimly   surely on her lids shone the clear tears   as there s a god in heaven  she spake those words   my lips retain the touch of those soft  snow cold hands  neither refused nor proffered   such things are  nor can they be forgotten or foreknown   yes  she is mine  but soft   her casement opes   oh  joy   t is she  pale  in a cloud of white she stands and drinks the morning sunlight    maria  above at the window            ah  how sweet this air kisses my sleepless lids and burning temples  i am not weary  though i found no rest  my spirit leaps within me  a new glory blesses the dear  familiar scene  ripe orchard  the same  yet oh  how different   even i thought soft music trembled on the listening air  as though a harp were touched  blent with low song  sure  that was phantasy   i will descend  visit my flowers  and see whereon the dew hangs heaviest  and what fairest bud hath bloomed since yester eve   why should i court repose and dull forgetfulness  while the large earth wakes no lesser joy than mine   exit from above     lorenzo           oh  heart  how may my breast contain thee  with thy burden of too much happiness     enter maria below  lorenzo springs forward to greet her  she   shrinks back in a sort of terror    lorenzo           good day  sweet mistress  may the blithe spirit of this auspicious morn become the genius of thy days to come  whereof be none less beautiful than this  why art thou silent   does not love inspire joyous expression  be it but a sigh  a song  a smile  a broken word  a cry  thou hast not granted me the promised pledge for which i hunger still   i would confirm with dear avowals  frequent seals of love  that which  though sure  i yet can scarce believe    maria  somewhat too sure  i think  my lord lorenzo  i scarce deemed possible that one so shy but yester morn should hold so high a mien  claiming what ne er was given    lorenzo           maria    maria           sir  you are a trifle bold to speak my name familiarly as no man  save my father or my own brother  dares    lorenzo           ah  now i see your jest   you will not seem so lightly won without a wooing   you will feign disdain  only to make more sweet your rich concession  too late  i heard it all    a new light shines on the familiar scene    what may that be  save the strange splendor of the dawn of love  nay  darling  cease to jest  lest my poor heart  hanging  twixt hell and heaven  in earnest break    maria  here is no jest  sir  but a fatal error  crying for swift correction   you surprise me with rude impatience  ere i have found time to con a gentle answer   pardon me if any phrase or word or glance of mine hath bred or nourished in your heart a hope that you might win my love   it cannot be    lorenzo  a word  a glance   why  the whole frozen statue warmed into life   surely it was not you  you must have bribed some angel with false prayers to wear your semblance  nay  no angel served  but devilish witchcraft     maria           sir  enough  enough  i hoped to find here peace and solitude  these lacking  i retire   farewell   going toward the house     lorenzo           signora  i will not rob you of your own   farewell to you   exit     maria  where have you flown  bright dreams   has that rude hand sufficed to dash to naught your frail creations  sad thoughts and humors black now fill my soul  so his rough foot hath bruised the dewy grass  and left it sere   why should his harsh words touch me  the truth of yesterday is false to day  how could i know  dear god   how might i guess the bitter sweetness  the delicious pain  a new heart fills my breast  as soft and weak and melting as a tear  unto its lord  but kindled with quick courage to endure  if i need front for him  a world of foes  if this be love  ah  what a hell is theirs who suffer without hope   even i  who hold so many dear assurances  who hear still ringing in mine ears such sacred vows  am haunted with an unaccustomed doubt  not wonted to go hand in hand with joy  a gloomy omen greets me with the morn  i  who recoil from pain  must strike and wound  what may this mean   help me  ye saints of heaven and holy mother  for my strength is naught     she falls on her knees and bursts into tears   reenter lorenzo    lorenzo  aside   thank heaven  i came   how have i wrung her soul  a noble love  forsooth  a blind  brute passion  that being denied  is swift transformed to hate no whit more cruel    to maria    lady    maria  rising hastily            signor lorenzo  again what would you with me    lorenzo           no such suit as late i proffered  but your gracious pardon    maria  rise  sir  forgiven   i  too  have been to blame  although less deeply than you deemed   forbear to bind your life   i feel myself unworthy of that high station where your thoughts enthrone me  yet i dare call myself your friend   offering him her hand  which lorenzo presses to his lips     lorenzo           thanks  thanks  be blessed  and farewell   exit      enter ribera  calling    ribera           daughter  maria    maria  why  father  i am here  kissing him    good day   what will you    ribera  darling  no more than what i always will  before i enter mine own world removed  i fain would greet the dearest work of god  i missed you when i rose   i sought you first in your own chamber  where the lattice  oped  let in the morning splendor and smells of the moist garden  with the sound of voices  i looked  i found you here  but not alone  what man was that went from you    maria           your disciple  my lord lorenzo   you remember  father  how yester morn i pleaded for his work  thus he  through gratitude and  love  hath watched all night within our garden  while i danced  and when i came to nurse my flowers  he spake    ribera  and you    maria           am i not still beside you  father  i will not leave you    ribera           ah  mine angel child  i cannot choose but dread it  though i wait expectant of the hour when you fulfil your woman s destiny   you have full freedom  yet i rejoice at this reprieve  and thank thee for thy brave truthfulness   be ever thus  withholding naught from him whose heart reflects only thine image   thou art still my pride  even as last night when all eyes gazed thy way  thy bearing equal in disdainful grace to his who courted thee  thy sovereign s son    maria  yea  so   and yet it was not pride i felt  nor consciousness of self  nor vain delight in the world s envy   something more than these  far deeper  sweeter  what have i said   my brain is dull with sleep    t is only now i feel the weariness of so much pleasure    ribera  rising            well  go we within   yes  i am late to work  we squander precious moments   thou  go rest  and waken with fresh roses in they cheeks  to greet our royal guest   exeunt      act iii   scene i     the studio of the spagnoletto   ribera before his canvas   luca   in attendance    ribera  laying aside his brush   so  i am weary   luca  what  s o clock    luca  my lord  an hour past noon    ribera           so late already  well  one more morning of such delicate toil will make it ready for madrid  and worthy not merely philip s eyes  but theirs whose glance outvalues a king s gaze  my noble friend velasquez  and the monkish zurbaran  luca    luca     my lord    ribera           hath the signora risen    luca  fiametta passed a brief while since  and left my lady sleeping    ribera           good  she hath found rest  poor child  she sadly lacked it   she had known  twixt dawn and dawn no respite from emotion  her chill hand fluttered like a bird in mine  her soft brow burned my lips   could that boy read the tokens of an overwearied spirit  strained past endurance  he had spared her still  at any cost of silence   what is such love to mine  that would outrival roman heroes   watch mine arm crisp and shrivel in quick flame  or set a lynx to gnaw my heart away  to save her from a needle prick of pain  ay  or to please her   at their worth she rates her wooers  light as all embracing air or universal sunshine   luca  go and tell fiametta  rather  bid the lass hither herself   exit luca            he comes to pay me homage  as would his royal father  if he pleased to visit naples  yet she too shall see him  she is part of all i think  of all i am  she is myself  no less than yon bright dream fixed in immortal beauty on the canvas     enter fiametta    fiametta  my lord  you called me    ribera           when thy mistress wakes  array her richly  that she be prepared to come before the prince    fiametta           sir  she hath risen  and only waits me with your lordship s leave  to cross the street unto st  francis  church    ribera  musingly   with such slight escort   nay  this troubles me  only the strada s width   the saints forbid that i should thwart her holy exercise  myself will go   i cannot   bid her muffle  like our valencian ladies  her silk mantle about her face and head   at a sign from ribera  exit fiametta            yes  god will bless her  what should i fear   i will make sure her beauty is duly masked   he goes toward the casement            ay  there she goes  the mantle  draped round the stately head  discloses naught save the live jewel of the eye   unless one guessed from the majestic grace and proud proportions  she might so pass through the high thoroughfares  ah  one thick curl escapes from its black prison  alone in naples  wreathed with rays of gold  her crown of light betrays her   so  she s safe     enter luca    luca  a noble gentleman of spain awaits the master s leave to enter    ribera          show him in   exit luca   ribera draws the curtain before his picture of  jacob s dream      ribera  a gentleman of spain   perchance the prince sends couriers to herald his approach  or craves a longer grace     enter luca  ushering in don john unattended  completely enveloped   in a spanish mantle  which he throws off  his face almost hidden   by a cavalier s hat   he uncovers his head on entering   ribera    repressing a movement of surprise  hastens to greet him and kisses   his hand    ribera           welcome  my lord  i am shamed to think my sovereign s son should wait  through a churl s ignorance  without my doors    don john  dear master  blame him not   i came attended by one page only   here i blush to claim such honor as depends on outward pomp  no royalty is here  save the crowned monarch of our sicilian artists   be it mine to press with reverent lips my master s hand    ribera  your highness is too gracious  if you glance round mine ill furnished studio  my works shall best proclaim me and my poor deserts  luca  uplift you hangings    don john  seating himself            sir  you may sit    ribera  aside  seating himself slowly   curse his swollen arrogance   doth he imagine i waited leave of him   luca uncovers the picture     don john           oh  wonderful  you have bettered here your best   why  sir  he breathes  will not those locked lids ope   that nerveless hand regain the iron strength of sinew mated with such heroic frame   you have conspired with nature to produce a man   behold  i chatter foolish speech  for such a marvel the fittest praise is silence   he rises and stands before the picture     ribera  after a pause            i am glad your highness deigns approve   lose no more time  lest the poor details should repay you not  unto your royal home  t will follow you  companion  though unworthy  to the treasures of the queen s gallery    don john            t is another jewel set in my father s crown  and  in his name  i thank you for it   ribera bows silently   don john glances around the studio     don john           there hangs a quaint  strong head  though merely sketched   what a marked  cunning leer grins on the wide mouth  what a bestial glance    ribera   t is but a slight hint for my larger work   bacchus made drunk by satyrs     don john           where is that  i ne er have seen the painting    ribera            t is not in oils  but etched in aqua fortis   luca  fetch down yonder portfolio   i can show your highness the graven copy   luca brings forward a large portfolio   ribera looks hastily over the engravings and draws one out which he shows to don john     don john           ah  most admirable  i know not who is best portrayed  the god  plump  reeling  wreathed with vine  in whom abides something olympian still  or the coarse satyrs  thoroughly brutish   here i scarcely miss  so masterly the grouping  so distinct the bacchanalian spirit  your rich brush  so vigorous in color   do you find the pleasure in this treatment equals that of the oil painting    ribera           all is in my mood  we have so many petty talents  clever to mimic nature s surface   i name not the servile copyists of the greater masters  or of th  archangels  raphael and michael  but such as paint our cheap and daily marvels  sometimes i fear lest they degrade our art to a nice craft for plodding artisans   mere realism  which they mistake for truth  my soul rejects such limits   the true artist gives nature s best effects with far less means  plain black and white suffice him to express a finer grace  a stronger energy than she attains with all the aid of color  i argue thus and work with simple tools  like the greek fathers of our art  the sculptors  who wrought in white alone their matchless types  then dazzled by the living bloom of earth  glowing with color  i return to that  my earliest worship  and compose such work as you see there   pointing to the picture     don john           would it be overmuch  in my brief stay in naples  to beg of you a portrait of myself in aqua fortis   t would rob you  sir  of fewer golden hours than the full colored canvas  and enrich with a new treasure our royal gallery    ribera  you may command my hours and all that s mine    don john  rising   thanks  generous master   when may i return for the first sitting    ribera           i am ready now   to day  to morrow  when your highness please    don john   t would be abuse of goodness to accept the present moment   i will come to morrow  at the same hour  in some more fitting garb  your hand  sir  and farewell   salute for me  i pray you  the signora   may i not hope to see and thank her for her grace to me  in so adorning my poor feast    ribera           the debt is ours  she may be here to morrow  she is free  she only  while i work  to come and go  pray  sir  allow her  she is never crossed  i stoop to beg for her  she is the last who bides with me  i crave you pardon  sir  what should this be to you    don john            t is much to me  whose privilege has been in this rare hour  beneath the master to discern the man  and thus add friendship unto admiration   he presses ribera s hand and is about to pick up his mantle and hat   luca springs forward  and  while he is throwing the cloak around the princes s shoulders  enter hastily maria   enveloped in her mantilla  as she went to church     maria  well  father  an i veiled and swathed to suit you  to cross the strada   she throws off her mantilla and appears all in white   she goes to embrace her father  when she suddenly perceives the prince  and stands speechless and blushing     ribera           child  his royal highness prince john of austria    don john           good day  signora  already twice my gracious stars have smiled  i saw you in the street   you wore your mantle  as the noon sun might wear a veil of cloud  covering  but not concealing    maria           i  sir  twice have unaware stood in your royal presence  you are welcome to my father s home and mine  i scarce need crave your pardon for my entrance  yourself must see how well assured i felt my father was alone    don john           and so you hoped to find him  shall i read your answer thus    ribera  nay  press her not   your highness does her wrong  so harshly to construe her simpleness  my daughter and myself are one  and both will own an equal pleasure if you bide    don john  seating himself   you chain me with kind words    maria           my father  sir  hath surely told you our delight and marvel at the enchantments of your feast   for me the night was brief  rich  beautiful  and strange as a bright dream    don john           i will gainsay you not  a beauteous soul can shed her proper glory on mean surroundings   i have likewise dreamed  nor am i yet awake   this morn hath been a feast for mind and eye   yon shepherd prince  whom angels visit in his sleep  shall crown your father s brow with a still fresher laurel  and link in equal fame the spanish artist with the lord s chosen prophet    ribera           that may be  for in the form of that wayfarer i drew myself   so have i slept beneath the naked heavens  pillowed by a stone  with no more shelter than the wind stirred branches  while the thick dews of our valencian nights drenched my rude weeds  and chilled through blood and bone  yet to me also were the heavens revealed  and angels visited my dreams    don john           how strange that you  dear masters  standing on the crown of a long life s continuous ascent  should backward glance unto such dark beginnings    ribera  obscure are all beginnings   yet i muse with pleasing pain on those fierce years of struggle  they were to me my birthright  all the vigor  the burning passion  the unflinching truth  my later pencil gained  i gleaned from them  i prized them   i reclaimed their ragged freedom  rather than hold my seat  a liveried slave  at the rich board of my lord cardinal  a palace was a prison till i reared mine own   but now my child s heart i would pierce sooner than see it bear the least of ills  such as i then endured    don john           donna maria may smile  sir  at your threat  she is in a pleasance  where no rude breezes blow  no shadow falls darker than that of cool and fragrant leaves  yea  were it otherwise  had you not reaped the fruit of your own works  she had not suffered  your children are spain s children    ribera           sir  that word is the most grateful you have spoken yet  why are thou silent  daughter    maria  absently            what should i say  the prince is kind   i scarcely heard your words  i listened to your voices  and i mused   don john  rising   i overstep your patience    maria           you will be gone  what have i said    ribera           you are a child  maria  to morrow i will wait your highness    don john           thanks  to morrow noon   farewell  signora   exit don john     ribera  what ails you  daughter   you forget yourself  your tongue cleaves to your mouth   you sit and muse  a statue of white silence   twice to day you have deeply vexed me   go not thus again across the street with that light child  fiametta  faith  you were closely muffled   what was this   this tell tale auburn curl that rippled down over the black mantilla   were i harsh  suspicious  jealous  fearful  prone to wrath  or anything of all that i am not  i should have deemed it no mere negligence  but a bold token    maria           father you make me quail  why do you threat me with such evil eyes  would they could read my heart    ribera           elude me not  whom have you met beside the prince this morn  who saw you pass   whom have you spoken with    maria  for god s sake  father  what strange thoughts are these  with none  with none   beside the prince  you say  why even him i saw not  as you know  i hastened with veiled eyes cast on the ground  swathed in my mantle still  i told my beads  and in like manner hasted home to you    ribera  well  it may pass  but henceforth say thy matins in thine own room   i know what vague cloud obscures my sight and weighs upon my brain  i am very weary  luca  follow me   exeunt ribera and luca     maria  poor father   dimly he perceives some trouble within the threatening air   thank heaven  i calmed him  yet i spake truth   what could have roused so soon his quick suspicion   did fiametta see the wary page slip in my hand the missive  as we came forth again   nay  even so  my father hath not spoken with her since  sure he knows naught   t is but my foolish fear makes monsters out of shadows   i may read the priceless lines and grave them on my heart   she draws from her bosom a letter  reads it  and presses it to her lips   he loves me  yes  he loves me   oh  my god  this awful joy in mine own breast is love  to night he will await me in our garden  oh  for a word  a pressure of the hand  i fly  my prince  at thy most dear behest   exit      scene ii     a room in don tommaso s house   don tommaso and annicca    don tommaso  truly  you wrong your sister  she is young  heedless  and wilful  that is all  a touch of the ribera s spirit fired the lass  don john was but her weapon of revenge against the malice of our haughty matrons  who hurled this icy shafts of scorn from heights of dignity upon the artist s daughter    annicca  i cannot think with you   in her demeanor  her kindled cheek  her melting eye  was more than sly revenge or cautious policy  if that was art  it overreached itself  ere the night ended  i had blushed to see slighting regards cast on my father s child  and hear her name and his tossed lightly round    don tommaso  could you not read in such disparagement the envy of small natures    annicca           i had as lief maria were to dance the tarantella upon the quay at noonday  as to see her gazed at again with such insulting homage    don tommaso  you are too strict  your baseless apprehensions wrong her far more than strangers  jests    annicca           not so  my timely fears prevent a greater ill and work no harm  since they shall be imparted only to him who hath the power to quell them  dissolving them to air  my father    don tommaso           how  you surely will not rouse his fatal wrath  annicca  listen  if your doubts were true  he whose fierce love guards her with sleepless eyes  more like the passion of some wild  dumb creature  with prowling jealousy and deadly spring  forth leaping at the first approach of ill  than the calm tenderness of human fathers  he surely had been keen to scent the danger  i saw him at the ball  as is his wont  he mingled not among the revellers  but like her shadow played the spy on her    annicca  a word would stir less deeply than you dread    don tommaso  ah  there you err  he knows no middle term  at once he would accept as fact the worst of your imaginings  his rage would smite all near him  and rebound upon himself  for  as i learn  don john brings royal orders for the queen s gallery  he would dismiss the prince as roughly as a begging artist  make no such breach just now betwixt the court and our own kindred    annicca           be it so  tommaso  i will do naught in haste    don tommaso           watch thou and wait  a slight reproof might now suffice the child  tame as a bird unto a gentle voice    annicca  my mind misgives me  yet will i find patience     scene iii     night in ribera s garden  don john alone    don john  in any less than she  so swift a passion  so unreserved  so reckless  had repelled  in her  t is godlike   our mutual love was born full grown  as we gazed each on each  nay   t was not born  but like a thing eternal  it was ere we had consciousness thereof  no growth of slow development  but perfect from the beginning  neither doomed to end  her garden breathes her own warm  southern beauty  glowing with dewy and voluptuous bloom  here i am happy  happy to dream and wait in rich security of bliss   i know how brief an interval divides us now  she hastes to meet me with no less impatience than mine to clasp her in my arms  to press heart unto heart  and see the love within the unfathomable depths of her great eyes  she comes   maria     enter maria  half timid  half joyous    maria           my lord  you have been waiting    don john  darling  not long   t was but my restless love that drove me here before the promised hour  so were i well content to wait through ages upon the threshold of a joy like this  knowing the gates of heaven might ope to me at any moment    maria           your love is less than mine  for i have counted every tedious minute since our last meeting    don john           i had rather speak less than the truth to have you chide me thus  yet if you enter in the lists with me  faith match with faith  and loyal heart with heart  i warrant you  the jealous god of love  who spies us from yon pomegranate bush  would crown me victor    maria           why should we compete  who could decide betwixt two equal truths  two perfect faiths    don john           the worship of my life will be slight payment for your boundless trust  look we nor forth nor back  are we not happy  heaven smiles above our heads with all her stars  the envious day forced us apart  the wing of obscure night protects and shelters us  now like a pure  night blooming flower  puts forth the perfect blossom of our love   oh  lean thy royal head upon my breast  assure me that this unheard of bliss is no fond dream  cling to me  darling  till thy love s dear burden take root about my heart strings    maria  after a pause            did you not hear a sound  a cry   oh  god  was it my father    don john  naught save the beating of our hearts i heard  be calm  my love  the very air is hushed  listen  the tinkle of the fountain yonder   the sleepy stir of leaves  the querulous pipe of some far bird  no more    maria           i heard  i heard  a rude voice called me   wherefore did it come to snatch me from that dream of restful love  oh  juan  you will save me  you will help    tell me you will  i have lost all for you    don john  to morrow you will laugh at fears like these  you have lost naught  you have but won my love  lose not your faith in that  your shield and weapon    maria  i tremble still in every limb   good night  i must be gone   to morrow when you come  be wary with my father  he is fierce in love and hatred   listen and look  my lord  if one dared say to me but yester morn that i would meet at night a stranger youth in mine own garden  talk with him of love  and hint a thought against the spagnoletto  i had smitten with this bauble such a one   pointing to a jewelled poniard in her belt   kiss me  my juan  once again   good night   exit maria      scene iv     the studio   ribera and annicca    annicca  has he come often    ribera           nay  i caught the trick of his fair face in some half dozen sittings  his is a bold and shapely head  it pleased me  i like the lad  the work upon his portrait was pastime   t is already nigh complete    annicca  and has maria sat here while you worked    ribera  sharply   why not   what would st thou say   speak  fret me not with ticklish fears   is she not by my side  for work or rest    annicca           surely  i meant no harm  father  how quick you are   i had but asked if she  being here  had seen the work progress  and found it his true counterpart    ribera           annicca  there is something in your thought you hold from me  have the lewd  prying eyes  the slanderous mind of public envy  spied herein some mischief  what hast thou heard   by heaven  if one foul word have darkened the fair fame of my white dove  naples shall rue it   let them not forget the chapel of saint januarius    annicca  aside   tommaso judged aright  i dare not tell him  dear father  listen   pray  be calm   sit down  your own hot rage engenders in my mind thoughts  fears  suspicions    ribera  seating himself   i am foolish  hasty  but it makes me mad  listen to me   here sits the prince before me  we talk  we laugh   we have discussed all themes  from the great angelo s divinity  down to the pest of flies that fret us here at the day s hottest   sometimes he will pace the studio  such young blood is seldom still  he brought me once his mandoline  and drew eloquent music thence   i study thus the changeful play of soul   i catch the spirit behind the veil  and burn it on the plate  maria comes and goes  will sit awhile over her broidery  then will haste away and serve us with a dish of golden fruit  that is for me  she knows the sweet  cool juice  after long hours of work  refreshes me more than strong wine   she meets his royal highness as the ribera s child should meet a prince   nor over bold  nor timid  one would think their rank was equal  and that neither sprang from less than royal lineage    annicca           why  i know it  here is no need to excuse or justify  speak rather of your work  is the plate finished    ribera  so nigh  that were don john to leave to morrow  it might go with him    annicca           what  he leaves naples    ribera  yea  but i know not when  he seems to wait momently  orders from his majesty to travel onward    annicca  aside            would he were well away    ribera  what do you mutter   i grow deaf this side    annicca  i spake not  father   i regret with you the prince should leave us  you have more enjoyed his young companionship than any strangers these many years    ribera           well  well  enough of him  he hath a winning air  so far  so good  i know not that i place more trust in him than in another    t is a lying world  i am too old now to be duped or dazzled by fair externals     enter maria  carrying a kirtle full of flowers    maria           father  see  my roses have blossomed over night  i bring you some to prank your study   sister  don tommaso seeks you below    annicca  rising            i will go to meet him   father  until to morrow   embraces maria and exits   maria sits by her father s side and displays her flowers     ribera           truly  a gorgeous show  pink  yellow  crimson  white  which is the fairest  those with the deepest blush should best become you   nay  they accord not with your hair s red gold  the white ones suit you best  pale  innocent  so flowers too can lie   is not that strange   maria looks at him in mingled wonder and affright   he roughly brushes aside all the flowers upon the floors  than picks one up and carefully plucks it to pieces   i think not highly of your flowers  girl  i have plucked this leaf  it has no heart  see there   he laughs contemptuously     maria           what have i done   alas  what mean you  have you then lost your reason    ribera           nay  but found it  i  who was dull of wit  am keen at last   don john is comely   and  don john is kind    a wonderful musician is don john    a princely artist   and then   meek of mien  you enter in his presence  modest  simple  and who beneath that kitten grace had spied the claws of mischief   who   why  all the world  save the fond  wrinkled  hoary fool  thy father  out  girl  for shame   he will be here anon  hence to your room  he shall not find you here  thank god  thank god  no evil hath been wrought that may not be repaired   i have sat by at all your meetings   you shall have no more  myself will look to that   away  away   exit maria     ribera  looks after her   as one who has received a deadly hurt  she walks   what if my doubts be false   the terror of an unlooked for blow  a treacherous thrust when least expected  that is all she showed  on a false charge  myself had acted thus  she had been moved far otherwise if guilty  she had wept  protested  begged  she had not left with such a proud and speechless show of grief  i was too harsh  too quick on slight suspicion  what did annicca say   why  she said naught   t was her grave air  her sudden reticence  her ill assumed indifference   they play on me  they know me not   they dread my violent passions  not guessing what a firm and constant bridle i hold them with   on just cause to be angered  is merely human   yet they sound my temper  they try to lead me like some half tamed beast  that must be coaxed   well  i may laugh thereat  but i am not myself to day  strange pains shoot through my head and limbs and vex my spirit  oh  i have wronged my child   return  maria   exit

stage  maria  she stands   irresolute for a moment on the threshold behind her father    watching him  passes her hand rapidly over her brow and eyes    and then knocks    maria  may i come in  dear father    ribera  putting down his book and looking at her affectionately            child  you ask    maria  advancing   you study late   i came to bid good night    ribera  poor child  thou must be weary   thou art pale still from thy swoon    maria  with a forced laugh            i had forgotten it  nay  i am well again    ribera           but i forget it not  neither forgive myself   well  it is past  enough   when the prince left i sent for thee  thou wast still sleeping    maria  with confusion            yes  i was outworn  what didst thou wish of me    ribera           merely to tell thee don john leaves naples   he expressed regret most courteously that thou wast suffering  he had fain ordered us his parting thanks for our kind welcome  so he deigned to say  to morrow he may steal a moment s grace to see us both once more  but this is doubtful  so he entrusted his farewells to me    maria  may peace go with him    ribera           we are alone   are we not  darling   thanks for the calm content wherewith thou biddest him farewell  to nestle once more in mine embrace   not long  i feel  may these old horny eyes be blest with sight of thy full flowering grace  these wrinkled lips be pressed against thy brow   i am no more what i have been  at times both hand and brain refuse their task   myself will follow soon   the better part of me already dead  so the worm claims us by slow torture  child  thou lt bear with me  if as to day i wrong thy gentle spirit    maria           father  no more  no more  you break my heart    ribera           mine angel child  weep not so bitterly   i thought not thus to move thee  still thou art overwrought   i would have asked at last a promise of thee   i am selfish  but i would sleep less startingly o nights  and bear a calmer soul by day  were i secure that thou wilt bide with me until the end   a pause   to night i will not press thee   thou art weary  thy nerves have scarce regained their tension yet  but from thy deep emotion i can see  t will cost thee less than i have feared   to morrow we will talk of this again    maria           to morrow    ribera           now  good night    t is time thou shouldst be sleeping    maria           father  i cannot leave thee   every word of thine gnaws like a burning coal my sore  soft heart  what  thou shalt suffer  and thine own maria will leave thee daughterless  uncomforted  what  thou shalt weep  and other eyes than mine shall see the spagnoletto s spirit broken    ribera  there  there  poor child   look up  cling not so wildly about my neck   thou art too finely touched  if thus the faint foreshadow of a grief can overcome thee   listen   what was that    maria  starts up  shudders violently  and  all at once  masters       her emotion   why  i heard nothing  father    ribera           yes  a sound of footsteps  and a stifled call   he goes toward the casement   maria tries to detain him     maria           dear father  surely  t was naught   your ears deceive you  the wind is rising  and you heard the leaves rustling together    ribera           nay  i will look forth   he opens the casement and looks out in silence   maria stands behind him

dims the volcano s pillared fire   enough   he closes the casement and returns to maria   hark  how the thunder rolls   my child  you tremble like the blown leaves without    maria           i am oppressed by the same stormy influence   thou knowest i dread the thunder    ribera           thou  who art safely housed  why shouldst thou dread it   try to sleep  my darling  forget the terror of

i trust thee   thou art to me my genius  thou  the breathing image still of thy saint mother  whom the angels guard  even as thou standest now  vested in white  with glowing eyes and pale  unsmiling face  i see her as she stood the day her heart went forth from home and kin to bless the stranger who craved her father s alms    maria           thanks  thanks   good night  god bless us through

arms gropingly to embrace him   oh  let me feel thee near me  i see naught  follow me  here our voices may be heard   she hastens towards the summer house  leaning upon his arm  and sinks upon a seat   have not slow ages passed with crowding woes since we last met   what have i not endured  oh  juan  save me    don john           dearest child  be calm  thou art strangely overwrought   speak not   await till this wild fear be past    maria           how great you are  your simple presence stills and comforts me  while you are here  the one thing real to me in all the universe is love    don john           and yet my love is here  if i be far or nigh  is this the spirit of a soldier s wife  nay  fiery courage  iron fortitude  that soul must own that dares to say   i love     maria  and i dare say it   i can bear the worst that envious fate may heap upon my head  if thou art with me  or for hope of thee    don john  art sure of that   thou couldst not part from me  even for thy father s sake    maria           talk you of parting  for god s sake  what is this   you love no more    don john  rather i love so truly that i shrink from asking thee to share a soldier s fate  i tremble

high duties  to gaze on thy dear face  to feel thy hand  even as now a stay and a caress    don john  angel  i have no thanks   may god forget me when i forget this hour   so  thou art firm   ready this night to leave thy home  thy kin  thy father    maria  solemnly            i am ready and resolved  yet judge me not so lightly as to deem i say this with no pang   my love were naught  could i

publishers  preface to the new  1898  edition   the present edition is of a work which has been for more than thirty years prominently before the public  and which may justly be said to have maintained a standard character   it is issued because of a demand for a better edition than has ever been published   in order to supply this acknowledged want  the publishers have enlarged and perfected this edition by adding some matter not heretofore published in book form   more than one hundred thousand copies of the work have been printed   the plates had become so worn as to render it unreadable  yet the sale kept on   in preparing this new edition  many of the author s fragmentary pieces  not contained in the old edition  have been added   the earliest of the author s writings  published in periodicals in 1862  are included  together with many additional illustrations  which now  for the first time  make the work complete   it is universally conceded that no country in the world has ever produced a genius like artemus ward   writers of acknowledged genius are never very numerous   he attained a great and deserved popularity  which will be lasting   it has been observed that the wit of one generation is rarely appreciated by the next  but this is not true of artemus ward  there is a constant demand for his writings  for the reason that his jokes require no appendix for their elucidation   no one who speaks the english language can fail to appreciate his wonderful humor   it will always be funny   there is a fascination about it which can neither be questioned nor resisted   his particular niche in the temple of fame will not be claimed by another   his intellect was sharp and electric   he saw the humor of anything at a glance  and his manner of relating these laughter provoking absurdities is original and  fetching    preliminary notes by john camden hotten   piccadilly  w   jan  30  1865   there is a story of two  smart  yankees  one named hosea and the other hezekiah  who met in an oyster shop in boston   said hosea   as to opening oysters  why nothing s easier if you only know how     and how s how   asked hezekiah    scotch snuff   replied hosea  very gravely   scotch snuff   bring a little of it ever so near their noses  and they ll sneeze their lids off     i know a man who knows a better plan   observed hezekiah    he spreads the bivalves in a circle  seats himself in the centre  reads a chapter of artemus ward to them  and goes on until they get interested   one by one they gape with astonishment at a  ward s whoppers  and as they gape my friend whips  em out  peppers away  and swallows  em    excellent as all that artemus ward writes really is  and exuberantly overflowing with humour as are nearly all his articles  it is too bad to accuse him of telling  whoppers    on the contrary  the old horatian question of  who shall forbid me to speak truth in laughter   seems ever present to his mind   his latest production is the admirable paper  artemus ward among the fenians  which appears in part 7   if artemus has on any occasion really told  whoppers   it has been in his announcements of being about to visit england   from time to time he has stated his intention of visiting this country  and from time to time has he disappointed his english friends   he was coming to england after his trip to california  when  laden with gold  he could think of no better place to spend it in   he was on his way to england when he and his companion  mr  hingston  encountered the pi ute indians  and narrowly escaped scalping   he was leaving for england with  betsy jane  and the  snaiks  before the american war was ended   he had unscrewed the head of each of his  wax figgers   and sent each on board in a carpet bag  labelled  for england   just as mr lincoln was assassinated   he was hastening to england when the news came a few weeks ago that he had been blown up in an oil well   he has been on his way to england in every newspaper of the american union for the last two years   here is the latest announcement    artemus ward  in a private letter  states that doctor kumming  the famous london seer and profit  having foretold that the end of the world will happen on his own birthday in january 1867  he  artemus  will not visit england until the latter end of 1866  when the people there will be selling off  and dollars will be plentiful   mr  ward says that he shall leave england in the last steamer  in time to see the american eagle spread his wings  and with the stars and stripes in his beek and tallents  sore away to his knativ empyrehum      american paper   but even this is likely to be a  whopper   for a more reliable private letter from artemus declares his fixed purpose to leave for england in the steamship city of boston early in june  and the probabilities are that he will be stepping on english shores just about the time that these pages go to press   lest anything should happen to him  and england be for ever deprived of seeing him  the most recent production of his pen  together with two or three of his best things  are here embalmed for preservation  on the principle adopted by the affectionate widow of the bear trainer of perpignan    i have nothing left   said the woman   i am absolutely without a roof to shelter me and the poor animal     animal   exclaimed the prefect   you don t mean to say that you keep the bear that devoured your husband    alas   she replied   it is all that is left to me of the poor dear man    if any other excuse be needed for thus presenting the british public with a  ward s  last   in addition to the pertinency of the article and its real merit  that excuse may be found in the fact that it is thoroughly new to readers on this side of the atlantic   the general public will undoubtedly receive  artemus ward among the fenians  with approving laughter   should it fall into the hands of a philo fenian the effect may be different   to him it would probably have the wrong action of the yankee bone picking machine    i ve got a new machine   said a yankee pedlar   for picking bones out of fish   now  i tell you  it s a leetle bit the darndest thing you ever did see   all you have to do is to set it on a table and turn a crank  and the fish flies right down your throat and the bones right under the grate   well  there was a country greenhorn got hold of it the other day  and he turned the crank the wrong way  and  i tell you  the way the bones flew down his throat was awful   why  it stuck that fellow so full of bones  that he could not get his shirt off for a whole week    in addition to the paper on the fenians  two other articles by artemus ward are reprinted in the present work   one relates to the city of washington  and the other to the author s imaginary town of baldinsville   both are highly characteristic of the writer and of his quaint spellings  a heterography not more odd than that of the postmaster of shawnee county  missouri  who  returning his account to the general office  wrote   i hearby sertify that the four going a counte is as nere rite as i now how to make it  if there is any mistake it is not dun a purpers    artemus ward has created a new model for funny writers  and the fact is noticeable that  in various parts of this country as well as in his own  he has numerous puny imitators  who suppose that by simply adopting his comic spelling they can write quite as well as he can   perhaps it would be as well if they remembered the joke of poor thomas hood  who said that he could write as well as shakespere if he had the mind to  but the trouble was  he had not got the mind              a biographical sketch by melville d  landon   charles farrar browne  better known to the world as  artemus ward   was born at waterford  oxford county  maine  on the twenty sixth of april  1834  and died of consumption at southampton  england  on wednesday  the sixth of march  1867   his father  levi browne  was a land surveyor  and justice of the peace   his mother  caroline e  brown  is still living  and is a descendant from puritan stock   mr  browne s business manager  mr  hingston  once asked him about his puritanic origin  when he replied    i think we came from jerusalem  for my father s name was levi and we had a moses and a nathan in the family  but my poor brother s name was cyrus  so  perhaps  that makes us persians    charles was partially educated at the waterford school  when family circumstances induced his parents to apprentice him to learn the rudiments of printing in the office of the  skowhegan clarion   published some miles to the north of his native village   here he passed through the dreadful ordeal to which a printer s  devil  is generally subjected   he always kept his temper  and his eccentric boy jokes are even now told by the residents of skowhegan   in the spring  after his fifteenth birthday  charles browne bade farewell to the  skowhegan clarion   and we next hear of him in the office of the  carpet bag   edited by b p  shillaber   mrs  partington     lean  lank  but strangely appreciative  young browne used to  set up  articles from the pens of charles g  halpine   miles o reilly   and john g  saxe  the poet   here he wrote his first contribution in a disguised hand  slyly put it into the editorial box  and the next day disguised his pleasure while setting it up himself   the article was a description of a fourth of july celebration in skowhegan   the spectacle of the day was a representation of the battle of yorktown  with g  washington and general horace cornwallis in character   the article pleased mr  shillaber  and mr  browne  afterwards speaking of it  said    i went to the theatre that evening  had a good time of it  and thought i was the greatest man in boston    while engaged on the  carpet bag   the subject of our sketch closely studied the theatre and courted the society of actors and actresses   it was in this way that he gained that correct and valuable knowledge of the texts and characters of the drama  which enabled him in after years to burlesque them so successfully   the humorous writings of seba smith were his models  and the oddities of  john phoenix  were his especial admiration   being of a roving temper charles browne soon left boston  and  after traveling as a journeyman printer over much of new york and massachusetts  he turned up in the town of tiffin  seneca county  ohio  where he became reporter and compositor at four dollars per week   after making many friends among the good citizens of tiffin  by whom he is remembered as a patron of side shows and traveling circuses  our hero suddenly set out for toledo  on the lake  where he immediately made a reputation as a writer of sarcastic paragraphs in the columns of the toledo  commercial   he waged a vigorous newspaper war with the reporters of the toledo  blade   but while the  blade  indulged in violent vituperation   artemus  was good natured and full of humor   his column soon gained a local fame and everybody read it   his fame even traveled away to cleveland  where  in 1858  when mr  browne was twenty four years of age  mr  j w  gray of the cleveland  plaindealer  secured him as local reporter  at a salary of twelve dollars per week   here his reputation first began to assume a national character and it was here that they called him a  fool  when he mentioned the idea of taking the field as a lecturer   speaking of this circumstance while traveling down the mississippi with the writer  in 1865  mr  browne musingly repeated this colloquy   wise man    ah  you poor foolish little girl  here is a dollar for you    foolish little girl    thank you  sir  but i have a sister at home as foolish as i am  can t you give me a dollar for her    charles browne was not successful as a news reporter  lacking enterprise and energy  but his success lay in writing up in a burlesque manner well known public affairs like prize fights  races  spiritual meetings  and political gatherings   his department became wonderfully humorous  and was always a favorite with readers  whether there was any news in it or not   sometimes he would have a whole column of letters from young ladies in reply to a fancied matrimonial advertisement  and then he would have a column of answers to general correspondents like this     veritas   many make the same error   mr  key  who wrote the  star spangled banner   is not the author of hamlet  a tragedy   he wrote the banner business  and assisted in  the female pirate   but did not write hamlet   hamlet was written by a talented but unscrupulous man named macbeth  afterwards tried and executed for  murdering sleep    young clergyman   two pints of rum  two quarts of hot water  tea  cup of sugar  and a lemon  grate in nutmeg  stir thoroughly and drink while hot   it was during his engagement on the  plaindealer  that he wrote  dating from indiana  his first communication   the first published letter following this sketch  signed  artemus ward  a sobriquet purely incidental  but borne with the  u  changed to an  a  by an american revolutionary general   it was here that mr  browne first became  in words  the possessor of a moral show  consisting of three moral bares  the a kangaroo  a amoozing little rascal   twould make you larf yourself to death to see the little kuss jump and squeal   wax figures of g  washington   c   c    hundreds of newspapers copied this letter  and charles browne awoke one morning to find himself famous   in the  plaindealer  office  his companion  george hoyt  writes   his desk was a rickety table which had been whittled and gashed until it looked as if it had been the victim of lightning   his chair was a fit companion thereto   a wabbling  unsteady affair  sometimes with four and sometimes with three legs   but browne saw neither the table  nor the chair  nor any person who might be near  nothing  in fact  but the funny pictures which were tumbling out of his brain   when writing  his gaunt form looked ridiculous enough   one leg hung over the arm of his chair like a great hook  while he would write away  sometimes laughing to himself  and then slapping the table in the excess of his mirth    while in the office of the  plaindealer   mr  browne first conceived the idea of becoming a lecturer   in attending the various minstrel shows and circuses which came to the city  he would frequently hear repeated some story of his own which the audience would receive with hilarity   his best witticisms came back to him from the lips of another who made a living by quoting a stolen jest   then the thought came to him to enter the lecture field himself  and become the utterer of his own witticisms  the mouthpiece of his own jests   on the 10th of november  1860  charles browne  whose fame  traveling in his letters from boston to san francisco  had now become national  grasped the hands of his hundreds of new york admirers   cleveland had throned him the monarch of mirth  and a thousand hearts paid him tributes of adulation as he closed his connection with the cleveland press   arriving in the empire city  mr  browne soon opened an engagement with  vanity fair   a humorous paper after the manner of london  punch   and ere long he succeeded mr  charles g  leland as editor   mr  charles dawson shanly says    after artemus ward became sole editor  a position which he held for a brief period  many of his best contributions were given to the public  and  whatever there was of merit in the columns of  vanity fair  from the time he assumed the editorial charge  emanated from his pen   mr  browne himself wrote to a friend    comic copy is what they wanted for  vanity fair    i wrote some and it killed it   the poor paper got to be a conundrum  and so i gave it up    the idea of entering the field as a lecturer now seized mr  browne stronger than ever   tired of the pen  he resolved on trying the platform   his bohemian friends agreed that his fame and fortune would be made before intelligent audiences   he resolved to try it   what should be the subject of my lecture  how shall i treat the subject   these questions caused mr  browne grave speculations   among other schemes  he thought of a string of jests combined with a stream of satire  the whole being unconnected  a burlesque upon a lecture   the subject   that was a hard question   first he thought of calling it  my seven grandmothers   but he finally adopted the name of  babes in the woods   and with this subject charles browne was introduced to a metropolitan audience  on the evening of december 23d  1861   the place was clinton hall  which stood on the site of the old astor place opera house  where years ago occurred the macready riot  and where now is the mercantile library   previous to this introduction  mr  frank wood accompanied him to the suburban town of norwich  connecticut  where he first delivered his lecture  and watched the result   the audience was delighted  and mr  browne received an ovation   previous to his clinton hall appearance the city was flooded with funny placards reading                          artemus ward                           will                       speak a piece   owing to a great storm  only a small audience braved the elements  and the clinton hall lecture was not a financial success   it consisted of a wandering batch of comicalities  touching upon everything except  the babes    indeed it was better described by the lecturer in london  when he said   one of the features of my entertainment is  that it contains so many things that don t have anything to do with it    in the middle of his lecture  the speaker would hesitate  stop  and say    owing to a slight indisposition we will now have an intermission of fifteen minutes    the audience looked in utter dismay at the idea of staring at vacancy for a quarter of an hour  when  rubbing his hands  the lecturer would continue   but  ah  during the intermission i will go on with my lecture    mr  browne s first volume  entitled  artemus ward  his book   was published in new york  may 17th  1862   the volume was everywhere hailed with enthusiasm  and over forty thousand copies were sold  great success also attended the sale of his three other volumes published in  65   67  and  69   mr  browne s next lecture was entitled  sixty minutes in africa   and was delivered in musical fund hall  philadelphia   behind him hung a large map of africa   which region   said artemus   abounds in various natural productions  such as reptiles and flowers   it produces the red rose  the white rose  and the neg  roes   in the middle of the continent is what is called a  howling wilderness   but  for my part  i have never heard it howl  nor met with any one who has    after mr  browne had created immense enthusiasm for his lectures and books in the eastern states  which filled his pockets with a handsome exchequer  he started  october 3d  1863  for california  a faithful account of which trip is given by himself in this book   previous to starting  he received a telegram from thomas maguire  of the san francisco opera house  inquiring  what he would take for forty nights in california    mr  brown immediately telegraphed back                         brandy and water                                a  ward    and  though maguire was sorely puzzled at the contents of the dispatch  the press got hold of it  and it went through california as a capital joke   mr  browne first lectured in san francisco on  the babes in the woods   november 13th  1863  at pratt s hall   t  starr king took a deep interest in him  occupying the rostrum  and his general reception in san francisco was warm   returning overland  through salt lake to the states  in the fall of 1864  mr  browne lectured again in new york  this time on the  mormons   to immense audiences  and in the spring of 1865 he commenced his tour through the country  everywhere drawing enthusiastic audiences both north and south   it was while on this tour that the writer of this sketch again spent some time with him   we met at memphis and traveled down the mississippi together   at lake providence the  indiana  rounded up to our landing  and mr  browne accompanied the writer to his plantation  where he spent several days  mingling in seeming infinite delight with the negroes   for them he showed great fondness  and they used to stand around him in crowds listening to his seemingly serious advice   we could not prevail upon him to hunt or to join in any of the equestrian amusements with the neighboring planters  but a quiet fascination drew him to the negroes   strolling through the  quarters   his grave words  too deep with humor for darkey comprehension  gained their entire confidence   one day he called up uncle jeff   an uncle tom like patriarch  and commenced in his usual vein    now  uncle jefferson   he said   why do you thus pursue the habits of industry   this course of life is wrong  all wrong  all a base habit  uncle jefferson   now try to break it off   look at me    look at mr  landon  the chivalric young southern plantist from new york  he toils not  neither does he spin  he pursues a career of contented idleness   if you only thought so  jefferson  you could live for months without performing any kind of labor  and at the expiration of that time feel fresh and vigorous enough to commence it again   idleness refreshes the physical organization   it is a sweet boon   strike at the roots of the destroying habit to day  jefferson   it tires you out  resolve to be idle  no one should labor  he should hire others to do it for him   and then he would fix his mournful eyes on jeff  and hand him a dollar  while the eyes of the wonder struck darkey would gaze in mute admiration upon the good and wise originator of the only theory which the darkey mind could appreciate   as jeff  went away to tell the wonderful story to his companions  and backed it with the dollar as material proof  artemus would cover his eyes  and bend forward on his elbows in a chuckling laugh    among the mormons  was delivered through the states  everywhere drawing immense crowds   his manner of delivering his discourse was grotesque and comical beyond description   his quaint and sad style contributed more than anything else to render his entertainment exquisitely funny   the programme was exceedingly droll  and the tickets of admission presented the most ludicrous of ideas   the writer presents a fac simile of an admission ticket which was presented to him in natchez by mr  browne                        admit the bearer                      and one wife                             yours trooly                                   a  ward   in the spring of 1866  charles browne first timidly thought of going to europe   turning to mr  hingston one day he asked   what sort of a man is albert smith   do you think the mormons would be as good a subject to the londoners as mont blanc was   then he said    i should like to go to london and give my lecture in the same place   can t it be done    mr  browne sailed for england soon after  taking with him his panorama   the success that awaited him could scarcely have been anticipated by his most intimate friends   scholars  wits  poets  and novelists came to him with extended hands  and his stay in london was one ovation to the genius of american wit   charles reade  the novelist  was his warm friend and enthusiastic admirer  and mr  andrew haliday introduced him to the  literary club   where he became a great favorite   mark lemon came to him and asked him to become a contributor to  punch   which he did  his  punch  letters were more remarked in literary circles than any other current matter   there was hardly a club meeting or a dinner at which they were not discussed    there was something so grotesque in the idea   said a correspondent   of this ruthless yankee poking among the revered antiquities of britain  that the beef eating british themselves could not restrain their laughter   the story of his uncle william who  followed commercial pursuits  glorious commerce  and sold soap   and his letters on the tower and  chowser   were palpable hits  and it was admitted that  punch  had contained nothing better since the days of  yellowplush    this opinion was shared by the  times   the literary reviews  and the gayest leaders of society   the publishers of  punch  posted up his name in large letters over their shop in fleet street  and artemus delighted to point it out to his friends   about this time mr  browne wrote to his friend jack rider  of cleveland    this is the proudest moment of my life   to have been as well appreciated here as at home  to have written for the oldest comic journal in the english language  received mention with hood  with jerrold and hook  and to have my picture and my pseudonym as common in london as in new york  is enough for                                           yours truly                                                   a  ward    england was thoroughly aroused to the merits of artemus ward  before he commenced his lectures at egyptian hall  and when  in november  he finally appeared  immense crowds were compelled to turn away   at every lecture his fame increased  and when sickness brought his brilliant success to an end  a nation mourned his retirement   on the evening of friday  the seventh week of his engagement at egyptian hall  artemus became seriously ill  an apology was made to a disappointed audience  and from that time the light of one of the greatest wits of the centuries commenced fading into darkness   the press mourned his retirement  and a funeral pall fell over london   the laughing  applauding crowds were soon to see his consumptive form moving towards its narrow resting place in the cemetery at kensal green   by medical advice charles browne went for a short time to the island of jersey  but the breezes of jersey were powerless   he wrote to london to his nearest and dearest friends  the members of a literary club of which he was a member  to complain that his  loneliness weighed on him    he was brought back  but could not sustain the journey farther than southampton   there the members of the club traveled from london to see him  two at a time  that he might be less lonely   his remains were followed to the grave from the rooms of his friend arthur sketchley  by a large number of friends and admirers  the literati and press of london paying the last tribute of respect to their dead brother   the funeral services were conducted by the rev  m d  conway  formerly of cincinnati  and the coffin was temporarily placed in a vault  from which it was removed by his american friends  and his body now sleeps by the side of his father  levi browne  in the quiet cemetery at waterford  maine   upon the coffin is the simple inscription                          charles f  browne                        aged 32 years            better known to the world as  artemus ward     his english executors were t w  robertson  the playwright  and his friend and companion  e p  hingston   his literary executors were horace greeley and richard h  stoddard   in his will  he bequeathed among other things a large sum of money to his little valet  a bright little fellow  though subsequent denouments revealed the fact that he left only a six thousand dollar house in yonkers   there is still some mystery about his finances  which may one day be revealed   it is known that he withdrew 10 000 dollars from the pacific bank to deposit it with a friend before going to england  besides this  his london  punch  letters paid a handsome profit   among his personal friends were george hoyt  the late daniel setchell  charles w   coe  and mr  mullen  the artist  all of whom he used to style  my friends all the year round    personally charles farrar browne was one of the kindest and most affectionate of men  and history does not name a man who was so universally beloved by all who knew him   it was remarked  and truly  that the death of no literary character since washington irving caused such general and widespread regret   in stature he was tall and slender   his nose was prominent    outlined like that of sir charles napier  or mr  seward  his eyes brilliant  small  and close together  his mouth large  teeth white and pearly  fingers long and slender  hair soft  straight  and blonde  complexion florid  mustache large  and his voice soft and clear   in bearing  he moved like a natural born gentleman  in his lectures he never smiled  not even while he was giving utterance to the most delicious absurdities  but all the while the jokes fell from his lips as if he was unconscious of their meaning   while writing his lectures  he would laugh and chuckle to himself continually   there was one peculiarity about charles browne  he never made an enemy   other wits in other times have been famous  but a satirical thrust now and then has killed a friend   diogenes was the wit of greece  but when  after holding up an old dried fish to draw away the eyes of anaximenes  audience  he exclaimed  see how an old fish is more interesting than anaximenes   he said a funny thing  but he stabbed a friend   when charles lamb  in answer to the doting mother s question as to how he liked babies  replied   b b boiled  madam  boiled   that mother loved him no more   and when john randolph said  thank you   to his constituent who kindly remarked that he had the pleasure of passing his house  it was wit at the expense of friendship   the whole english school of wits  with douglas jerrold  hood  sheridan  and sidney smith  indulged in repartee   they were parasitic wits   and so with the irish  except that an irishman is generally so ridiculously absurd in his replies as to only excite ridicule    artemus ward  made you laugh and love him too   the wit of  artemus ward  and  josh billings  is distinctively american   lord kames  in his  elements of criticism   makes no mention of this species of wit  a lack which the future rhetorician should look to   we look in vain for it in the english language of past ages  and in other languages of modern time   it is the genus american   when artemus says in that serious manner  looking admiringly at his atrocious pictures    i love pictures  and i have many of them  beautiful photographs  of myself   you smile  and when he continues   these pictures were painted by the old masters  they painted these pictures and then they  they expired   you hardly know what it is that makes you laugh outright  and when josh billings says in his proverbs  wiser than solomon s  you d better not know so much  than know so many things that ain t so    the same vein is struck  but the text books fail to explain scientifically the cause of our mirth   the wit of charles browne is of the most exalted kind   it is only scholars and those thoroughly acquainted with the subtilty of our language who fully appreciate it   his wit is generally about historical personages like cromwell  garrick  or shakspeare  or a burlesque on different styles of writing  like his french novel  when hifalutin phrases of tragedy come from the clodhopper who   sells soap and thrice  refuses a ducal coronet    mr  browne mingled the eccentric even in his business

place in the sombre shades of kensal green  jesting ceased  and one great anglo american heart                like a muffled drum went beating                funeral marches to his grave                                     melville d  landon     introduction  by t w  robertson   few tasks are more difficult or delicate than to write on the subject of the works or character of a departed friend   the pen falters as the familiar face looks out of the paper   the mind is diverted from the thought of death as the memory recalls some happy epigram   it seems so strange that the hand that traced the jokes should be cold  that the tongue that trolled out the good things should be silent  that the jokes and the good things should remain  and the man who made them should be gone for ever   the works of charles farrar browne  who was known to the world as  artemus ward   have run through so many editions  have met with such universal popularity  and have been so widely criticised  that it is needless to mention them here   so many biographies have been written of the gentleman who wrote in the character of the  cute yankee showman  that it is unnecessary that i should touch upon his life  belongings  or adventures   of  artemus ward  i know just as much as the rest of the world   i prefer  therefore  to speak of charles farrar browne  as i knew him  and  in doing so  i can promise those friends who also knew him and esteemed him  that as i consider no  public  man so public  that some portion of his work  pleasures  occupations  and habits may not be considered private  i shall only mention how kind and noble minded was the man of whom i write  without dragging forward special and particular acts in proof of my words  as if the goodness of his mind and character needed the certificate of facts   i first saw charles browne at a literary club  he had only been a few hours in london  and he seemed highly pleased and excited at finding himself in the old city to which his thoughts had so often wandered   browne was an intensely sympathetic man   his brain and feelings were as a  lens   and he received impressions immediately  no man could see him without liking him at once   his manner was straightforward and genial  and had in it the dignity of a gentleman  tempered  as it were  by the fun of the humorist   when you heard him talk you wanted to make much of him  not because he was  artemus ward   but because he was himself  for no one less resembled  artemus ward  than his author and creator  charles farrar browne   but a few weeks ago it was remarked to me that authors were a disappointing race to know  and i agreed with the remark  and i remember a lady once said to me that the personal appearance of poets seldom  came up  to their works   to this i replied that  after all  poets were but men  and that it was as unreasonable to expect that the late sir walter scott could at all resemble a gathering of the clans as that the late lord macaulay should appear anything like the committal of the seven bishops to the tower   i told the lady that she was unfair to eminent men if she hoped that celebrated engineers would look like tubular bridges  or that sir edwin landseer would remind her of a  midsummer night s dream    i mention this because  of all men in the world  my friend charles browne was the least like a showman of any man i ever encountered  i can remember the odd half disappointed look of some of the visitors to the egyptian hall when  artemus  stepped upon the platform   at first they thought that he was a gentleman who appeared to apologise for the absence of the showman   they had pictured to themselves a coarse old man  with a damp eye and a puckered mouth  one eyebrow elevated an inch above the other to express shrewdness and knowledge of the world  a man clad in velveteen and braid  with a heavy watch chain  large rings  and horny hands  the touter to a waxwork show  with a hoarse voice  and over familiar manner   the slim gentleman in evening dress  polished manners  and gentle voice  with a tone of good breeding that hovered between deference and jocosity  the owner of those thin  those much too thin  white hands could not be the man who spelt joke with a  g    folks who came to laugh  began to fear that they should remain to be instructed  until the gentlemanly disappointer began to speak  then they recovered their real  artemus   betsy jane  wax figgers  and all   will patriotic americans forgive me if i say that charles browne loved england dearly   he had been in london but a few days when he paid a visit to the tower   he knew english history better than most englishmen  and the tower of london was to him the history of england embalmed in stone and mortar   no man had more reverence in his nature  and at the tower he saw that what he had read was real   there were the beef eaters  there had been queen elizabeth and sir walter raleigh  and lady jane grey  and shakspere s murdered princes  and their brave  cruel uncle   there was the block and the axe  and the armour and the jewels    st george for merrie england   had been shouted in the holy land  and men of the same blood as himself had been led against the infidel by men of the same brain and muscle as george washington   robin hood was a reality  and not a schoolboy s myth like ali baba and valentine and orson   there were two sets of feelings in charles browne at the tower   he could appreciate the sublimity of history  but  as the  show  part of the exhibition was described to him  the humorist  the wit  and the iconoclast from the other side the atlantic must have smiled at the  descriptions    the  tower  was a  show   like his own  artemus ward s   a price was paid for admission  and the  figgers  were  orated    real jewellery is very like sham jewellery after all  and the  artemus  vein in charles browne s mental constitution  the vein of humour  whose source was a strong contempt of all things false  mean  shabby  pretentious  and only external  of bunkum and barnumisation  must have seen a gigantic speculation realising shiploads of dollars if the tower could have been taken over to the states  and exhibited from town to town  the stars and stripes flying over it  with a four horse lecture to describe the barbarity of the ancient british barons and the cuss of chivalry   artemus ward s lecture on the mormons at the egyptian hall  piccadilly  was a great success   his humour was so entirely fresh  new  and unconventional  it took his hearers by surprise  and charmed them   his failing health compelled him to abandon the lecture after about eight or ten weeks   indeed  during that brief period he was once or twice compelled to dismiss his audience   i have myself seen him sink into a chair and nearly faint after the exertion of dressing   he exhibited the greatest anxiety to be at his post at the appointed time  and scrupulously exerted himself to the utmost to entertain his auditors   it was not because he was sick that the public was to be disappointed  or that their enjoyment was to be diminished   during the last few weeks of his lecture giving he steadily abstained from accepting any of the numerous invitations he received   had he lived through the following london fashionable season  there is little doubt that the room at the egyptian hall would have been thronged nightly   our aristocracy have a fine delicate sense of humour  and the success  artistic and pecuniary  of  artemus ward  would have rivalled that of the famous  lord dundreary    there are many stupid people who did not understand the  fun  of artemus ward s books   in their vernacular  they didn t see it    there were many stupid people who did not understand the fun of artemus ward s lecture on the mormons  they could not see it   highly respectable people  the pride of their parish  when they heard of a lecture  upon the mormons    expected to see a solemn person  full of old saws and new statistics  who would denounce the sin of polygamy  and bray against polygamists with four and twenty boiling water baptist power of denunciation   these uncomfortable christians do not like humour  they dread it as a certain personage is said to dread holy water  and for the same reason that thieves fear policemen  it finds them out   when these good idiots heard artemus offer  if they did not like the lecture in piccadilly  to give them free tickets for the same lecture in california  when he next visited that country  they turned to each other indignantly  and said  what use are tickets for california to us   we are not going to california   no  we are too good  too respectable  to go so far from home   the man is a fool   one of these ornaments of the vestry complained to the doorkeepers  and denounced the lecture as an imposition   and   said the wealthy parishioner   as for the panorama  it s the worst painted thing i ever saw in all my life    but the entertainment  original  humorous  and racy though it was  was drawing to a close   in the fight between youth and death  death was to conquer   by medical advice charles browne went for a short time to jersey  but the breezes of jersey were powerless   he wrote to london to his nearest and dearest friends  the members of a literary club of which he was a member  to complain that his  loneliness weighed on him    he was brought back  but could not sustain the journey farther than southampton   there the members of the beforementioned club travelled from london to see him  two at a time  that he might be less lonely  and for the unwearying solicitude of his friend and agent  mr  hingston  and to the kindly sympathy of the united states consul at southampton  charles browne s best and dearest friends had cause to be grateful   i cannot close these lines without mention of  artemus ward s  last joke   he had read in the newspapers that a wealthy american had offered to present the prince of wales with a splendid yacht  american built    it seems   said the invalid   a fashion now a days for everybody to present the prince of wales with something   i think i shall leave him  my panorama    charles browne died beloved and regretted by all who knew him  and by many who had known him but a few weeks  and when he drew his last breath  there passed away the spirit of a true gentleman                                              t w  robertson london  august 11  1868   prefatory note                     by edward p  hingston   in cleveland  ohio  the pleasant city beside the lakes  artemus ward first determined to become a public lecturer   he and i rambled through cleveland together after his return from california   he called on some old friends at the herald office  then went over to the weddel house  and afterwards strolled across to the offices of the  plain dealer   where  in his position as sub editor  he had written many of his earlier essays   artemus inquired for mr  gray  the editor  who chanced to be absent   looking round at the vacant desks and inkstained furniture  artemus was silent for a minute or two  and then burst into one of those peculiar chuckling fits of laughter in which he would occasionally indulge  not a loud laugh  but a shaking of the whole body with an impulse of merriment which set every muscle in motion    here   said he   here s where they called me a fool    the remembrance of their so calling him seemed to afford him intense amusement    from the office of the cleveland plain dealer we continued our tour of the town   presently we found ourselves in front of perry s statue  the monument erected to commemorate the naval engagement on lake erie  wherein the americans came off victorious   artemus looked up to the statue  laid his finger to the side of his nose  and  in his quaint manner  remarked   i wonder whether they called him  a fool  too  when he went to fight    the remark  following close as it did upon his laughing fit in the newspaper office  caused me to inquire why he had been called  a fool   and who had called him so    it was the opinion of my friends on the paper   he replied    i told them that i was going in for lecturing   they laughed at me  and called me  a fool    don t you think they were right    then we sauntered up euclid street  under the shade of its avenue of trees   as we went along  artemus ward recounted to me the story of his becoming a lecturer   our conversation on that agreeable evening is fresh in my remembrance   memory still listens to the voice of my companion in the stroll  still sees the green trees of euclid street casting their shadows across our path  and still joins in the laugh with artemus  who  having just returned from california  where he had taken sixteen hundred dollars at one lecture  did not think that to be evidence of his having lost his senses   the substance of that which artemus ward then told me was  that while writing for the  cleveland plain dealer  he was accustomed  in the discharge of his duties as a reporter  to attend the performances of the various minstrel troups and circuses which visited the neighbourhood   at one of these he would hear some story of his own  written a month or two previously  given by the  middle man  of the minstrels and received with hilarity by the audience   at another place he would be entertained by listening to jokes of his own invention  coarsely retailed by the clown of the ring  and shouted at by the public as capital waggery on the part of the performer   his own good things from the lips of another  came back to him with alienated majesty   as emerson expresses it   then the thought would steal over him  why should that man gain a living with my witticisms  and i not use them in the same way myself  why not be the utterer of my own coinage  the quoter of my own jests  the mouthpiece of my own merry conceits   certainly  it was not a very exalted ambition to aim at the glories of a circus clown or the triumphs of a minstrel with a blackened face   but  in the united states a somewhat different view is taken of that which is fitting and seemly for a man to do  compared with the estimate we form in this country   in a land where the theory of caste is not admitted  the relative respectability of the various professions is not quite the same as it is with us   there the profession does not disqualify if the man himself be right  nor the claim to the title of gentleman depend upon the avocation followed   i know of one or two clowns in the ring who are educated physicians  and not thought to be any the less gentlemen because they propound conundrums and perpetrate jests instead of prescribing pills and potions   artemus ward was always very self reliant  when once he believed himself to be in the right it was almost impossible to persuade him to the contrary   but  at the same time  he was cautious in the extreme  and would well consider his position before deciding that which was right or wrong for him to do   the idea of becoming a public man having taken possession of his mind  the next point to decide was in what form he should appear before the public   that of a humorous lecturer seemed to him to be the best   it was unoccupied ground   america had produced entertainers who by means of facial changes or eccentricities of costume had contrived to amuse their audiences  but there was no one who ventured to joke for an hour before a house full of people with no aid from scenery or dress  the experiment was one which artemus resolved to try   accordingly  he set himself to work to collect all his best quips and cranks  to invent what new drolleries he could  and to remember all the good things that he had heard or met with   these he noted down and strung together almost without relevancy or connexion   the manuscript chanced to fall into the hands of the people at the office of the newspaper on which he was then employed  and the question was put to him of what use he was going to make of the strange jumble of jest which he had thus compiled   his answer was that he was about to turn lecturer  and that before them were the materials of his lecture   it was then that his friends laughed at him  and characterised him as  a fool     they had some right to think so   said artemus to me as we rambled up euclid street    i half thought that i was one myself   i don t look like a lecturer  do i    he was always fond  poor fellow  of joking on the subject of his personal appearance   his spare figure and tall stature  his prominent nose and his light colored hair  were each made the subject of a joke at one time or another in the course of his lecturing career   if he laughed largely at the foibles of others  he was equally disposed to laugh at any shortcomings he could detect in himself   if anything at all in his outward form was to him a source of vanity  it was the delicate formation of his hands  white  soft  long  slender  and really handsome  they were more like the hands of a high born lady than those of a western editor   he attended to them with careful pride  and never alluded to them as a subject for his jokes  until  in his last illness  they had become unnaturally fair  translucent  and attenuated   then it was that a friend calling upon him at his apartments in piccadilly  endeavoured to cheer him at a time of great mental depression  and pleasantly reminded him of a ride they had long ago projected through the south western states of the union    we must do that ride yet  artemus   short stages at first  and longer ones as we go on    poor artemus lifted up his pale  slender hands  and letting the light shine through them  said jocosely   do you think these would do to hold a rein with    why  the horse would laugh at them    having collected a sufficient number of quaint thoughts  whimsical fancies  bizarre notions  and ludicrous anecdotes  the difficulty which then  according to his own confession  occurred to artemus ward was  what should be the title of his lecture   the subject was no difficulty at all  for the simple reason that there was not to be any   the idea of instructing or informing his audience never once entered into his plans   his intention was merely to amuse  if possible  keep the house in continuous laughter for an hour and a half  or rather an hour and twenty minutes  for that was the precise time  in his belief  which people could sit to listen and to laugh without becoming bored  and  if possible  send his audience home well pleased with the lecturer and with themselves  without their having any clear idea of that which they had been listening to  and not one jot the wiser than when they came   no one better understood than artemus the wants of a miscellaneous audience who paid their dollar or half dollar each to be amused   no one could gauge better than he the capacity of the crowd to feed on pure fun  and no one could discriminate more clearly than he the fitness  temper  and mental appetite of the constituents of his evening assemblies   the prosiness of an ordinary mechanics  institute lecture was to him simply abhorrent  the learned platitudes of a professed lecturer were to him  to use one of his own phrases   worse than poison    to make people laugh was to be his primary endeavour   if in so making them laugh he could also cause them to see through a sham  be ashamed of some silly national prejudice  or suspicious of the value of some current piece of political bunkum  so much the better   he believed in laughter as thoroughly wholesome  he had the firmest conviction that fun is healthy  and sportiveness the truest sign of sanity   like talleyrand  he was of opinion that  qui vit sans jolie n est pas si sage qu il croit    artemus ward s first lecture was entitled  the babes in the wood   i asked him why he chose that title  because there was nothing whatever in the lecture relevant to the subject of the child book legend   he replied   it seemed to sound the best   i once thought of calling the lecture  my seven grandmothers    don t you think that would have been good    it would at any rate have been just as pertinent   incongruity as an element of fun was always an idea uppermost in the mind of the western humorist   i am not aware that the notes of any of his lectures  except those of his mormon experience  have been preserved  and i have some doubts if any one of his lectures  except the mormon one  was ever fairly written out    the babes in the wood   as a lecture  was a pure and unmitigated  sell    it was merely joke after joke  and drollery succeeding to drollery  without any connecting thread whatever   it was an exhibition of fireworks  owing half its brilliancy and more than half its effect to the skill of the man who grouped the fireworks together and let them off   in the hands of any other pyrotechnist the squibs would have failed to light  the rockets would have refused to ascend  and the  nine bangers  would have exploded but once or twice only  instead of nine times   the artist of the display being no more  and the fireworks themselves having gone out  it is perhaps not to be regretted that the cases of the squibs and the tubes of the rockets have not been carefully kept   most of the good things introduced by artemus ward in his first lecture were afterwards incorporated by him in subsequent writings  or used over again in his later entertainment   many of them had reference to the events of the day  the circumstances of the american war and the politics of the great rebellion   these  of course  have lost their interest with the passing away of the times which gave them birth   the points of many of the jokes have corroded  and the barbed head of many an arrow of artemus s wit has rusted into bluntness with the decay of the bow from which it was propelled   if i remember rightly  the  babes in the wood  were never mentioned more than twice in the whole lecture   first  when the lecturer told his audience that the  babes  were to constitute the subject of his discourse  and then digressed immediately to matters quite foreign to the story   then again at the conclusion of the hour and twenty minutes of drollery  when he finished up in this way   i now come to my subject  the babes in the wood     here he would take out his watch  look at it with affected surprise  put on an appearance of being greatly perplexed  and amidst roars of laughter from the people  very gravely continue   but i find that i have exceeded my time  and will therefore merely remark that  so far as i know  they were very good babes  they were as good as ordinary babes   i really have not time to go into their history   you will find it all in the story books   they died in the woods  listening to the woodpecker tapping the hollow beech tree   it was a sad fate for them  and i pity them   so  i hope  do you   good night    artemus gave his first lecture at norwich in connecticut  and travelled over a considerable portion of the eastern states before he ventured to give a sample of his droll oratory in the western cities  wherein he had earned reputation as a journalist   gradually his popularity became very great  and in place of letting himself out at so much per night to literary societies and athenaeums  he constituted himself his own showman  engaging that indispensable adjunct to all showmen in the united states  an agent to go ahead  engage halls  arrange for the sale of tickets  and engineer the success of the show   newspapers had carried his name to every village of the union  and his writings had been largely quoted in every journal   it required  therefore  comparatively little advertising to announce his visit to any place in which he had to lecture   but it was necessary that he should have a bill or poster of some kind   the one he adopted was simple  quaint  striking  and well adapted to the purpose   it was merely one large sheet  with a black ground  and the letters cut out in the block  so as to print white   the reading was  artemus ward will speak a piece    to the american mind this was intensely funny from its childish absurdity  it is customary in the states for children to speak or recite  a piece  at school at the annual examination  and the phrase is used just in the same sense as in england we say  a christmas piece   the professed subject of the lecture being that of a story familiar to children  harmonised well with the droll placard which announced its delivery   the place and time were notified on a slip pasted beneath   to emerge from the dull depths of lyceum committees and launch out as a showman lecturer on his own responsibility  was something both novel and bold for artemus to do   in the majority of instances he or his agent met with speculators who were ready to engage him for so many lectures  and secure to the lecturer a certain fixed sum   but in his later transactions artemus would have nothing to do with them  much preferring to undertake all the risk himself   the last speculator to whom he sold himself for a tour was  i believe  mr  wilder  of new york city  who realised a large profit by investing in lecturing stock  and who was always ready to engage a circus  a wild beast show  or a lecturing celebrity   as a rule artemus ward succeeded in pleasing every one in his audience  especially those who understood the character of the man and the drift of his lecture  but there were not wanting at any of his lectures a few obtuse minded  slowly perceptive  drowsy headed dullards  who had not the remotest idea what the entertainer was talking about  nor why those around him indulged in laughter  artemus was quick to detect these little spots upon the sunny face of his auditory   he would pick them out  address himself at times to them especially  and enjoy the bewilderment of his boeotian patrons   sometimes a stolid inhabitant of central new york  evidently of dutch extraction  would regard him with an open stare expressive of a desire to enjoy that which was said if the point of the joke could by any possibility be indicated to him   at other times a demure pennsylvania quaker would benignly survey the poor lecturer with a look of benevolent pity  and on one occasion  when my friend was lecturing at peoria  an elderly lady  accompanied by her two daughters  left the room in the midst of the lecture  exclaiming  as she passed me at the door   it is too bad of people to laugh at a poor young man who doesn t know what he is saying  and ought to be sent to a lunatic asylum    the newspaper reporters were invariably puzzled in attempting to give any correct idea of a lecture by artemus ward   no report could fairly convey an idea of the entertainment  and being fully aware of this  artemus would instruct his agent to beg of the papers not to attempt giving any abstract of that which he said   the following is the way in which the reporter of the golden era  at san francisco  california  endeavoured to inform the san franciscan public of the character of  the babes in the wood  lecture   it is  as the reader will perceive  a burlesque on the way in which artemus himself dealt with the topic he had chosen  while it also notes one or two of the salient features of my friend s style of lecturing    how artemus ward  spoke a piece      artemus has arrived   artemus has spoken   artemus has triumphed  great is artemus    great also is platt s hall   but artemus is greater  for the hall proved too small for his audience  and too circumscribed for the immensity of his jokes   a man who has drank twenty bottles of wine may be called  full    a pint bottle with a quart of water in it would also be accounted full  and so would an hotel be  every bed in it let three times over on the same night to three different occupants  but none of these would be so full as platt s hall was on friday night to hear artemus ward  speak a piece     the piece selected was  the babes in the wood   which reminds us that mr  ward is a tall  slender built  fair complexioned  jovial looking gentleman of about twenty seven years of age   he has a pleasant manner  an agreeable style  and a clear  distinct  and powerful voice     the babes in the wood  is a  comic oration   with a most comprehensive grasp of subject   as spoken by its witty author  it elicited gusto of laughter and whirlwinds of applause   mr  ward is no prosy lyceum lecturer   his style is neither scientific  didactic  or philosophical   it is simply that of a man who is brimful of mirth  wit  and satire  and who is compelled to let it flow forth   maintaining a very grave countenance himself  he plays upon the muscles of other people s faces as though they were piano  strings  and he the prince of pianists    the story of  the babes in the wood  is interesting in the extreme  we would say  en passant  however  that artemus ward is a perfect steam factory of puns and a museum of american humour   humanity seems to him to be a vast mine  out of which he digs tons of fun  and life a huge forest  in which he can cut down  cords  of comicality   language with him is like the brass balls with which the juggler amuses us at the circus  ever being tossed up  ever glittering  ever thrown about at pleasure   we intended to report his lecture in full  but we laughed till we split our lead pencil  and our shorthand symbols were too infused with merriment to remain steady on the paper   however  let us proceed to give an idea of  the babes in the wood    in the first place  it is a comic oration  that is  it is spoken  is exuberant in fun  felicitous in fancy  teeming with jokes  and sparkling as bright waters on a sunny day  the  babes in the wood  is  that is  it isn t a lecture or an oratorical effort  it is something sui generis  something reserved for our day and generation  which it would never have done for our forefathers to have known  or they would have been too mirthful to have attended to the business of preparing the world for our coming  and something which will provoke so much laughter in our time  that the echo of the laughs will reverberate along the halls of futurity  and seriously affect the nerves of future generations    the  babes in the wood   to describe it  is  well  those who listened to it know best   at any rate  they will acknowledge with us that it was a great success  and that artemus ward has a fortune before him in california    and now to tell the story of  the babes in the wood   but we will not  for the hall was not half large enough to accommodate those who came  consequently mr  ward will tell it over again at the metropolitan theatre next tuesday evening   the subject will again be  the babes in the wood     having travelled over the union with  the babes in the wood  lecture  and left his audiences everywhere fully  in the wood  as regarded the subject announced in the title  artemus ward became desirous of going over the same ground again   there were not wanting dreary and timid prophets who told him that having  sold  his audiences once  he would not succeed in gaining large houses a second time   but the faith of artemus in the unsuspecting nature of the public was very large  so with fearless intrepidity he conceived the happy thought of inventing a new title  but keeping to the same old lecture  interspersing it here and there with a few fresh jokes  incidental to new topics of the times   just at this period general mcclellan was advancing on richmond  and the celebrated fight at bull s run had become matter of history   the forcible abolition of slavery had obtained a place among the debates of the day  hinton rowan helper s book on  the inevitable crisis  had been sold at every bookstall  and the future of the negro had risen into the position of being the great point of discussion throughout the land  artemus required a very slender thread to string his jokes upon  and what better one could be found than that which he chose   he advertised the title of his next lecture as  sixty minutes in africa    i need scarcely say that he had never been in africa  and in all probability had never read a book on african travel   he knew nothing about it  and that was the very reason he should choose africa for his subject   i believe that he carried out the joke so far as to have a map made of the african continent  and that on a few occasions  but not on all  he had it suspended in the lecture room   it was in philadelphia and at the musical fund hall in locust street that i first heard him deliver what he jocularly phrased to me as  my african revelation    the hall was very thronged  the audience must have exceeded two thousand in number  and the evening was unusually warm   artemus came on the rostrum with a roll of paper in his hands  and used it to play with throughout the lecture  just as recently at the egyptian hall  while lecturing on the mormons  he invariably made use of a lady s riding  whip for the same purpose   he commenced his lecture thus  speaking very gravely and with long pauses between his sentences  allowing his audience to laugh if they pleased  but seeming to utterly disregard their laughter    i have invited you to listen to a discourse upon africa   africa is my subject   it is a very large subject   it has the atlantic ocean on its left side  the indian ocean on its right  and more water than you could measure out at its smaller end   africa produces blacks  ivory blacks  they get ivory   it also produces deserts  and that is the reason it is so much deserted by travellers   africa is famed for its roses   it has the red rose  the white rose  and the neg rose   apropos of negroes  let me tell you a little story    then he at once diverged from the subject of africa to retail to his audience his amusing story of the conversion of a negro  which he subsequently worked up into an article in the savage club papers  and entitled  converting the nigger    never once again in the course of the lecture did he refer to africa  until the time having arrived for him to conclude  and the people being fairly worn out with laughter  he finished up by saying   africa  ladies and gentlemen  is my subject   you wish me to tell you something about africa   africa is on the map  it is on all the maps of africa that i have ever seen   you may buy a good map for a dollar  and if you study it well  you will know more about africa than i do   it is a comprehensive subject  too vast  i assure you  for me to enter upon to night   you would not wish me to  i feel that  i feel it deeply  and i am very sensitive   if you go home and go to bed it will be better for you than to go with me to africa    the joke about the  neg rose  has since run the gauntlet of nearly all the minstrel bands throughout england and america   all the  bones   every  middle man   and all  end men  of the burnt cork profession have used artemus ward as a mine wherein to dig for the ore which provokes laughter   he has been the  cause of wit in others   and the bread winner for many dozens of black face songsters   singists  as he used to term them   he was just as fond of visiting their entertainments as they were of appropriating his jokes  and among his best friends in new york were the brothers messrs neil and dan bryant  who have made a fortune by what has been facetiously termed  the burnt cork opera    it was in his  sixty minutes in africa  lecture that artemus ward first introduced his celebrated satire on the negro  which he subsequently put into print    the african   said he   may be our brother   several highly respectable gentlemen and some talented females tell me that he is  and for argument s sake i might be induced to grant it  though i don t believe it myself   but the african isn t our sister  and wife  and uncle   he isn t several of our brothers and first wife s relations   he isn t our grandfather and great grandfather  and our aunt in the country   scarcely    it may easily be imagined how popular this joke became when it is remembered that it was first perpetrated at a time when the negro question was so much debated as to have become an absolute nuisance  nothing else was talked of  nobody would talk of anything but the negro   the saying arose that all americans had  nigger on the brain    the topic had become nauseous  especially to the democratic party  and artemus always had more friends among them than among the republicans   if he had any politics at all he was certainly a democrat   war had arisen  the south was closed  and the lecturing arena considerably lessened   artemus ward determined to go to california  before starting for that side of the american continent  he wished to appear in the city of new york   he engaged  through his friend mr  de walden  the large hall then known as niblo s  in front of the niblo s garden theatre  and now used  i believe  as the dining room of the metropolitan hotel   at that period pepper s ghost chanced to be the great novelty of new york city  and artemus ward was casting about for a novel title to his old lecture   whether he or mr  de walden selected that of  artemus ward s struggle with a ghost  i do not know  but i think that it was mr  de walden s choice   the title was seasonable  and the lecture successful   then came the tour to california  whither i proceeded in advance to warn the miners on the yuba  the travellers on the rio sacramento  and the citizens of the chrysopolis of the pacific that  a  ward  would be there shortly  in california the lecture was advertised under its old name of  the babes in the wood    platt s hall was selected for the scene of operation  and  so popular was the lecturer  that on the first night we took at the doors more than sixteen hundred dollars in gold   the crowd proved too great to take money in the ordinary manner  and hats were used for people to throw their dollars in   one hat broke through at the crown   i doubt if we ever knew to a dollar how many dollars it once contained   california was duly travelled over  and  the babes in the wood  listened to with laughter in its flourishing cities  its mining camps among the mountains  and its  new placers beside gold bedded rivers   while journeying through that strangely  beautiful land  the serious question arose  what was to be done next   after california  where   before leaving new york  it had been a favourite scheme of artemus ward not to return from california to the east by way of panama  but to come home across the plains  and to visit salt lake city by the way   the difficulty that now presented itself was  that winter was close upon us  and that it was no pleasant thing to cross the sierra nevada and scale the rocky mountains with the thermometer far below freezingpoint   nor was poor artemus even at that time a strong man  my advice was to return to panama  visit the west india islands  and come back to california in the spring  lecture again in san francisco  and then go on to the land of the mormons   artemus doubted the feasibility of this plan  and the decision was ultimately arrived at to try the journey to salt lake   unfortunately the winter turned out to be one of the severest   when we arrived at salt lake city  my poor friend was seized with typhoid fever  resulting from the fatigue we had undergone  the intense cold to which we had been subjected  and the excitement of being on a journey of 3500 miles across the north american continent  when the pacific railway had made little progress and the indians were reported not to be very friendly   the story of the trip is told in artemus ward s lecture   i have added to it  at the special request of the publisher  a few explanatory notes  the purport of which is to render the reader acquainted with the characteristics of the lecturer s delivery   for the benefit of those who never had an opportunity of seeing artemus ward nor of hearing him lecture  i may be pardoned for attempting to describe the man himself   in stature he was tall  in figure  slender   at any time during our acquaintance his height must have been disproportionate to his weight   like his brother cyrus  who died a few years before him  charles f  browne  our  artemus ward   had the premonitory signs of a short life strongly evident in his early manhood   there were the lank form  the long pale fingers  the very white pearly teeth  the thin  fine  soft hair  the undue brightness of the eyes  the excitable and even irritable disposition  the capricious appetite  and the alternately jubilant and despondent tone of mind which too frequently indicate that  the abhorred fury with the shears  is waiting too near at hand to  slit the thin spun life    his hair was very light colored  and not naturally curly   he used to joke in his lecture about what it cost him to keep it curled  he wore a very large moustache without any beard or whiskers  his nose was exceedingly prominent  having an outline not unlike that of the late sir charles napier   his forehead was large  with  to use the language of the phrenologists  the organs of the perceptive faculties far more developed than those of the imaginative powers  he had the manner and bearing of a naturally born gentleman   great was the disappointment of many who  having read his humorous papers descriptive of his exhibition of snakes and waxwork  and who having also formed their ideas of him from the absurd pictures which had been attached to some editions of his works  found on meeting with him that there was no trace of the showman in his deportment  and little to call up to their mind the smart yankee who had married  betsy jane    there was nothing to indicate that he had not lived a long time in europe and acquired the polish which men gain by coming in contact with the society of european capitals   in his conversation there was no marked peculiarity of accent to identify him as an american  nor any of the braggadocio which some of his countrymen unadvisedly assume   his voice was soft  gentle  and clear   he could make himself audible in the largest lecture rooms without effort   his style of lecturing was peculiar  so thoroughly sui generis  that i know of no one with whom to compare him  nor can any description very well convey an idea of that which it was like  however much he caused his audience to laugh  no smile appeared upon his own face   it was grave  even to solemnity  while he was giving utterance to the most delicious absurdities   his assumption of indifference to that which he was saying  his happy manner of letting his best jokes fall from his lips as if unconscious of their being jokes at all  his thorough self possession on the platform  and keen appreciation of that which suited his audience and that which did not  rendered him well qualified for the task which he had undertaken  that of amusing the public with a humorous lecture   he understood and comprehended to a hair s breadth the grand secret of how not to bore   he had weighed  measured  and calculated to a nicety the number of laughs an audience could indulge in on one evening  without feeling that they were laughing just a little too much   above all  he was no common man  and did not cause his audience to feel that they were laughing at that which they should feel ashamed of being amused with   he was intellectually up to the level of nine tenths of those who listened to him  and in listening  they felt that it was no fool who wore the cap and bells so excellently   it was amusing to notice how with different people his jokes produced a different effect   the honourable robert lowe attended one evening at the mormon lecture  and laughed as hilariously as any one in the room   the next evening mr  john bright happened to be present   with the exception of one or two occasional smiles  he listened with grave attention   in placing the lecture before the public in print  it is impossible  by having recourse to any system of punctuation  to indicate the pauses  jerky emphases  and odd inflexions of voice which characterised the delivery   the reporter of the standard newspaper  describing his first lecture in london  aptly said   artemus dropped his jokes faster than the meteors of last night succeeded each other in the sky   and there was this resemblance between the flashes of his humour and the flights of the meteors  that in each case one looked for jokes or meteors  but they always came just in the place that one least expected to find them   half the enjoyment of the evening lay  to some of those present  in listening to the hearty cachinnation of the people who only found out the jokes some two or three minutes after they were made  and who then laughed apparently at some grave statements of fact   reduced to paper  the showman s jokes are certainly not brilliant  almost their whole effect lies in their seemingly impromptu character   they are carefully led up to  of course  but they are uttered as if they are mere afterthoughts  of which the speaker is hardly sure    herein the writer in the standard hits the most marked peculiarity of artemus ward s style of lecturing   his affectation of not knowing what he was uttering  his seeming fits of abstraction  and his grave  melancholy aspect  constituted the very cream of the entertainment   occasionally he would amuse himself in an apparently meditative mood  by twirling his little riding whip  or by gazing earnestly  but with affected admiration  at his panorama   at the egyptian hall his health entirely failed him  and he would occasionally have to use a seat during the course of the lecture   in the notes which follow i have tried  i know how inefficiently  to convey here and there an idea of how artemus rendered his lecture amusing by gesture or action   i have also  at the request of the publisher  made a few explanatory comments on the subject of our mormon trip   in so doing i hope that i have not thrust myself too prominently forward  nor been too officious in my explanations   my aim has been to add to the interest of the lecture with those who never heard it delivered  and to revive in the memory of those who did some of its notable peculiarities   the illustrations are from photographs of the panorama painted in america for artemus  as the pictorial portion of his entertainment   in the lecture is the fun of the journey   for the hard facts the reader in quest of information is referred to a book published previously to the lecturer s appearance at the egyptian hall  the title of which is   artemus ward   his travels among the mormons   much against the grain as it was for artemus to be statistical  he has therein detailed some of the experiences of his mormon trip  with due regard to the exactitude and accuracy of statement expected by information seeking readers in a book of travels   he was not precisely the sort of traveller to write a paper for the evening meetings of the royal geographical society  nor was he sufficiently interested in philosophical theories to speculate on the developments of mormonism as illustrative of the history of religious belief   we were looking out of the window of the salt lake house one morning  when brigham young happened to pass down the opposite side of main street   it was cold weather  and the prophet was clothed in a thick cloak of some green colored material   i remarked to artemus that brigham had seemingly compounded mormonism from portions of a dozen different creeds  and that in selecting green for the color of his apparel  he was imitating mahomet    has it not struck you   i observed   that swedenborgianism and mahometanism are oddly blended in the mormon faith     petticoatism and plunder   was artemus s reply  and that comprehended his whole philosophy of mormonism   as he remarked elsewhere    brigham young is a man of great natural ability   if you ask me  how pious is he  i treat it as a conundrum  and give it up    to lecture in london  and at the egyptian hall  had long been a favourite idea of artemus ward   some humorist has said  that  all good americans  when they die    go to paris    so do most  whether good or bad  while they are living   still more strongly developed is the transatlantic desire to go to rome   in the far west of the missouri  in the remoter west of colorado and away in far north western oregon  i have heard many a tradesman express his intention to make dollars enough to enable him to visit rome   in a land where all is so new  where they have had no past  where an old wall would be a sensation  and a tombstone of anybody s great grandfather the marvel of the whole region  the charms of the old world have an irresistible fascination   to visit the home of the caesars they have read of in their school books  and to look at architecture which they have seen pictorially  but have nothing like it in existence around them  is very naturally the strong wish of people who are nationally nomadic  and who have all more or less a smattering of education   artemus ward never expressed to me any very great wish to travel on the european continent  but to see london was to accomplish something which he had dreamed of from his boyhood   there runs from marysville in california to oroville in the same state a short and singular little railway  which  when we were there  was in a most unfinished condition   to oroville we were going   we were too early for the train at the marysville station  and sat down on a pile of timber to chat over future prospects    what sort of a man was albert smith   asked artemus  and do you think that the mormons would be as good a subject for the londoners as mont blanc was    i answered his questions   he reflected for a few moments  and then said    well  old fellow  i ll tell you what i should like to do   i should like to go to london and give my lecture in the same place   can it be done    it was done   not in the same room  but under the same roof and on the same floor  in that gloomy looking hall in piccadilly  which was destined to be the ante chamber to the tomb of both lecturers   throughout this brief sketch i have written familiarly of the late mr  charles f  browne as  artemus ward   or simply as  artemus    i have done so advisedly  mainly because  during the whole course of our acquaintance  i do not remember addressing him as  mr  browne   or by his real christian name   to me he was always  artemus    artemus the kind  the gentle  the suave  the generous   one who was ever a friend in the fullest meaning of the word  and the best of companions in the amplest acceptance of the phrase   his merry laugh and pleasant conversation are as audible to me as if they were heard but yesterday  his words of kindness linger on the ear of memory  and his tones of genial mirth live in echoes which i shall listen to for evermore   two years will soon have passed away since last he spoke  and              silence now  enamour d of his voice             looks its mute music in her rugged cell                                                e p  hingston  london  october 1868             artemus

eyes up tords the sealin and sed    you re a man of sin    he then walkt out of the room   jest then the female in the meal bag stuck her hed into the room and statid that refreshments awaited the weary travler  and i sed if it was vittles she ment the weary travler was agreeable  and i follored her into the next room   i sot down to the table and the female in the meal bag pored out sum tea   she sed nothin  and for five minutes the only live thing in that room was a old wooden clock  which tickt in a subdood and bashful manner in the corner   this dethly stillness made me oneasy  and i determined to talk to the female or bust  so sez i   marrige is agin your rules  i bleeve  marm     yay     the sexes liv strickly apart  i spect     yay     it s kinder singler   sez i  puttin on my

commenst pickin my teeth with a fork   the female went out  leavin me all alone with the clock   i hadn t sot thar long before the elder poked his hed in at the door    you re a man of sin   he sed  and groaned and went away   direckly thar cum in two young shakeresses  as putty and slick lookin gals as i ever met   it is troo they was drest in meal bags like the old one i d met previsly  and their shiny  silky har was hid from sight by long white caps  sich as i spose female josts wear  but their eyes sparkled like diminds  their cheeks was like roses  and they was charmin enuff to make a man throw stuns at his granmother if they axed him to   they comenst clearin away the dishes  castin shy glances at me all the time  i got excited   i forgot betsy jane in my rapter  and sez i   my

for others  the accommodation being a mutual benefit   for one issoo  and i thawt i d ride up to the next town on a little jaunt  to rest my branes  which had bin severely rackt by my mental efforts    this is sorter ironical    so i went over to the rale road offiss and axed the sooprintendent for a pars    you a editer   he axed  evijently on the pint of snickerin    yes sir   sez i   don t i

this way   undertakes to smooth the thing over to otheller  who rushes in with a drawn sword   wants to know what s up   iago cunningly tells his story    otheller tells mike that he thinks a good deal of him  but he can t train no more in his regiment   desdemony sympathizes with poor mike   interceeds for him with otheller   iago makes him bleeve she does this because she thinks more of mike than she does of hisself   otheller swallers iago s lyin tail   goes to makin a noosence of hisself ginrally   he worries poor desdemony terrible by his vile insinuations    finally smothers her to

there are several reports afloat as to how  honest old abe  received the news of his nomination  none of which are correct   we give the correct report   the official committee arrived in springfield at dewy eve  and went to honest old abe s house   honest old abe was not in   mrs  honest old abe said honest old abe was out in the woods splitting rails  so the official committee went out into the woods  where sure enough they found honest old abe splitting rails with his two boys  it was a grand  a magnificent spectacle   there stood honest old abe in his shirt sleeves  a pair of leather home made suspenders holding up a pair of home made pantaloons  the seat of which was neatly patched with substantial cloth of a different color    mr lincoln  sir  you ve been nominated  sir  for the highest office  sir       oh  don t bother me   said honest old abe   i took a stent this mornin  to split three million rails afore night  and i don t want to be pestered with no stuff about no conventions till i get my stent done   i ve only got two hundred thousand rails to split before sundown   i kin do it if you ll let me alone    and the great man went right on splitting rails  paying no attention to the committee whatever   the committee were lost in admiration for a few moments  when they recovered  and asked one of honest old abe s boys whose boy he was    i m my parent s boy   shouted the urchin  which burst of wit so convulsed the committee that they came very near  gin in eout  completely   in a few moments honest ole abe finished his task  and received the news with perfect self possession  he then asked them up to the house  where he received them cordially   he said he split three million rails every day  although he was in very poor health   mr  lincoln is a jovial man  and has a keen sense of the ludicrous   during the evening he asked mr  evarts  of new york   why chicago was like a hen crossing the street    mr  evarts gave it up    because   said mr  lincoln   old grimes is dead  that good old man    this exceedingly humorous thing created the most uproarious laughter    1 31   interview with president lincoln   i hav no politics   not a one   i m

has probly fallen into the hands of sum dealer in 2nd hand close  who can t sell it   leastways nobody pears to be goin round wearin it to any perticler extent  now days   the rigiment of whom i was kurnel  finerly concluded they was better adapted as home gards  which accounts for your not hearin of me  ear this  where the bauls is the thickest and where the cannon doth roar   but as a american citizen i shall never cease to admire the masterly advance our troops made on washinton from bull run  a short time ago   it was well dun   i spoke to my wife  bout it at the time   my wife sed it was well dun   it havin there4 bin detarmined to pertect baldinsville at all hazzuds  and as there was no apprehensions of any immejit danger  i thought i would go orf onto a pleasure tower   accordinly i put on a clean biled shirt and started for washinton   i went there to see the prints napoleon  and not to see the place  which i will here take occasion to obsarve is about as uninterestin a locality as there is this side of j  davis s future home  if he ever does die  and where i reckon they ll make it so warm for him that he will si for his summer close   it is easy enough to see why a man goes to the poor house or the penitentiary   it s becawz he can t help it  but why he should woluntarily go and live in washinton  is intirely beyond my comprehension  and i can t say no fairer nor that   i put up to a leadin hotel   i saw the landlord and sed   how d ye do  square     fifty cents  sir   was his reply    sir     half a dollar   we charge twenty five cents for lookin at the landlord and fifty cents for speakin to him   if you want supper  a boy will show you to the dinin room for twenty five cents   your room bein in the tenth story  it will cost you a dollar to be shown up there     how much do you ax for a man breathin in this equinomikal tarvun   sed i    ten cents a breth   was his reply   washinton hotels is very reasonable in their charges    n b   this is sarkassum    i

sed the emperor was well   eugeny was likewise well  he sed   then i axed him was lewis a good provider  did he cum home arly nites  did he perfoom her bedroom at a onseasonable hour with gin and tanzy   did he go to  the lodge  on nites when there wasn t any lodge  did he often hav to go down town to meet a friend  did he hav a extensiv acquaintance among poor young widders whose husbands was in californy  to all of which questions the prints perlitely replide  givin me to understand that the emperor was behavin well    i ax these question  my royal duke and most noble hiness and imperials  becaws i m anxious to know how he stands as a man   i know he s smart   he is cunnin  he is long heded  he is deep  he is grate   but onless he is good he ll come down with a crash one of these days and the bonyparts will be bustid up agin   bet yer life     air you a preacher  sir   he inquired slitely sarkasticul    no  sir   but i bleeve in morality   i likewise bleeve in meetin houses   show

where gates have no hinges  where the wimin are slipshod  and where maps of the devil s  wild land  air painted upon men s shirt bosums with tobacco jooce   that s what i ll show you   let us consider what the preachers do for us before we aboose  em    he sed he didn t mean to aboose the clergy   not at all  and he was happy to see that i was interested in the bonypart family    it s a grate family   sed i   but they scooped the old man in     how  sir     napoleon the grand   the britishers scooped him at waterloo   he wanted to do too much  and he did it   they scooped him in at waterloo  and he subsekently died at st  heleny   there s where the gratest military man this world ever projuced pegged out   it was rather hard to consine such a man as him to st  heleny  to spend his larst days in catchin mackeril  and walkin up and down the dreary beach in a military cloak drawn titely round him   see picter books   but so it was    hed of the army    them was his larst words   so he had bin   he was grate   don t i wish we had a pair of his old boots to command sum of our brigades    this pleased jerome  and he took me warmly by the hand    alexander the grate was punkins   i continnered   but napoleon was punkinser   alic wept becaws there was no more worlds to scoop  and then took to drinkin   he drowndid his sorrers in the flowin bole  and the flowin bole was too much for him   it ginerally is   he undertook to give a snake exhibition in his boots  but it killed him   that was a bad joke on alic     since you air so solicitous about france and the emperor  may i ask you how your own country is getting along   sed jerome  in a pleasant voice    it s mixed   i sed   but i think we shall cum out all right     columbus  when he diskivered this magnificent continent  could hav had no idee of the grandeur it would one day assoom   sed the prints    it cost columbus twenty thousand dollars to fit out his explorin expedition   sed i    if he had bin a sensible man he d hav put the money in a hoss railroad or a gas company  and left this magnificent continent to intelligent savages  who when they got hold of a good thing knew enuff to keep it  and who wouldn t hav seceded  nor rebelled  nor knockt liberty in the hed with a slungshot   columbus wasn t much of a feller  after all   it would hav bin money in my pocket if he d staid at home   chris  ment well  but he put his foot in it when he saled for america    we talked sum more about matters and things  and at larst i riz to go    i will now say good bye to you  noble sir  and good luck to you   likewise the same to clotildy   also to the gorgeous persons which compose your soot   if the emperor s boy don t like livin at the tooleries  when he gits older  and would like to imbark in the show bizness  let him come with me and i ll make a man of him   you find us sumwhat mixed  as i before obsarved  but come again next year and you ll find us clearer nor ever   the american eagle has lived too sumptuously of late  his stummic becum foul  and he s takin a slite emetic   that s all   we re getting ready to strike a big blow and a sure one   when we do strike  the fur will fly and secession will be in the hands of the undertaker  sheeted for so deep a grave that nothin short of gabriel s trombone will ever awaken it   mind what i say   you ve heard the showman    then advisin him to keep away from the peter funk sections of the east  and the proprietors of corner lots in the west  i bid him farewell  and went away   there was a levee at senator what s his name s  and i thought i d jine in the festivities for a spell   who should i see but she that was sarah watkins  now the wife of our congresser  trippin in the dance  dressed up to kill in her store close   sarah s father use to keep a little grosery store in our town and she used to clerk it for him in busy times   i was rushin up to shake hands with her when she turned on her heel  and tossin her hed in a contemptooious manner  walked away from me very rapid    hallo  sal   i hollered   can t you measure me a quart of them best melasses   i may want a codfish  also    i guess this reminded her of the little red store  and  the days of her happy childhood    but i fell in love with a nice little gal after that  who was much sweeter then sally s father s melasses  and i axed her if we shouldn t glide in the messy dance   she sed we should  and we glode   i intended to make this letter very seris  but a few goaks may have accidentally crept in   never mind   besides  i think it improves a komick paper to publish a goak once in a while                                      yours muchly                                                  ward   artemus     1 33   agriculture   the barclay county agricultural society having seriously invited the author of this volume to address them on the occasion of their next annual fair  he wrote the president of that society as follows                                            new york   june 12  1865   dear sir     i have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th inst   in which you invite me to deliver an address before your excellent agricultural society   i feel flattered  and think i will come   perhaps  meanwhile  a brief history of my experience as an agriculturist will be acceptable  and as that history no doubt contains suggestions of value to the entire agricultural community  i have concluded to write to you through the press   i have been an honest old farmer for some four years   my farm is in the interior of maine   unfortunately my lands are eleven miles from the railroad   eleven miles is quite a distance to haul immense quantities of wheat  corn  rye  and oats  but as i hav n t any to haul  i do not  after all  suffer much on that account   my farm is more especially a grass farm   my neighbors told me so at first  and as an evidence that they were sincere in that opinion  they turned their cows on to it the moment i went off  lecturing    these cows are now quite fat   i take pride in these cows  in fact  and am glad i own a grass farm   two years ago i tried sheep raising   i bought fifty lambs  and turned them loose on my broad and beautiful acres   it was pleasant on bright mornings to stroll leisurely out on to the farm in my dressing gown  with a cigar in my mouth  and watch those innocent little lambs as they danced gayly o er the hillside  watching their saucy capers reminded me of caper sauce  and it occurred to me i should have some very fine eating when they grew up to be  muttons    my gentle shepherd  mr  eli perkins  said   we must have some shepherd dogs    i had no very precise idea as to what shepherd dogs were  but i assumed a rather profound look  and said    we must  eli   i spoke to you about this some time ago    i wrote to my old friend  mr  dexter h  follett  of boston  for two shepherd dogs   mr  f  is not an honest old farmer himself  but i thought he knew about shepherd dogs   he kindly forsook far more important business to accommodate  and the dogs came forthwith  they were splendid creatures  snuff colored  hazel eyed  long tailed  and shapely jawed   we led them proudly to the fields    turn them in  eli   i said   eli turned them in   they went in at once  and killed twenty of my best lambs in about four minutes and a half   my friend had made a trifling mistake in the breed of these dogs   these dogs were not partial to sheep   eli perkins was astonished  and observed    waal  did you ever    i certainly never had   there were pools of blood on the greensward  and fragments of wool and raw lamb chops lay round in confused heaps   the dogs would have been sent to boston that night  had they not suddenly died that afternoon of a throat distemper   it wasn t a swelling of the throat   it wasn t diptheria   it was a violent opening of the throat  extending from ear to ear   thus closed their life stories   thus ended their interesting tails   i failed as a raiser of lambs   as a sheepist  i was not a success   last summer mr  perkins  said   i think we d better cut some grass this season  sir    we cut some grass   to me the new mown hay is very sweet and nice   the brilliant george arnold sings about it  in beautiful verse  down in jersey every summer  so does the brilliant aldrich  at portsmouth  n h  and yet i doubt if either of these men knows the price of a ton of hay to day   but new mown hay is a really fine thing   it is good for man and beast   we hired four honest farmers to assist us  and i led them gayly to the meadows   i was going to mow  myself   i saw the sturdy peasants go round once ere i dipped my flashing scythe into the tall green grass    are you ready   said e  perkins    i am here     then follow us    i followed them   followed them rather too closely  evidently  for a white haired old man  who immediately followed mr  perkins  called upon us to halt  then in a low firm voice he said to his son  who was just ahead of me   john  change places with me   i hain t got long to live  anyhow   yonder berryin  ground will soon have these old bones  and it s no matter whether i m carried there with one leg off and ter ble gashes in the other or not   but you  john  you are young    the old man changed places with his son   a smile of calm resignation lit up his wrinkled face  as he sed   now  sir  i am ready     what mean you  old man   i sed    i mean that if you continner to bran ish that blade as you have been bran ishin  it  you ll slash h   out of some of us before we re a hour older    there was some reason mingled with this white haired old peasant s profanity   it was true that i had twice escaped mowing off his son s legs  and his father was perhaps naturally alarmed   i went and sat down under a tree    i never know d a literary man in my life   i overheard the old man say   that know d anything    mr  perkins was not as valuable to me this season as i had fancied he might be   every afternoon he disappeared from the field regularly  and remained about some two hours   he sed it was headache   he inherited it from his mother   his mother was often taken in that way  and suffered a great deal   at the end of the two hours mr  perkins would reappear with his head neatly done up in a large wet rag  and say he  felt better    one afternoon it so happened that i soon followed the invalid to the house  and as i neared the porch i heard a female voice energetically observe   you stop    it was the voice of the hired girl  and she added   i ll holler for mr  brown     oh no  nancy   i heard the invalid e  perkins soothingly say   mr  brown knows i love you   mr  brown approves of it    this was pleasant for mr  brown   i peered cautiously through the kitchen blinds  and  however unnatural it may appear  the lips of eli perkins and my hired girl were very near together   she sed   you shan t do so   and he do soed   she also said she would get right up and go away  and as an evidence that she was thoroughly in earnest about it  she remained where she was   they are married now  and mr  perkins is troubled no more with the headache   this year we are planting corn   mr  perkins writes me that  on accounts of no skare krows bein put up krows cum and digged fust crop up but soon got nother in   old bisbee who was frade youd cut his sons leggs off ses you bet go an stan up in feeld yrself with dressin gownd on   gesses krows will keep way   this made boys in store larf   no more terday from                           yours                                 respecful                                            eli perkins                           his letter    my friend mr  d t t  moore  of the  rural new yorker   thinks if i  keep on  i will get in the poor house in about two years   if you think the honest old farmers of barclay county want me  i will come                                truly yours                                              charles f  browne    1 34   busts   there are in this city several italian gentlemen engaged in the bust business   they have their peculiarities and eccentricities   they are swarthy faced  wear slouched caps and drab pea jackets  and smoke bad cigars   they make busts of webster  clay  bonaparte  douglas  and other great men  living and dead   the italian buster comes upon you solemnly and cautiously    buy napoleon   he will say  and you may probably answer  not a buy     how much giv ee   he asks  and perhaps you will ask him how much he wants    nine dollar   he will answer always   we are sure of it   we have observed this peculiarity in the busters frequently   no matter how large or small the bust may be  the first price is invariably  nine dollar    if you decline paying this price  as you undoubtedly will if you are right in your head  he again asks   how much giv ee    by way of a joke you say  a dollar   when the buster retreats indignantly to the door  saying in a low  wild voice   o dam    with his hand upon the door latch  he turns and once more asks   how much giv ee    you repeat the previous offer  when he mutters   o ha   then coming pleasantly towards you  he speaks thus    say  how much giv ee    again you say a dollar  and he cries   take  um  take  um    thus falling eight dollars on his original price   very eccentric is the italian buster  and sometimes he calls his busts by wrong names   we bought webster  he called him web star  of him the other day  and were astonished when he called upon us the next day with another bust of webster  exactly like the one we had purchased of him  and asked us if we didn t want to buy  cole  the wife pizener    we endeavored to rebuke the depraved buster  but our utterance was choked  and we could only gaze upon him in speechless astonishment and indignation    1 35   a hard case   we have heard of some very hard cases since we have enlivened this world with our brilliant presence   we once saw an able bodied man chase a party of little school children and rob them of their dinners   the man who stole the coppers from his deceased grandmother s eyes lived in our neighborhood  and we have read about the man who went to church for the sole purpose of stealing the testaments and hymn books   but the hardest case we ever heard of lived in arkansas   he was only fourteen years old   one night he deliberately murdered his father and mother in cold blood  with a meat axe   he was tried and found guilty   the judge drew on his black cap  and in a voice choked with emotion asked the young prisoner if he had anything to say before the sentence of the court was passed on him   the court room was densely crowded and there was not a dry eye in the vast assembly   the youth of the prisoner  his beauty and innocent looks  the mild  lamblike manner in which he had conducted himself during the trial  all  all had thoroughly enlisted the sympathy of the spectators  the ladies in particular   and even the jury  who had found it to be their stern duty to declare him guilty of the appalling crime  even the jury now wept aloud at this awful moment    have you anything to say   repeated the deeply moved judge    why  no   replied the prisoner   i think i haven t  though i hope yer honor will show some consideration for the feelings of a poor orphan    the judge sentenced the perfect young wretch without delay    1 36   affairs around the village green   it isn t every one who has a village green to write about   i have one  although i have not seen much of it for some years past   i am back again  now   in the language of the duke who went around with a motto about him   i am here   and i fancy i am about as happy a peasant of the vale as ever garnished a melodrama  although i have not as yet danced on my village green  as the melodramatic peasant usually does on his   it was the case when rosina meadows left home   the time rolls by serenely now  so serenely that i don t care what time it is  which is fortunate  because my watch is at present in the hands of those  men of new york who are called rioters    we met by chance  the usual way  certainly not by appointment  and i brought the interview to a close with all possible despatch  assuring them that i wasn t mr  greeley  particularly  and that he had never boarded in the private family where i enjoy the comforts of a home  i tendered them my watch  and begged they would distribute it judiciously among the laboring classes  as i had seen the rioters styled in certain public prints   why should i loiter feverishly in broadway  stabbing the hissing hot air with the splendid gold headed cane that was presented to me by the citizens of waukegan  illinois  as a slight testimonial of their esteem   why broil in my rooms   you said to me  mrs  gloverson  when i took possession of these rooms  that no matter how warm it might be  a breeze had a way of blowing into them  and that they were  withal  quite countryfied  but i am bound to say  mrs  gloverson  that there was nothing about them that ever reminded me  in the remotest degree  of daisies or new mown hay   thus  with sarcasm  do i smash the deceptive gloverson   why stay in new york when i had a village green   i gave it up  the same as i would an intricate conundrum  and  in short  i am here   do i miss the glare and crash of the imperial thoroughfare   the milkman  the fiery  untamed omnibus horses  the soda fountains  central park  and those things   yes i do  and i can go on missing  em for quite a spell  and enjoy it   the village from which i write to you is small   it does not contain over forty houses  all told  but they are milk white  with the greenest of blinds  and for the most part are shaded with beautiful elms and willows   to the right of us is a mountain  to the left a lake   the village nestles between   of course it does  i never read a novel in my life in which the villages didn t nestle   villages invariably nestle   it is a kind of way they have   we are away from the cars   the iron horse  as my little sister aptly remarks in her composition on nature  is never heard to shriek in our midst  and on the whole i am glad of it   the villagers are kindly people   they are rather incoherent on the subject of the war  but not more so  perhaps  then are people elsewhere   one citizen  who used to sustain a good character  subscribed for the weekly new york herald a few months since  and went to studying the military maps in that well known journal for the fireside   i need not inform you that his intellect now totters  and he has mortgaged his farm   in a literary point of view we are rather bloodthirsty   a pamphlet edition of the life of a cheerful being  who slaughtered his wife and child  and then finished himself  is having an extensive sale just now   we know little of honore de balzac  and perhaps care less for victor hugo   m  claes s grand search for the absolute doesn t thrill us in the least  and jean valjean  gloomily picking his way through the sewers of paris  with the spooney young man of the name of marius upon his back  awakens no interest in our breasts   i say jean valjean picked his way gloomily  and i repeat it   no man  under these circumstances  could have skipped gayly   but this literary business  as the gentleman who married his colored chambermaid aptly observed   is simply a matter of taste    the store  i must not forget the store   it is an object of great interest to me   i usually encounter there  on sunny afternoons  an old revolutionary soldier   you may possibly have read about  another revolutionary soldier gone   but this is one who hasn t gone  and  moreover  one who doesn t manifest the slightest intention of going   he distinctly remembers washington  of course  they all do  but what i wish to call special attention to  is the fact that this revolutionary soldier is one hundred years old  that his eyes are so good that he can read fine print without spectacles   he never used them  by the way  and his mind is perfectly clear  he is a little shaky in one of his legs  but otherwise he is as active as most men of forty five  and his general health is excellent   he uses no tobacco  but for the last twenty years he has drunk one glass of liquor every day  no more  no less   he says he must have his tod   i had begun to have lurking suspicions about this revolutionary soldier business  but here is an original jacobs  but because a man can drink a glass of liquor a day  and live to be a hundred years old  my young readers must not infer that by drinking two glasses of liquor a day a man can live to be two hundred    which  i meanter say  it doesn t foller   as joseph gargery might observe   this store  in which may constantly be found calico and nails  and fish  and tobacco in kegs  and snuff in bladders  is a venerable establishment   as long ago as 1814 it was an institution   the county troops  on their way to the defence of portland  then menaced by british ships of war  were drawn up in front of this very store  and treated at the town s expense   citizens will tell you how the clergyman refused to pray for the troops  because he considered the war an unholy one  and how a somewhat eccentric person  of dissolute habits  volunteered his services  stating that he once had an uncle who was a deacon  and he thought he could make a tolerable prayer  although it was rather out of his line  and how he prayed so long and absurdly that the colonel ordered him under arrest  but that even while soldiers stood over him with gleaming bayonets  the reckless being sang a preposterous song about his grandmother s spotted calf  with its ri fol lol tiddery i do  after which he howled dismally   and speaking of the store  reminds me of a little story   the author of  several successful comedies  has been among us  and the store was anxious to know who the stranger was   and therefore the store asked him    what do you follow  sir   respectfully inquired the tradesman    i occasionally write for the stage  sir     oh   returned the tradesman  in a confused manner    he means   said an honest villager  with a desire to help the puzzled tradesman out   he means that he writes the handbills for the stage drivers    i believe that story is new  although perhaps it is not of an uproariously mirthful character  but one hears stories at the store that are old enough  goodness knows  stories which  no doubt  diverted methuselah in the sunny days of his giddy and thoughtless boyhood   there is an exciting scene at the store occasionally   yesterday an athletic peasant  in a state of beer  smashed in a counter and emptied two tubs of butter on the floor   his father  a white haired old man  who was a little boy when the revolutionary war closed  but who doesn t remember washington much  came round in the evening and settled for the damages    my son   he said   has considerable originality    i will mention that this same son once told me that he could lick me with one arm tied behind him  and i was so thoroughly satisfied he could  that i told him he needn t mind going for a rope   sometimes i go a visiting to a farmhouse  on which occasions the parlor is opened   the windows have been close shut ever since the last visitor was there  and there is a dingy smell that i struggle as calmly as possible with  until i am led to the banquet of steaming hot biscuit and custard pie   if they would only let me sit in the dear old fashioned kitchen  or on the door stone  if they knew how dismally the new black furniture looked  but  never mind  i am not a reformer   no  i should rather think not   gloomy enough  this living on a farm  you perhaps say  in which case you are wrong   i can t exactly say that i pant to be an agriculturist  but i do know that in the main it is an independent  calmly happy sort of life   i can see how the prosperous farmer can go joyously a field with the rise of the sun  and how his heart may swell with pride over bounteous harvests and sleek oxen   and it must be rather jolly for him on winter evenings to sit before the bright kitchen fire and watch his rosy boys and girls as they study out the charades in the weekly paper  and gradually find out why my first is something that grows in a garden  and my second is a fish   on the green hillside over yonder there is a quivering of snowy drapery  and bright hair is flashing in the morning sunlight   it is recess  and the seminary girls are running in the tall grass   a goodly seminary to look at outside  certainly  although i am pained to learn  as i do on unprejudiced authority  that mrs  higgins  the principal  is a tyrant  who seeks to crush the girls and trample upon them  but my sorrow is somewhat assuaged by learning that skimmerhorn  the pianist  is perfectly splendid   looking at these girls reminds me that i  too  was once young  and where are the friends of my youth   i have found one of  em  certainly   i saw him ride in the circus the other day on a bareback horse  and even now his name stares at me from yonder board fence  in green  and blue  and red  and yellow letters   dashington  the youth with whom i used to read the able orations of cicero  and who  as a declaimer on exhibition days  used to wipe the rest of us boys pretty handsomely out  well  dashington is identified with the halibut and cod interest  drives a fish cart  in fact  from a certain town on the coast  back into the interior   hurbertson  the utterly stupid boy  the lunkhead  who never had his lesson  he s about the ablest lawyer a sister state can boast   mills is a newspaper man  and is just now editing a major general down south   singlinson  the sweet voiced boy  whose face was always washed and who was real good  and who was never rude  he is in the penitentiary for putting his uncle s autograph to a financial document   hawkins  the clergyman s son  is an actor  and williamson  the good little boy who divided his bread and butter with the beggarman  is a failing merchant  and makes money by it   tom slink  who used to smoke short sixes and get acquainted with the little circus boys  is popularly supposed to be the proprietor of a cheap gaming establishment in boston  where the beautiful but uncertain prop is nightly tossed   be sure  the army is represented by many of the friends of my youth  the most of whom have given a good account of themselves   but chalmerson hasn t done much   no  chalmerson is rather of a failure   he plays on the guitar and sings love songs  not that he is a bad man   a kinder hearted creature never lived  and they say he hasn t yet got over crying for his little curly haired sister who died ever so long ago   but he knows nothing about business  politics  the world  and those things   he is dull at trade  indeed  it is a common remark that  everybody cheats chalmerson    he came to the party the other evening  and brought his guitar   they wouldn t have him for a tenor in the opera  certainly  for he is shaky in his upper notes  but if his simple melodies didn t gush straight from the heart  why were my trained eyes wet   and although some of the girls giggled  and some of the men seemed to pity him i could not help fancying that poor chalmerson was nearer heaven than any of us all    1 37   about editors   we hear a great deal  and something too much  about the poverty of editors  it is common for editors to parade their poverty and joke about it in their papers   we see these witticisms almost every day of our lives   sometimes the editor does the  vater vorks business   as mr  samuel weller called weeping  and makes pathetic appeals to his subscribers   sometimes he is in earnest when he makes these appeals  but why  on airth  does he stick to a business that will not support him decently   we read of patriotic and lofty minded individuals who sacrifice health  time  money  and perhaps life  for the good of humanity  the union  and that sort of thing  but we don t see them very often   we must say that we could count up all the lofty patriots in this line that we have ever seen  during our brief but chequered and romantic career  in less than half a day   a man who clings to a wretchedly paying business  when he can make himself and others near and dear to him fatter and happier by doing something else  is about as near an ass as possible  and not hanker after green grass and corn in the ear   the truth is  editors as a class are very well fed  groomed and harnessed   they have some pains that other folk do not have  and they also have some privileges which the community in general can t possess   while we would not advise the young reader to  go for an editor   we assure him he can do much worse   he mustn t spoil a flourishing blacksmith or popular victualler in making an indifferent editor of himself  however   he must be endowed with some fancy and imagination to enchain the public eye   it was smith  we believe  or some other man with an odd name  who thought shakespeare lacked the requisite fancy and imagination for a successful editor   to those persons who can t live by printing papers we would say  in the language of the profligate boarder when dunned for his bill  being told at the same time by the keeper of the house that he couldn t board people for nothing   then sell out to somebody who can    in other words  fly from a business which don t remunerate  but as we intimated before  there is much gammon in the popular editorial cry of poverty   just now we see a touching paragraph floating through the papers to the effect that editors don t live out half their years  that  poor souls  they wear themselves out for the benefit of a cold and unappreciating world   we don t believe it   gentle reader  don t swallow it   it is a footlight trick to work on your feelings   for ourselves  let us say  that unless we slip up considerably on our calculations  it will be a long time before our fellow citizens will have the melancholy pleasure of erecting to our memory a towering monument of parian marble on the public square    1 38   editing   before you go for an editor  young man  pause and take a big think  do not rush into the editorial harness rashly   look around and see if there is not an omnibus to drive  some soil somewhere to be tilled  a clerkship on some meat cart to be filled  anything that is reputable and healthy  rather than going for an editor  which is hard business at best   we are not a horse  and consequently have never been called upon to furnish the motive power for a threshing machine  but we fancy that the life of the editor who is forced to write  write  write  whether he feels right or not  is much like that of the steed in question  if the yeas and neighs could be obtained  we believe the intelligent horse would decide that the threshing machine is preferable to the sanctum editorial   the editor s work is never done   he is drained incessantly  and no wonder that he dries up prematurely   other people can attend banquets  weddings   c   visit halls of dazzling light  get inebriated  break windows  lick a man occasionally  and enjoy themselves in a variety of ways  but the editor cannot   he must stick tenaciously to his quill   the press  like a sick baby  mustn t be left alone for a minute   if the press is left to run itself even for a day  some absurd person indignantly orders the carrier boy to stop bringing  that infernal paper   there s nothing in it   i won t have it in the house    the elegant mantalini  reduced to mangle turning  described his life as  a dem d horrid grind    the life of the editor is all of that   but there is a good time coming  we feel confident  for the editor  a time when he will be appreciated   when he will have a front seat  when he will have pie every day  and wear store clothes continually  when the harsh cry of  stop my paper  will no more grate upon his ears   courage  messieurs the editors   still  sanguine as we are of the coming of this jolly time  we advise the aspirant for editorial honors to pause ere he takes up the quill as a means of obtaining his bread and butter   do not  at least  do so until you have been jilted several dozen times by a like number of girls  until you have been knocked down stairs several times and soused in a horse pond  until all the  gushing  feelings within you have been thoroughly subdued  until  in short  your hide is of rhinoceros thickness  then  o aspirants for the bubble reputation at the press s mouth  throw yourselves among the inkpots  dust  and cobwebs of the printing office  if you will              good my lord  will you see the editors well bestowed   do you hear  let them be well used  for they are the abstract and brief chroniclers of the time   after your death you had better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live                                             hamlet  slightly altered    1 39   popularity   what a queer thing

house  popularity is a queer thing  very   if you don t believe us  try it    1 40   a little difficulty in the way   an enterprising traveling agent for a well known cleveland tombstone manufactory lately made a business visit to a small town in an adjoining county   hearing  in the village  that a man in a remote part of the township had lost his wife  he thought he would go and see him  and offer him consolation and a gravestone  on his usual reasonable terms   he started   the road was a frightful one  but the agent persevered  and finally arrived at the bereaved man s house   bereaved man s hired girl told the agent that the bereaved man was splitting fence rails  over in pastur  about two milds   the indefatigable agent hitched his horse and started for the  pastur    after falling into all manner of mudholes  scratching himself with briers  and tumbling over decayed logs  the agent at length found the bereaved man   in a subdued voice he asked the man if he had lost his wife   the man said he had   the agent was very sorry to hear of it  and sympathized with the man deeply in his great affliction  but death  he said  was an insatiate archer  and shot down all  both of high and low degree   informed the man that  what was his loss was her gain   and would be glad to sell him a gravestone to mark the spot where the beloved one slept  marble or common stone  as he chose  at prices defying competition   the bereaved man said there was  a little difficulty in the way     haven t you lost your wife   inquired the agent    why  yes  i have   said the man   but no gravestun ain t necessary  you see the cussed critter ain t dead   she s scooted with another man    the agent retired    1 41   colored people s church   there is a plain little meeting house on barnwell street  one of the streets of the city of cleveland   in which the colored people  or a goodly portion of them  worship on sundays   the seats are cushionless  and have perpendicular backs   the pulpit is plain white  trimmed with red  it is true  but still a very unostentatious affair for colored people  who are supposed to have a decided weakness for gay hues   should you escort a lady to this church  and seat yourself beside her  you will infallibly be touched on the shoulder  and politely requested to move to the  gentlemen s side   gentlemen and ladies are not allowed to sit together in this church  they are parted remorselessly   it is hard  we may say it is terrible  to be torn asunder in this way  but you have to submit  and of course you had better do so gracefully and pleasantly   meeting opens with an old fashioned hymn  which is very well sung indeed by the congregation   then the minister reads a hymn  which is sung by the choir on the front seats near the pulpit   then the minister prays   he hopes no one has been attracted there by idle curiosity  to see or be seen  and you naturally conclude that he is gently hitting you   another hymn follows the prayer  and then we have the discourse  which certainly has the merit of peculiarity and boldness   the minister s name is jones   he don t mince matters at all   he talks about the  flames of hell  with a confident fierceness that must be quite refreshing to sinners    there s no half way about this   says he   no by paths    there are in cleveland lots of men who go to church regularly  who behave well in meeting  and who pay their bills    they ain t christians though    they re gentlemen sinners    and whar d ye spose they ll fetch up    i ll tell ye  they ll fetch him up in h  ll  and

modern spiritual movement  is in the city with his daughter  who is quite celebrated as a medium   they are accompanied by mr  eighme and his daughter  and are holding circles in hoffman s block every afternoon and evening   we were present at the circle last evening   miss davenport seated herself at a table on which was a tin trumpet  a tambourine  and a guitar   the audience were seated around the room  the lights were blown out  and the spirit of an eccentric individual  well known to the davenports  and whom they call george  addressed the audience through the trumpet   he called several of those present by name in a boisterous voice  and dealt several stunning knocks on the table   george has been in the spirit world some two hundred years   he is a rather rough spirit  and probably run with the machine and  killed for kyser  when in the flesh   kyser is an extensive new york butcher  and  to kill   or slaughter  for him has passed into a saying with the roughs  or  bhoys   of new york   to  run with a  fire  machine     he ordered the seats in the room to be wheeled round so the audience would face the table   he said the people on the front seat must be tied with a rope   the order was misunderstood  the rope being merely drawn before those on the front seat   he reprimanded mr  davenport for not understanding the instructions   what he meant was that the rope should be passed around each person on the front seat and then tightly drawn  a man at each end of the seat to hold on to it   this was done  and george expressed himself satisfied   there was no one near the table save the medium   all the rest were behind the rope  and those on the front seat were particularly charged not to let any one pass by them   george said he felt first rate  and commenced kissing the ladies present   the smack could be distinctly heard  and some of the ladies said the sensation was very natural   for the first time in our eventful life we sighed to be a spirit  we envied george   we did not understand whether the kissing was done through a trumpet   after kissing considerably  and indulging in some playful remarks with a man whose christian name was napoleon bonaparte  and whom george called  boney   he tied the hands and feet of the medium   he played the guitar and jingled the tambourine  and then dashed them violently on the floor   the candles were lit  and miss davenport was securely tied   she could not move her hands   her feet were bound  and the rope  which was a long one  was fastened to the chair   no person in the room had been near her or had anything to do with tying her   every person who was in the room will take his or her oath of that   she could hardly have tied herself   we never saw such intricate and thorough tying in our life   the believers present were convinced that george did it   the unbelievers didn t exactly know what to think about it  the candles were extinguished again  and pretty soon miss davenport told george to  don t    she spoke in an affrighted tone   the candles were lit  and she was discovered sitting on the table  hands and feet tied as before  and herself tied to the chair withal   the lights were again blown out  there were sounds as if some one was lifting her from the table  the candles were relit  and she was seen sitting in the chair on the floor again   no one had been near her from the audience   again the lights were extinguished  and presently the medium said her feet were wet   it appeared that the mischievous spirit of one biddie  an irish miss who died when twelve years old  had kicked over the water pail   miss eighme took a seat at the table  and the same mischievous biddie scissored off a liberal lock of her hair   there was the hair  and it had indisputably just been taken from miss eighme s head  and her hands and feet  like those of miss d   were securely tied   other things of a staggering character to the sceptic were done during the evening    1 43   mr  blowhard   the reader has probably met mr  blowhard   he is usually round   you find him in all public places   he is particularly  numerous  at shows   knows all the actors intimately   went to school with some of  em   knows how much they get a month to a cent  and how much liquor they can hold to a teaspoonful   he knows ned forrest like a book   has taken sundry drinks with ned   ned likes him much   is well acquainted with a certain actress  could have married her just as easy as not if he had wanted to   didn t like her  style   and so concluded not to marry her   knows dan rice well  knows all of his men and horses   is on terms of affectionate intimacy with dan s rhinoceros  and is tolerably well acquainted with the performing elephant   we encountered mr  blowhard at the circus yesterday   he was entertaining those near him with a full account of the whole institution  men  boys  horses   muils  and all   he said the rhinoceros was perfectly harmless  as his teeth had all been taken out in infancy   besides  the rhinoceros was under the influence of opium while he was in the ring  which entirely prevented his injuring anybody   no danger whatever   in due course of time the amiable beast was led into the ring   when the cord was taken from his nose  he turned suddenly and manifested a slight desire to run violently in among some boys who were seated near the musicians  the keeper  with the assistance of one of the bedouin arabs  soon induced him to change his mind  and got him in the middle of the ring   the pleasant quadruped had no sooner arrived here than he hastily started  with a melodious bellow  towards the seats on one of which sat mr  blowhard   each particular hair on mr  blowhard s head stood up  like squills upon the speckled porkupine   shakspeare or artemus ward  we forget which   and he fell  with a small shriek  down through the seats to the ground   he remained there until the agitated rhinoceros became calm  when he crawled slowly back to his seat    keep mum   he said  with a very wise shake of the head  i only wanted to have some fun with them folks above us   i swar  i ll bet the whisky they thought i was scared    great character that blowhard    1 44   market morning                    hurrah  this is market day                   up  lads  and gaily away    old comedy   on market mornings there is a roar and a crash all about the corner of kinsman and pittsburg streets   the market building  so called  we presume  because it don t in the least resemble a market building  is crowded with beef and butchers  and almost countless meat and vegetable wagons  of all sorts  are confusedly huddled together all around outside   these wagons mostly come from a few miles out of town  and are always on the spot at daybreak   a little after sunrise the crash and jam commences  and continues with little cessation until ten o clock in the forenoon   there is a babel of tongues  an excessively cosmopolitan gathering of people  a roar of wheels  and a lively smell of beef and vegetables   the soap man  the headache curative man  the razor man  and a variety of other tolerable humbugs  are in full blast   we meet married men with baskets in their hands   those who have been fortunate in their selections look happy  while some who have been unlucky wear a dejected air  for they are probably destined to get pieces of their wives  minds on their arrival home   it is true  that all married men have their own way  but the trouble is they don t all have their own way of having it   we meet a newly married man   he has recently set up housekeeping   he is out to buy steak for breakfast   there are only himself and wife and female domestic in the family   he shows us his basket  which contains steak enough for at least ten able bodied men   we tell him so  but he says we don t know anything about war  and passes on   here comes a lady of high degree  who has no end of servants to send to the market  but she likes to come herself  and it won t prevent her shining and sparkling in her elegant drawing room this afternoon   and she is accumulating muscle and freshness of face by these walks to market   and here is a charming picture   standing beside a vegetable cart is a maiden beautiful and sweeter far than any daisy in the fields  eyes of purest blue  lips of cherry red  teeth like pearls  silken  golden hair  and form of exquisite mould   we wonder if she is a fairy  but instantly conclude that she is not  for in measuring out a peck of onions she spills some of them  a small boy laughs at the mishap  and she indignantly shies the measure at his head   fairies  you know  don t throw peck measures at small boys  heads   the spell was broken   the golden chain which for a moment bound us fell to pieces   we meet an eccentric individual in corduroy pantaloons and pepper and salt coat  who wants to know if we didn t sail out of nantucket in 1852 in the whaling brig  jasper green    we are compelled to confess that the only nautical experience we ever had was to once temporarily command a canal boat on the dark rolling wabash  while the captain went ashore to cave in the head of a miscreant who had winked lasciviously at the sylph who superintended the culinary department on board that gallant craft   the eccentric individual smiles in a ghastly manner  says perhaps we won t lend him a dollar till tomorrow  to which we courteously reply that we certainly won t  and he glides away   we return to our hotel  reinvigorated with the early  healthful jaunt  and bestow an imaginary purse of gold upon our african brother  who brings us a hot and excellent breakfast    1 45   we see two witches   two female fortune tellers recently came hither  and spread  small bills  throughout the city   being slightly anxious  in common with a wide circle of relatives and friends  to know where we were going to  and what was to become of us  we visited both of these eminently respectable witches yesterday and had our fortune told  twict   physicians sometimes disagree  lawyers invariably do  editors occasionally fall out  and we are pained to say that even witches unfold different tales to one individual   in describing our interviews with these singularly gifted female women  who are actually and positively here in this city  we must speak considerably of  we   not because we flatter ourselves that we are more interesting than people in general  but because in the present case it is really necessary  in the language of hamlet s pa   list  o list

traveled extensively for the last few years  both in the united states and the west indies  and the success which has attended her in all places has won for her the reputation of being the most wonderful astrologist of the present age   the madame has a superior faculty for this business  having been born with a caul on her face  by virtue of which she can more accurately read the past

foreteller of events now living           hours of consultation  from 8 a m  to 9 o clock p m   we urbanely informed the lady with the  caul on her face  that we had called to have our fortune told

       the world renowned fortune teller and                           astrologist     madame crompton begs leave to inform the citizens of cleveland          and vicinity that she has taken rooms at

hotel  as stated in the bill above  she was driving an extensive business  and we were forced to wait half an hour or so for a chance to see her   madame crompton is of the english persuasion  and has evidently searched many long years in vain for her h   she is small in stature  but considerably inclined to corpulency  and her red round face is continually wreathed in smiles  reminding one of a new tin pan basking in the noonday sun   she took a greasy pack of common playing cards  and requested us to  cut them in three   which we did  she spread them out before her on the table  and said      sir to you which i speaks   you  av been terrible crossed in love  and your  art  as been much panged   but you ll get over it and marry a light complected gale with rayther reddish  air   before

requested us to  hang on to it    she looked into it and said    if you re not keerful when you git your money  you ll lose it  but which otherwise you will not  and fifty cents is as cheap as i kin afford to tell anybody s fortune  and no great shakes made then     1 46   from a homely man   dear plain dealer   i am a plain man  and there is a melancholy fitness in my unbosoming my sufferings to the  plain  dealer   plain as you may be in your dealings  however  i am convinced you never before had to deal with a correspondent so hopelessly plain as i  yet plain don t half express my looks   indeed i doubt very much whether any word in the english language could be found to convey an adequate idea on my absolute and utter homeliness   the dates in the old family bible show that i am in the decline of life  but i cannot recall a period in my existence when i felt really young   my very infancy  those brief months when babes prattle joyously and know nothing of care  was darkened by a shadowy presentiment of what i was to endure through life  and my youth was rendered dismal by continued repetitions of a fact painfully evident  on the face of it   that the boy was growing homelier and homelier every day  memory  that with other people recalls so much that is sweet and pleasant to think of in connection with their youth  with me brings up nothing but mortification  bitter tears  i had almost said curses  on my solitary and homely lot   i have wished  a thousand times wished  that memory had never consented to take a seat  in this distracted globe    you have heard of a man so homely that he couldn t sleep nights  his face ached so   mr  editor  i am that melancholy individual  whoever perpetrated the joke  for joke it was no doubt intended to be  knew not how much truth he was uttering  or how bitterly the idle squib would rankle in the heart of one suffering man   many and many a night have i in my childhood laid awake thinking of my homeliness  and as the moonlight has streamed in at the window and fell upon the handsome and placid features of my little brother slumbering at my side  heaven forgive me for the wicked thought  but i have felt an almost unconquerable impulse to forever disfigure and mar that sweet upturned innocent face that smiled and looked so beautiful in sleep  for it was ever reminding me of the curse i was doomed to carry about me   many and many a night have i got up in my nightdress  and lighting my little lamp  sat for hours gazing at my terrible ugliness of face reflected in the mirror  drawn to it by a cruel fascination which it was impossible for me to resist   i need not tell you that i am a single man  and yet i have had what men call affairs of the heart   i have known what it is to worship the heart s embodiment of female loveliness  and purity  and truth  but it was generally at a distance entirely safe to the object of my adoration   being of a susceptible nature  i was continually falling in love  but never  save with one single exception  did i venture to declare my flame   i saw my heart s palpitator walking in a grove  moved by my consuming love  i rushed towards her  and throwing myself at her feet began to pour forth the long pent up emotions of my heart   she gave one look and then                shrieked till all the rocks replied    at least you d thought they replied if you had seen me leave that grove with a speed greatly accelerated by a shower of rocks from the hands of an enraged brother  who was at hand   that prepossessing young lady is now slowly recovering her reason in an institution for the insane   of my further troubles i may perhaps inform you at some future time                                                          homely man    1 47   the elephant   some two years since  on the strength of what we regarded as reliable information  we announced the death of the elephant hannibal  at canton  and accompanied the announcement with a short sketch of that remarkable animal   we happened to be familiar with several interesting incidents in the private life of hannibal  and our sketch was copied by almost every paper in america and by several european journals   a few months ago a  traveled  friend showed us the sketch in a parisian journal  and possibly it is  going the rounds  of the chinese papers by this time   a few days after we had printed his obituary hannibal came to town with van amburgh s menagerie  and the same type which killed the monster restored him to life again   about once a year hannibal                     gets on a spree                     and goes bobbin around    to make a short quotation from a once popular ballad   these sprees  in fact   is what s the matter with him    the other day  in williamsburg  long island  he broke loose in the canvas  emptied most of the cages  and tore through the town like a mammoth pestilence   an extensive crowd of athletic men  by jabbing him with spears and pitchforks  and coiling big ropes around his legs  succeeded in capturing him   the animals he had set free were caught and restored to their cages without much difficulty   we doubt if we shall ever forget our first view of hannibal  which was also our first view of any elephant  of the elephant  in short  it was at the close of a sultry day in june  18     the sun had spent its fury and was going to rest among the clouds of gold and crimson   a solitary horseman might have been seen slowly ascending a long hill in a new england town   that solitary horseman was us  and we were mounted on the old white mare   two bags were strapped to the foaming steed   that was before we became wealthy  and of course we are not ashamed to say that we had been to mill  and consequently them bags contained flour and middlins   presently a large object appeared at the top of the hill   we had heard of the devil  and had been pretty often told that he would have a clear deed and title to us before long  but had never heard him painted like the object which met our gaze at the top of that hill on the close of sultry day in june   concluding  for we were a mere youth  that it was an eccentric whale  who had come ashore near north yarmouth  and was making a tour through the interior on wheels  we hastily turned our steed and made for the mill at a rapid rate  once we threw over ballast  after the manner of balloonists  and as the object gained on us we cried aloud for our parents   fortunately we reached the mill in safety  and the object passed at a furious rate  with a portion of a woodshed on its back   it was hannibal  who had run away from a neighboring town  taking a shed with him                                                drank standin   col     is a big  railroad man    he attended a railroad supper once   champagne flowed freely  and the colonel got more than his share   speeches were made after the removal of the cloth   somebody arose and eulogized the colonel in the steepest possible manner  called him great  good  patriotic  enterprising   c    c   the speaker was here interrupted by the illustrious colonel himself  who arising with considerable difficulty  and beaming benevolently around the table  gravely said   let s  hic  drink that sedimunt standin    it was done    1 48   how the napoleon of sellers was sold   we have read a great many stories of which winchell  the great wit and mimic  was the hero  showing always how neatly and entirely he sold somebody   any one who is familiar with winchell s wonderful powers of mimicry cannot doubt that these stories are all substantially true   but there is one instance which we will relate  or perish in the attempt  where the jolly winchell was himself sold  the other evening  while he was conversing with several gentlemen at one of the hotels  a dilapidated individual reeled into the room and halted in front of the stove  where he made wild and unsuccessful efforts to maintain a firm position   he evidently had spent the evening in marching torchlight processions of forty rod whisky down his throat  and at this particular time was decidedly and disreputably drunk   with a sly wink to the crowd  as much as to say   we ll have some fun with this individual   winchell assumed a solemn face  and in a ghostly voice said to one of the company    the poor fellow we were speaking of is dead     no   said the individual addressed    yes   said winchell   you know both of his eyes were gouged out  his nose was chawed off  and both of his arms were torn out at the roots   of course  he could nt recover    this was all said for the benefit of the drunken man  who was standing  or trying to stand  within a few feet of winchell  but he took no sort of notice of it  and was apparently ignorant of the celebrated delineator s presence   again winchell endeavored to attract his attention  but utterly failed as before   in a few moments the drunken man staggered out of the room    i can generally have a little fun with a drunken man   said winchell   but it is no go in this case     i suppose you know what ails the man who just went out   said the  gentlemanly host     i perceive he is alarmingly inebriated   said winchell   does anything else ail him     yes   said the host   he s deaf and dumb    this was true   there was a  larf   and winchell  with the remark that he was sorry to see a disposition in that assemblage  to deceive an orphan   called for a light and went gravely to bed    1 49   on autumn   poets are wont to apostrophize the leafy month of june  and there is no denying that if spring is  some   june is summer   but there is a gorgeous magnificence about the habiliments of nature  and a teeming fruitfulness upon her lap during the autumnal months  and we must confess we have always felt genially inclined towards this season  it is true  when we concentrate our field of vision to the minute garniture of earth  we no longer observe the beautiful petals  nor inhale the fragrance of a gay parterre of the  floral epistles  and  angel like collections  which longfellow  we believe  so graphically describes  and which shortfellows so fantastically carry about in their buttonholes  but we have all their tints reproduced upon a higher and broader canvas in the kaleidoscopic colors with which the sky and the forest daily enchant us  and the beautiful and luscious fruits which autumn spreads out before us  and            crowns the rich promise of the opening spring    in another point of view autumn is suggestive of pleasant reflections   the wearying  wasting heat of summer  and the deadly blasts with which her breath has for some years been freighted  are past  and the bracing north winds begin to bring balm and healing on their wings   the hurly burly of travel  and most sorts of publicity  except newspapers   are fast playing out  and we can once more hope to see our friends and relations in the happy sociality of home and fireside enjoyments   yielding  as we do  the full force to which autumn is seriously entitled  or rather to the serious reflections and admonitions which the decay of nature and the dying year always inspire  and admitting the poet s decade              leaves have their time to fall            and stars to set   but all            thou hast all seasons for thine own  o death    there is a brighter autumn beyond  and brighter opening years to those who choose them rather than dead leaves and bitter fruits  thus we can conclude tranquilly with bryant  as we began gaily with another              so live  that when thy summons comes to join           the innumerable caravan  which moves           to that mysterious realm  where each shall take           his chamber in the silent halls of death            thou go not  like the quarry slave at night            scourged to his dungeon  but  sustained and soothed           by an unfaltering trust  approach thy grave           like one who wraps the drapery of his couch           about him  and lies down to pleasant dreams     1 50   paying for his provender by praying   we have no intention of making fun of serious matters in telling the following story  we merely relate a fact   there is a rule at oberlin college that no student shall board at any house where prayers are not regularly made each day   a certain man fitted up a boarding house and filled it with boarders  but forgot  until the eleventh hour  the prayer proviso   not being a praying man himself  he looked around for one who was   at length he found one  a meek young man from trumbull county  who agreed to pay for his board in praying   for a while all went smoothly  but the boarding master furnished his table so poorly that the boarders began to grumble and to leave  and the other morning the praying boarder actually  struck    something like the following dialogue occurred at the table     landlord   will you pray  mr  mild   mild   no  sir  i will not   landlord   why not  mr  mild   mild   it don t pay  sir   i can t pray on such victuals as these  and unless you bind yourself in writing to set a better table than you have for the last three weeks  nary another prayer you get out of me   and that s the way the matter stood at latest advices    1 51   hunting trouble   hunting trouble is too fashionable in this world   contentment and jollity are not cultivated as they should be   there are too many prematurely wrinkled long and melancholy faces among us   there is too much swearing  sweating and slashing  fuming  foaming and fretting around and about us all                     a mad world  my masters    people rush outdoors bareheaded and barefooted  as it were  and dash blindly into all sorts of dark alleys in quest of all sorts of trouble  when   goodness knows   if they will only sit calmly and pleasantly by their firesides  trouble will knock soon enough at their doors   hunting trouble is bad business   if we ever are induced to descend from our present proud position to become a member of the legislature  or ever accumulate sufficient muscle  impudence  and taste for bad liquor to go to congress  we shall introduce  a william  for the suppression of trouble hunting   we know miss slinkins  who incessantly frets because miss slurkins is better harnessed than she is  won t like it  and we presume the simpkinses  who worry so much because the perkinses live in a freestone fronted house whilst theirs is only plain brick  won t like it also   it is doubtful  too  whether our long haired friends the reformers  who think the machinery of the world is all out of joint  while we think it only needs a little greasing to run in first rate style   will approve the measure   it is probable  indeed  that very many societies  of a reformatory  and inflammatory  character  would frown upon the measure   but the measure would be a good one nevertheless   never hunt trouble   however dead a shot one may be  the gun he carries on such expeditions is sure to kick or go off half cocked  trouble will come soon enough  and when he does come  receive him as pleasantly as possible  like the tax collector  he is a disagreeable chap to have in one s house  but the more amiably you greet him the sooner he will go away    1 52   dark doings   four promising young men of this city attended a ball in the rural districts not long since   at a late hour they retired  leaving word with the clerk of the hotel to call them early in the morning  as they wanted to take the first train home   the clerk was an old friend of the  fellers   and he thought he would have a slight joke at their expense   so he burnt some cork  and  with a sponge  blacked the faces of his city friends after they had got soundly asleep   in the morning he called them about ten minutes before the train came along   feller no  1 awoke and laughed boisterously at the sight which met his gaze   but he saw through it  the clerk had played his good joke on his three comrades  and of course he would keep mum   but it was a devilish good joke   feller no  2 awoke  saw the three black men in the room  comprehended the joke  and laughed vociferously   but he would keep mum   fellers no  3 and 4 awoke  and experienced the same pleasant feeling  and there was the beautiful spectacle of four nice young men laughing heartily one at another  each one supposing the  urban clerk  had spared him in his cork daubing operations   they had only time to dress before the train arrived   they all got aboard  each thinking what a glorious joke it was to have his three companions go back to town with black faces   the idea was so rich that they all commenced laughing violently as soon as they got aboard the cars   the other passengers took to laughing also  and fun raged fast and furious  until the benevolent baggage man  seeing how matters stood  brought a small pocket glass and handed it around to the young men   they suddenly stopped laughing  rushed wildly for the baggage car  washed their faces  and amused and instructed each other during the remainder of the trip with some eloquent flashes of silence    1 53   reporters   the following paragraph is going the rounds    how many a great man is now basking in the sunshine of fame generously bestowed upon him by the prolific genius of some reporter   how many stupid orations have been made brilliant  how many wandering  pointless  objectless  speeches put in form and rendered at least readable  by the unknown reporter   how many a disheartened speaker  who was conscious the night before of a failure  before a thin  cold  spiritless audience  awakes delighted to learn that he has addressed an overwhelming assemblage of his enthusiastic  appreciating fellow citizens  to find his speech sparkling with  cheers   breaking out into  immense applause   and concluding amidst  the wildest excitement     there is considerable truth in the above  we are sorry to state  reporters are too apt to smooth over and give a fair face to the stupidity and bombast of political and other public humbugs   for this they are not only seldom thanked  but frequently are kicked  of course this sort of thing is wrong   a reporter should be independent enough to meet the approaches of gentlemen of the nincompoop persuasion with a flat rebuff   he should never gloss over a political humbug  whether he belongs to  our side  or not  he is not thanked for doing it  and  furthermore  he loses the respect and confidence of his readers   there are many amiable gentlemen ornamenting the various walks of life  who are under the impression that for a dozen bad cigars or a few drinks of worse whisky they can purchase the  opinion  of almost any reporter   it has been our pleasure on several occasions to disabuse those gentlemen of this impression   should another occasion of this kind ever offer  we feel that we should be  adequate  to treat it in a similar manner   a reporter  we modestly submit  is as good as anybody  and ought to feel that he is  everywhere and at all times   for one  let us quietly and without any show of vanity remark  that we are not only just as good as anybody else  but a great deal better than many we know of   we love god and hate indians   pay our debts  support the constitution of the united states  go in for progress  sunshine  calico  and other luxuries  are perfectly satisfied and happy  and wouldn t swop  sits  with the president  louis napoleon  the emperor of china  sultan of turkey  brigham young  or nicholas longworth   success to us    1 54   he had the little voucher in his pocket   l   lived in this city several years ago   he dealt in horses  carriages   c   hearing of a good chance to sell buggies up west  he embarked with a lot for that  great  country   at toledo he took a michigan southern train   somebody had by way of a joke  warned him against the conductor of that particular train  telling him that said conductor had an eccentric way of taking up tickets at the beginning of the journey  and of denying that he had done so and demanding fare at the end thereof   this the confiding l   swallowed   he determined not to be swindled in this way  and so when the conductor came around and asked him for his ticket he declined giving up   the conductor insisted   l   still refused    i ve got the little voucher in my pocket   he said  with a knowing look  slily slapping the pocket which contained the ticket   the conductor glanced at l   s stalwart frame   he had heard l   spoken of as a fighting man   he preferred not to grapple with him  the train was a light one  and it so happened that l   was the only man in this  the hind car   so the conductor had the train stopped  and quietly unhitched this car    good day  mr  l   he yelled   just keep that little voucher in your pocket  and be d  d to you    l   jumped up and saw the other cars moving rapidly away   he was left solitary and alone  in a dismal piece of woods known as the black swamp   he remained there in the car until night  when the down train came along and took him to toledo   he had to pay fare  his up through ticket not being good on that train   his buggies had gone unattended to chicago   he was very angry   he finally got through  but he will never hear the last of that  little voucher     1 55   the gentlemanly conductor   few have any idea of the trials and tribulations of the railway conductor   the gentlemanly conductor   as one horse newspapers delight in styling him   unless you are gifted with the patience of the lamented job  who  tradition informs us  had  biles  all over his body  and didn t swear once  never go for a conductor  me boy   the other evening we enlivened a railroad car with our brilliant presence  starting time was not quite up  and the passengers were amusing themselves by laughing  swearing  singing  and talking  according to their particular fancy   the conductor came in  and the following were a few of the questions put to him   one old fellow  who was wrapped up in a horse blanket  and who apparently had about two pounds of pigtail in his mouth  wanted to know   what pint of compass the keers was travelin in    an old lady  surrounded by band boxes and enveloped in flannels  wanted to know what time the eight o clock train left rock island for  dubu kue    a carroty haired young man wanted to know if  free omyibuses  ran from the cars to the taverns in toledo   a tall  razor faced individual  evidently from the interior of connecticut  desired to know if  conductin  paid as well eout west as it did deoun in his country  and a portly  close shaven man with round keen eyes  and in whose face you could read the interest table  asked the price of corner lots in omaha   these and many other equally absurd questions the conductor answered calmly and in a resigned manner   and we shuddered as we thought how he would have to answer a similar string of questions in each of the three cars ahead    1 56   morality and genius   we see it gravely stated in a popular metropolitan journal that  true genius goes hand in hand  necessarily  with morality    the statement is not a startlingly novel one   it has been made  probably  about sixty thousand times before   but it is untrue and foolish   we wish genius and morality were affectionate companions  but it is a fact that they are often bitter enemies   they don t necessarily coalesce any more than oil and water do   innumerable instances may be readily produced in support of this proposition  nobody doubts that sheridan had genius  yet he was a sad dog   mr  byron  the author of childe harold  and other poems   was a man of genius  we think  yet mr  byron was a fearfully fast man   edgar a  poe wrote magnificent poetry and majestic prose  but he was  in private life  hardly the man for small and select tea parties  we fancy sir richard steele was a man of genius  but he got disreputably drunk  and didn t pay his debts   swift had genius  an immense lot of it  yet swift was a cold blooded  pitiless  bad man  the catalogue might be spun out to any length  but it were useless to do it   we don t mean to intimate that men of genius must necessarily be sots and spendthrifts  we merely speak of the fact that very many of them have been both  and in some instances much worse than both   still we can t well see  though some think they can  how the pleasure and instruction people derive from reading the productions of these great lights is diminished because their morals were  lavishly loose    they might have written better had their private lives been purer  but of this nobody can determine for the pretty good reason that nobody knows   so with actors   we have seen people stay away from the theater because mrs  grundy said the star of the evening invariably retired to his couch in a state of extreme inebriety   if the star is afflicted with a weakness of this kind  we may regret it   we may pity or censure the star   but we must still acknowledge the star s genius  and applaud it   hence we conclude that the chronic weakness of actors no more affects the question of the propriety of patronizing theatrical representations  than the profligacy of journeymen shoemakers affects the question of the propriety of wearing boots   all of which is respectfully submitted    1 57   rough beginning of the honeymoon   on last friday morning an athletic young farmer in the town of waynesburg took a fair girl   all bathed in blushes   from her parents  and started for the first town across the pennsylvania line to be married  where the ceremony could be performed without a license   the happy pair were accompanied by a sister of the girl  a tall  gaunt  and sharp featured female of some thirty seven summers  the pair crossed the line  were married  and returned to wellsville to pass the night   people at the hotel where the wedding party stopped observed that they conducted themselves in a rather singular manner   the husband would take his sister in law  the tall female aforesaid  into one corner of the parlor and talk earnestly to her gesticulating wildly the while   then the tall female would  put her foot down  and talk to him in an angry and excited manner   then the husband would take his fair young bride into a corner  but he could no sooner commence talking to her than the gaunt sister would rush in between them and angrily join in the conversation   the people at the hotel ascertained what all this meant about 9 o clock that evening   there was an uproar in the room which had been assigned to the newly married couple   female shrieks and masculine  swears  startled the people at the hotel  and they rushed to the spot   the gaunt female was pressing and kicking against the door of the room  and the newly married man  mostly undressed  was barring her out with all his might   occasionally she would kick the door far enough open to disclose the stalwart husband  in his gentleman greek slave apparel   it appeared that the tall female insisted upon occupying the same room with the newly wedded pair  that her sister was favorably disposed to the arrangement  and that the husband had agreed to it before the wedding took place  and was now indignantly repudiating the contract    won t you go away now  susan  peaceful   said the newly married man  softening his voice    no   said she   i won t  so there     don t you budge an inch   cried the married sister within the room    now  now  maria   said the young man to his wife  in a piteous tone   don t go for to cuttin  up in this way  now don t     i ll cut up s much i wanter   she sharply replied    well   roared the desperate man  throwing the door wide open and stalking out among the crowd   well  jest you two wimin put on your duds and go right straight home and bring back the old man and woman  and your grandfather  who is nigh on to a hundred  bring  em all here  and i ll marry the whole d  d caboodle of  em and we ll all sleep together    the difficulty was finally adjusted by the tall female taking a room alone  wellsville is enjoying itself over the  sensation     1 58   a colored man of the name of jeffries   one beautiful day last august  mr  elmer of east cleveland  sent his hired colored man  of the name of jeffries  to town with a two horse wagon to get a load of lime   mr  elmer gave jeffries 5 dollars with which to pay for the lime   the horses were excellent ones  by the way  nicely matched  and more than commonly fast   the colored man of the name of jeffries came to town and drove to the johnson street station where he encountered a frail young woman of the name of jenkins  who had just been released from jail  where she had been confined for naughtical conduct  drugging and robbing a sailor    will you fly with me  adorable jenkins   he unto her did say   or words to that effect   and unto him in reply she did up and say   my african brother  i will   spirit   she continued  alluding to a stone jug under the seat in the wagon   i follow    then into the two horse wagon this fair maiden got and knavely telling the  perlice   to embark by the first packet for an unromantic land where the climate is intensely tropical  and where even laplanders  who like fire  get more of a good thing than they want  doing and saying thus the woman of the name of jenkins mounted the seat with the colored man of the sweet name of jeffries  and so these two sweet  gushing children of nature rode gaily away   away towards the setting sun   away towards indiana  bright land of cheap whisky and corn doin s    1 59   names   any name which is suggestive of a joke  however poor the joke may be  is often a nuisance   we were once  confined  in a printing  office with a man named snow   everybody who came in was bound to have a joke about snow   if it was summer the mad wags would say we ought to be cold  for we had snow there all the time  which was a fact  though we sometimes wished snow was where he would speedily melt   not that we didn t like snow   far from it   his name was what disgusted us   it was also once our misfortune to daily mingle with a man named berry  we can t tell how many million times we heard him called elderberry  raspberry  blueberry  huckleberry  gooseberry   c   the thing nearly made him deranged   he joined the filibusters and has made energetic efforts to get shot but had not succeeded at last accounts  although we hear he has been  slewd  numerously   there is a good deal in a name  our usually correct friend w  shakespeare to the contrary notwithstanding   our own name is  unfortunately  one on which jokes  such as they are  can be made  we cannot present a tabular statement of the times we have done things brown  in the opinion of partial friends  or have been asked if we were related to the eccentric old slave and horse  liberator   whose recent virginia reel has attracted so much of the public attention   could we do so the array of figures would be appalling   and sometimes we think we will accept the first good offer of marriage that is made to us  for the purpose of changing our unhappy name  setting other interesting considerations entirely aside    1 60   he found he would   several years ago bill mccracken lived in peru  indiana    we were in peru several years ago  and it was a nice place we don t think   mr  mccracken was a screamer  and had whipped all the recognized fighting men on the wabash   one day somebody told him that jack long  blacksmith of logansport  said he would give him  mccracken  a protracted fit of sickness if he would just come down there and smell of his bones   the mccracken at once laid in a stock of provisions  consisting of whisky in glass and chickens in the shell  and started for logansport   in a few days  he was brought home in a bunged up condition  on a cot bed   one eye was gouged out  a portion of his nose was chawed off  his left arm was in a sling  his head was done up in an old rag  and he was pretty badly off himself  he was set down in the village bar room  and turning to the crowd he  in a feeble voice  said  hot tears bedewing his face the while   boys  you know jack long said if i d come down to loginsput he d whale h  ll out of me  and boys  you know i didn t believe it  but i ve been down thar and i found he would    he recovered after a lapse of years and led a better life   as he said himself  he returned from logansport a changed man    1 61    burial in richmond and resurrection in boston    a drama with this title  written by a colored citizen  an artist by profession   the characters being performed by colored citizens  was played at the melodeon last evening   there were several white persons present  though most of the audience were colored   the great variety of colors made a gay  and indeed we may say gorgeous spectacle   a hasty sketch of this great moral production may not be uninteresting   act 1st  scene 1st  discloses a log cabin  with fifteen minutes  intermission between each log    william  a spirited slave   and  john  the obedient slave   are in the cabin  william  the spirited slave  says he will be free   why   says william   am i here thus   was this frame made to be in bondage  shall these voices be hushed   never  never  never     oh  don t say it thus   says john  the obedient slave   for thus it should not be  an  i tole ye what it was  now  jes take keer of them pistiles or they ll work yer ruins   mind what i say  wilyim   as for me i shall stay here with my dear julia     immense applause     and so it has come to this  ha   said william  the spirited slave  standing himself up and brandishing his arms in a terrific manner    and so it has come to this  ha   and this is a free land  so it has come to this  to this  to this    william appeared to be somewhat confused at this point  but a wealthy newsboy in the audience helped him out by crying   or any other man    john and william then embraced  bitter tears moistening their manly breasts    farwel  wilyim   said john  the obedient slave   and bless you  bless you  me child    the spirited slave walks off and the obedient slave falls into a swoon  tableau   the goddess of liberty appears in a mackinaw blanket and pours incense on the obedient slave   a member of the orchestra gets up and softly warbles on a bass drum   angels are heard singing in the distance   curtain falls  the audience being soaking wet with tears   act 2  scene first  discloses the house of mr  lyons  a slaveholder in virginia   mr  lyons  as we learn by the play  is  a member of the whig congress    he learns that william  his spirited slave  has escaped   this makes him very angry  and he says he will break every bone in william s body   he goes out and searches for william  but cannot find him  and comes back   he takes a heavy drink  is stricken with remorse  and declares his intention to become a nun  john  the obedient slave  comes in and asks permission to marry julia   mr  lyons says  certainly  by all means  and preparations are made for the wedding   the wedding takes place   the scene that follows is rather incomprehensible   a young mariner has a clandestine interview with the obedient slave  and receives 10 dollars to make a large box   an elderly mariner  not that mariner  but another mariner  rushes madly in and fires a horse pistol into the air   he wheels and is about going off  when a black octoroon rushes madly in and fires another horse pistol at the retreating mariner  who falls   he says he is going to make a die of it   says he should have acted differently if he had only done otherwise  which was right  or else it wouldn t be so   he forgets his part and don t say anything more  but he wraps himself up in the american flag and expires like a son of a gentleman   more warblings on the bass drum   the rest of the orchestra endeavor to accompany the drum  but are so deeply affected that they can t   there is a death like stillness in the house   all was so still that had a cannon been fired off it could have been distinctly seen   the next scene discloses a large square box   several colored persons are seen standing round the square box   the mariner who was killed in the last scene commences knocking off the cover of the box   he pulls the cover off  and up jumps the obedient slave and his wife   the obedient slave and his dear julia fall out of the box   great applause   they rush to the footlights and kneel   quick music by the orchestra  in which the bass drum don t warble so much as she did    i m free   i m free   i m free    shrieks the obedient slave   o i m free    the stage is suddenly lighted up in a gorgeous manner   the obedient slave and his dear julia continue kneeling  the dead mariner blesses them   the goddess of liberty appears again  this time in a beaver overcoat  and pours some more incense on the obedient slave   an allegorical picture of virtue appears in a red vest and military boots  on the left proscenium  john brown the barber appears as lady macbeth  and says there is a blue tinge into his nails  and consequently he is an octoroon   another actor wants to define his position on the euclid street improvement  but is hissed down   curtain descends amidst the admiring shouts of the audience  red fire  music  and the violent assertion of the obedient slave that he is free   the play will not be repeated this evening  as was announced   the notice will be given of its next performance   it is the greatest effort of the kind that we ever witnessed    1 62   a mayoralty election   messrs

of superior street at 6 o clock yesterday morning for a fishing excursion down the lake  there were about twenty persons in the party  and we think we never saw a more lovely lot of men   the noble craft swept majestically out of the cuyahoga into the lake  and as she sped past a retired coal dealer s office the usher borrowed our pocket handkerchief  which in the excess of his emotion he forgot to return to us  to wipe away four large tears which trickled from his light bay eyes  on dashed the leviathan at the rate of about forty five knots an hour   the fishing ground reached  the clarion voice of sholl was heard to ejaculate   reef home the jib boom  shorten the main brace  splice the forecastle  and throw the hurricane deck overboard  lively  my lads     aye  aye  sir   said marsh the chaplain of the expedition  in tones of thunder  and the gallant party sprang to execute the captain s orders  the agile form of first officer hilliard being especially conspicuous in reefing the jib boom  lines were cast and the sport commenced   it seemed as if all the fish in the lake knew of our coming  and had collected in that particular spot for the express purpose of being caught   what teeth they had  sufficiently good  certainly  to bite a cartridge or anything else   the usher caught the first fish  a small but beautiful bass  whose weight was about three inches and a half   the usher was elated at this streak of luck  but his hand did not tremble and he continued to hand in fish until at noon he had caught thirteen firkins full and he announced that he should fish no more  cruelty was no part of his nature and he did not think it right to slaughter fish in this way   cross  barney  and the rest  were immensely successful  and hauled in tremendous quantities of bass  perch  mackinaw trout  and connecticut shad   bone didn t catch a fish  and we shall never forget the sorrowful manner in which the poor fellow gazed upon our huge pile of beautiful bass which occupied all of the quarter deck and a large portion of the forcastle   having fished enough the party went ashore  where they found ab  mcilrath  who was fanning himself with a barn door   the grand commandant  who in a sonorous voice requested the parties  as they alighted from the small boats  to  keep their heads out of water    the general  who was discussing with the doctor the propriety of annexing east cleveland to the united states   and several distinguished gentlemen from town  who had come down with life preservers and ginger pop   after disposing of a sumptuous lunch  the party amused and instructed each other by conversation  and about 3 o clock the shrill whistle of the leviathan was sounded by mike the urbane and accomplished engineer  and the party were soon homeward

shahrazad  fn 1    it hath reached me  o auspicious king of intelligence penetrating  that there was  amongst the kings of bassorah fn 2   a king who loved the poor and needy and cherished his lieges  and gave of his wealth to all who believed in mohammed  whom allah bless and assain    and he was even as one of the poets described him    a king who when hosts of the foe invade    receives them with      lance lunge and sabre sway  writes his name on bosoms in thin red lines    and scatters the      horsemen in wild dismay   fn 3   his name was king mohammed bin sulayman al zayni  and he had two wazirs  one called al mu in  son of sawi and the other al fazl son of khakan  now al fazl was the most generous of the people of his age  upright of life  so that all hearts united in loving him and the wise flocked to him for counsel  whilst the subjects used to pray for his long life  because he was a compendium of the best qualities  encouraging the good and lief  and preventing evil and mischief   but the wazir mu in bin sawi on the contrary hated folk  fn 4  and loved not the good and was a mere compound of ill  even as was said of him    hold to nobles  sons of nobles   tis ever nature s test    that      nobles born of nobles shall excel in noble deed  and shun the mean of soul  meanly bred  for  tis the law     mean      deeds come of men who are mean of blood and breed    and as much as the people loved and fondly loved al fazl bin khakan  so they hated and thoroughly hated the mean and miserly mu in bin sawi  it befel one day by the decree of the decreer  that king mohammed bin sulayman al zayni  being seated on his throne with his officers of state about him  summoned his wazir al fazl and said to him   i wish to have a slave girl of passing beauty  perfect in loveliness  exquisite in symmetry and endowed with all praiseworthy gifts    said the courtiers   such a girl is not to be bought for less than ten thousand gold pieces   whereupon the sultan called out to his treasurer and said   carry ten thousand dinars to the house of al fazl bin khakan   the treasurer did the king s bidding  and the minister went away  after receiving the royal charge to repair to the slave bazar every day  and entrust to brokers the matter aforesaid   moreover the king issued orders that girls worth above a thousand gold pieces should not be bought or sold without being first displayed to the wazir   accordingly no broker purchased a slave girl ere she had been paraded before the minister  but none pleased him  till one day a dealer came to the house and found him taking horse and intending for the palace   so he caught hold of his stirrup saying    o thou  who givest to royal state sweet savour    thou rt a      wazir shalt never fail of favour  dead bounty thou hast raised to life for men     ne er fail of      allah s grace such high endeavour    then quoth he   o my lord  that surpassing object for whom the gracious mandate was issued is at last found   fn 5   and quoth the wazir   here with her to me    so he went away and returned after a little  bringing a damsel in richest raiment robed  a maid spear straight of stature and five feet tall  budding of bosom with eyes large and black as by kohl traced  and dewy lips sweeter than syrup or the sherbet one sips  a virginette smooth cheeked and shapely faced  whose slender waist with massive hips was engraced  a form more pleasing than branchlet waving upon the top most trees  and a voice softer and gentler than the morning breeze  even as saith one of those who have described her    strange is the charm which dights her brows like luna s disk      that shine    o sweeter taste than sweetest robb fn 6  or      raisins of the vine  a throne th empyrean keeps for her in high and glorious state         for wit and wisdom  wandlike form and graceful bending line  she in the heaven of her face fn 7  the seven fold stars      displays    that guard her cheeks as satellites against      the spy s design  if man should cast a furtive glance or steal far look at her         his heart is burnt by devil bolts shot by those piercing      eyne    when the wazir saw her she made him marvel with excess of admiration  so he turned  perfectly pleased  to the broker and asked   what is the price of this girl    whereto he answered   her market value stands at ten thousand dinars  but her owner swears that this sum will not cover the cost of the chickens she hath eaten  the wine she hath drunken and the dresses of honour bestowed upon her instructor  for she hath learned calligraphy and syntax and etymology  the commentaries of the koran  the principles of law and religion  the canons of medicine  and the calendar and the art of playing on musical instruments   fn 8  said the wazir   bring me her master    so the broker brought him at once and  behold  he was a persian of whom there was left only what the days had left  for he was as a vulture bald and scald and a wall trembling to its fall   time had buffetted him with sore smart  yet was he not willing this world to depart  even as said the poet    time hath shattered all my frame     oh  how time hath      shattered me  time with lordly might can tame      manly strength and vigour      free  time was in my youth  that none      sped their way more fleet          and fast  time is and my strength is gone      youth is sped  and speed      is past  fn 9    the wazir asked him   art thou content to sell this slave girl to the sultan for ten thousand dinars    and the persian answered   by allah  if i offer her to the king for naught  it were but my devoir   fn 10  so the minister bade bring the monies and saw them weighed out to the persian  who stood up before him and said   by the leave of our lord the wazir  i have somewhat to say   and the wazir replied   out with all thou hast     it is my opinion   continued the slave dealer   that thou shouldst not carry the maid to the king this day  for she is newly off a journey  the change of air fn 11  hath affected her and the toils of trouble have fretted her   but keep her quiet in thy palace some ten days  that she may recover her looks and become again as she was   then send her to the hammam and clothe her in the richest of clothes and go up with her to the sultan  this will be more to thy profit    the wazir pondered the persian s words and approved of their wisdom  so he carried her to his palace  where he appointed her private rooms  and allowed her every day whatever she wanted of meat and drink and so forth   and on this wise she abode a while   now the wazir al fazl had a son like the full moon when sheeniest dight  with face radiant in light  cheeks ruddy bright  and a mole like a dot of ambergris on a downy site  as said of him the poet and said full right    a moon which blights you fn 12  if you dare behold    a branch      which folds you in its waving fold  locks of the zanj fn 13  and golden glint of hair    sweet gait      and form a spear to have and hold  ah  hard of heart with softest slenderest waist    that evil to      this weal why not remould  fn 14  were thy form s softness placed in thy heart    ne er would thy      lover find thee harsh and cold  oh thou accuser  be my love s excuser    nor chide if love pangs      deal me woes untold  i bear no blame   tis all my hear and eyne    so leave thy      blaming  let me yearn and pine    now the handsome youth knew not the affair of the damsel  and his father had enjoined her closely  saying   know  o my daughter  that i have bought thee as a bedfellow for our king  mohammed bin sulayman al zayni  and i have a son who is a satan for girls and leaves no maid in the neighbourhood without taking her maidenhead  so be on thy guard against him and beware of letting him see thy face or hear they voice    hearkening and obedience   said the girl  and he left her and fared forth   some days after this it happened by decree of destiny  that the damsel repaired to the baths in the house  where some of the slave women bathed her  after which she arrayed herself in sumptuous raiment  and her beauty and loveliness were thereby redoubled   then she went in to the wazir s wife and kissed her hand  and the dame said to her   naiman   may it benefit thee  fn 15  o anis al  jalis  fn 16   are not our baths handsome     o my mistress   she replied   i lacked naught there save thy gracious presence    thereupon the lady said to her slave women   come with us to the hammam  for it is some days since we went there   they answered   to hear is to obey   and rose and all accompanied her  now she had set two little slave girls to keep the door of the private chamber wherein was anis al jalis and had said to them   suffer none go in to the damsel    presently  as the beautiful maiden sat resting in her rooms  suddenly came in the wazir s son whose name was nur al din ali  fn 17  and asked after his mother and her women  to which the two little slave girls replied   they are in the hammam    but the damsel  anis al jalis  had heard from within nur al din ali s voice and had said to herself   o would heaven i saw what like is this youth against whom the wazir warned me  saying that he hath not left a virgin in the neighbourhood without taking her virginity  by allah  i do long to have sight of him    so she sprang to her feet with the freshness of the bath on her and  stepping to the door  looked at nur al din ali and saw a youth like the moon in its full and the sight bequeathed her a thousand sighs  the young man also glanced at her and the look make him heir to a thousand thoughts of care  and each fell into love s ready snare   then he stepped up to the two little slave girls and cried aloud at them  whereupon both fled before him and stood afar off to see what he would do   and behold  he walked to the door of the damsel s chamber and  opening it  went in and asked her  art thou she my father bought for me   and she answered  yes   thereupon the youth  who was warm with wine  came up to her and embraced her  then he took her legs and passed them round his waist and she wound her arms about his neck  and met him with kisses and murmurs of pleasure and amorous toyings   next he sucked her tongue and she sucked his  and lastly  he loosed the strings of her petticoat trousers and abated her maidenhead   when the two little slave girls saw their young master get in unto the damsel  anis al jalis  they cried out and shrieked  so as soon as the youth had had his wicked will of her  he rose and fled forth fearing the consequences of his ill doing   when the wazir s wife heard the slave girls  cries  she sprang up and came out of the baths with the perspiration pouring from her face  saying   what is this unseemly clamour in the house fn 18     then she came up to the two little slave  girls and asked them saying   fie upon you  what is the matter    and both answered   verily our lord nur al din came in and beat us  so we fled  then he went up to anis al jalis and threw his arms round her and we know not what he did after that  but when we cried out to thee he ran away    upon this the lady went to anis al jalis and said to her   what tidings     o my lady   she answered   as i was sitting here lo  a handsome young man came in and said to me   art thou she my father bought for me   and i answered yes  for  by allah  o mistress mine  i believed that his words were true  and he instantly came in and embraced me     did he nought else with thee but this   quoth the lady  and quoth she   indeed he did   but he did it only three times    he did not leave thee without dishonouring thee   cried the wazir s wife and fell to weeping and buffetting her face  she and the girl and all the handmaidens  fearing lest nur al din s father should kill him  fn 19   whilst they were thus  in came the wazir and asked what was the matter  and his wife said to him   swear that whatso i tell thee thou wilt attend to it     i will   answered he   so she related to him what his son had done  whereat he was much concerned and rent his raiment and smote his face till his nose bled  and plucked out his beard by the handful   do not kill thyself   said his wife   i will give thee ten thousand dinars  her price  of my own money    but he raised his head and cried   out upon thee   i have no need of her purchase money  my fear is lest life as well as money go     o my lord  and how is that     wottest thou not that yonder standeth our enemy al mu in bin sawi who  as soon as he shall hear of this matter  will go up to the sultan   and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say                 when it was the thirty fifth night   she continued  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that the wazir said to his wife   wottest thou not that yonder standeth our enemy al mu in bin sawi who  as soon as he hears of this matter will go up to the sultan and say to him   thy wazir who  thou wilt have it loveth thee  took from thee ten thousand ducats and bought therewith a slave girl whose like none ever beheld  but when he saw her  she pleased him and he said to his son   take her  thou art worthier of her than the sultan    so he took her and did away with her virginity and she is now in his house    the king will say   thou liest   to which he will reply   with thy leave i will fall upon him unawares and bring her to thee    the king will give him warranty for this and he will come down upon the house and will take the girl and present her to the sultan  who will question her and she will not be able to deny the past   then mine enemy will say   o my lord  thou wottest that i give thee the best of counsel  but i have not found favour in thine eyes    thereupon the sultan will make an example of me  and i shall be a gazing stock to all the people and my life will be lost    quoth his wife   let none know of this thing which hath happened privily  and commit thy case to allah and trust in him to save thee from such strait  for he who knoweth the future shall provide for the future    with this she brought the wazir a cup of wine and his heart was quieted  and he ceased to feel wrath and fear   thus far concerning him  but as regards his son nur al din ali  fearing the consequence of his misdeed he abode his day long in the flower garden and came back only at night to his mother s apartment where he slept  and  rising before dawn  returned to the gardens   he ceased not to do thus for two whole months without showing his face to his parent  till at last his mother said to his father   o my lord  shall we lose our boy as well as the girl   if matters continue long in this way he will flee from us     and what to do   asked he  and she answered   do thou watch this night  and  when he cometh  seize on him and frighten him  i will rescue him from thee and do thou make peace with him and give him the damsel to wife  for she loveth him as he loveth her   and i will pay thee her price   so the minister say up that night and  when his son came  he seized him and throwing him down knelt on his breast and showed as thou he would cut his throat  but his mother ran to the youth s succour and asked her husband   what wouldest thou do with him    he answered her   i will split his weasand    said the son to the father   is my death  then  so light a matter to thee    and his father s eyes welled with tears  for natural affection moved him  and he rejoined   o my son  how light was to thee the loss of my good and my life    quoth nur al din   hear  o my father  what the poet hath said    forgive me  thee ward sinned i  but the wise   ne er to the      sinner shall deny his grace  thy foe may pardon sue when lieth he   in lowest  and thou      holdest highest place     thereupon the wazir rose from off his son s breast saying   i forgive thee    for his heart yearned to him  and the youth kissed the hand of his sire who said   o my son  were i sure that thou wouldest deal justly by anis al jalis  i would give her to thee     o my father  what justice am i to do to her     i enjoin thee  o my son  not to take another wife or concubine to share with her  nor sell her     o my father  i swear to thee that verily i will not do her injustice in either way    having sworn to that effect nur al din went in to the damsel and abode with her a whole year  whilst allah almighty caused the king to forget the matter of the maiden  and al mu in  though the affair came to his ears  dared not divulge it by reason of the high favour in which his rival stood with the sultan   at the end of the year al fazl went one day to the public baths  and  as he came out whilst he was still sweating  the air struck him fn 20  and he caught a cold which turned to a fever  then he took to his bed   his malady gained ground and restlessness was longsome upon him and weakness bound him like a chain  so he called out   hither with my son   and when nur al din ali came he said to him   o my son  know that man s lot and means are distributed and decreed  and the end of days by all must be dree d  and that every soul drain the cup of death is nature s need    the he repeated these lines    i die my death  but he alone is great who dieth not    and well      i wot  soon shall i die  for death was made my lot  a king there s not that dies and holds his kingdom in his hand         for sovranty the kingdom is of him who dieth not    then he continued   o my son  i have no charge to leave thee save that thou fear allah and look to the issues of thine acts and bear in mind my injunctions anent anis al jalis     o my father   said nur al din   who is like unto thee   indeed thou art famed for well doing and preachers offer prayers for thee in their pulpits    quoth al fazl   o my son  i hope that allah almighty may grant me acceptance    then he pronounced the two testimonies  fn 21  or professions of the faith  and was recorded among the blessed   the palace was filled with crying and lamentation and the news of his death reached the king  and the city people wept  even those at their prayers and women at household cares and the school children shed tears for bin  khakan   then his son nur al din ali arose and made ready his funeral  and the emirs and wazirs and high officers of state and city notables were present  amongst them the wazir al mu in bin sawi   and as the bier went forth from the house some one in the crowd of mourners began to chant these lines    on the fifth day i quitted al my friends for evermore    and      they laid me out and washed me on a slab without my      door  fn 22  they stripped me of the clothes i was ever wont to wear    and      they clothed me in the clothes which till then i never wore  on four men s necks they bore me and carried me from home   to      chapel  and some prayed for him on neck they bore  they prayed for me a prayer that no prostration knows  fn 23         they prayed for me who praised me and were my friends of      yore  and they laid me in a house with a ceiling vaulted o er    and      time shall be no more ere it ope to me its door    when they had shovelled in the dust over him and the crowd had dispersed  nur al din returned home and he lamented with sobs and tears  and the tongue of the case repeated these couplets    on the fifth day at even tide they went away from me          farewelled them as faring they made farewell my lot  but my spirit as they went  with them went and so i cried     ah      return ye   but replied she   alas  return is not to a framework lere and lorn that lacketh blood and life    a      frame whereof remaineth naught but bones that rattle and      rot  mine eyes are blind and cannot see quencht by the flowing tear         mine ears are dull and lost to sense  they have no power to      hear     he abode a long time sorrowing for his father till  one day  as he was sitting at home  there came a knocking at the door  so he rose in haste and opening let in a man  one of his father s intimates and who had been the wazir s boon companion   the visitor kissed nur al din s hand and said to him   o my lord  he who hath left the like of thee is not dead  and this way went also the chief of the ancients and the moderns   fn 24  o my lord ali  be comforted and leave sorrowing    thereupon nur al din rose and going to the guest saloon transported thither all he needed  then he assembled his companions and took his handmaid again  and  collecting round him ten of the sons of the merchants  began to eat meat and drink wine  giving entertainment after entertainment and lavishing his presents and his favours   one day his steward came to him and said   o my lord nur al din  hast thou not heard the saying  whoso spendeth and reckoneth not  to poverty wendeth and recketh not    and he repeated what the poet wrote    i look to my money and keep it with care    for right well i wot       tis my buckler and brand  did i lavish my dirhams on hostilest foes  fn 25    i should      truck my good luck by mine ill luck trepanned  so i ll eat it and drink it and joy in my wealth    and no      spending my pennies on others i ll stand  i will keep my purse close  gainst whoever he be    and a niggard      in grain a true friend ne er i fand  far better deny him than come to say   lend    and five fold the      loan shall return to thy hand  and he turns face aside and he sidles away    while i stand like      a dog disappointed  unmanned  oh  the sorry lot his who hath yellow boys none    though his      genius and virtues shine bright as the sun   o my master   continued the steward   this lavish outlay and these magnificent gifts waste away wealth    when nur al din ali heard these words he looked at his servant and cried   of all thou hast spoken i will not heed one single word  for i have heard the saying of the poet who saith    an my palm be full of wealth and my wealth i ne er bestow    a      palsy take my hand and my foot ne er rise again  show my niggard who by niggardise e er rose to high degree    or      the generous gifts generally hath slain     and he pursued   know  o steward  it is my desire that so long as thou hast money enough for my breakfast  thou trouble me not with taking thought about my supper    thereupon the steward asked   must it be so    and he answered   it must    so the honest man went his way and nur al din ali devoted himself to extravagance  and  if any of his cup companions chanced to say   this is a pretty thing   he would reply    tis a gift to thee    or if another said   o my lord  such a house is handsome   he would answer   take it  it is thine    after this reckless fashion he continued to live for a whole year  giving his friends a banquet in the morning and a banquet in the evening and a banquet at midnight  till one day  as the company was sitting together  the damsel anis al jalis repeated these lines    thou deemedst well of time when days went well    and feardest      not what ills might deal thee fate  thy nights so fair and restful cozened thee     for peaceful      nights bring woes of heavy weight    when she had ended her verse behold  somebody knocked at the door  so nur al din rose to open it and one of his boon  companions followed him without being perceived   at the door he found his steward and asked him   what is the matter    and he answered   o my lord  what i dreaded for thee hath come to pass     how so     know that there remains not a dirham s worth  less or more in my hands   here are my daftars and account books showing both income and outlay and the registers of thine original property    when nur al din heard these words he bowed his head and said   there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah    when the man who had followed him privily to spy on him heard the steward s words  he returned to his friends and warned them saying   look ye well to what ye do  nur al din is penniless   and  as the young host came back to his guests  vexation showed itself in his face   thereupon one of the intimates rose  and  looking at the entertainer  said to him   o my lord  may be thou wilt give me leave to retire     and why so early retirement this day    asked he and the other answered him   my wife is in childbirth and i may not be absent from her  indeed i must return and see how she does    so he gave him leave  whereupon another rose and said   o my lord nur al din  i wish now to go to my brother s for he circumciseth his son to  day   fn 26   in short each and every asked permission to retire on some pretence or other  till all the ten were gone leaving nur al din alone   then he called his slave girl and said to her   o anis al jalis  hast thou seen what case is mine    and he related to her what the steward had told him   then quoth she   o my lord  for many nights i had it in my mind to speak with thee of this matter  but i heard thee repeating    when the world heaps favours on thee  pass on   thy favours to      friends ere her hand she stay  largesse never let her when fain she comes    nor niggardise kept      her from turning away    when i heard these verses i held my peace and cared not to exchange a word with thee     o anis al jalis   said nur al din   thou knowest that i have not wasted my wealth save on my friends  especially these ten who have now left me a pauper  and i think they will not abandon and desert me without relief     by allah   replied she   they will not profit thee with aught of aid    said he   i will rise at once and go to them and knock at their doors  it may be i shall get from them somewhat wherewith i may trade and leave pastime and pleasuring    so he rose without stay or delay  and repaired to a street wherein all his ten friends lived   he went up to the nearest door and knocked  whereupon a handmaid came out and asked him   who art thou    and he answered   tell thy master that nur al din ali standeth at the door and saith to him   thy slave kisseth thy hand and awaiteth thy bounty     the girl went in and told her master  who cried at her   go back and say   my master is not at home     so she returned to nur al din  and said to him   o my lord  my master is out    thereupon he turned away and said to himself   if this one be a whoreson knave and deny himself  another may not prove himself such knave and whoreson    then he went up to the next door and sent in a like message to the house master  who denied himself as the first had done  whereupon he began repeating    he is gone who when to his gate thou go st    fed thy famisht      maw with his boiled and roast    when he had ended his verse he said   by allah  there is no help but that i make trial of them all  perchance there be one amongst them who will stand me in the stead of all the rest    so he went the round of the ten  but not one of them would open his door to him or show himself or even break a bit of bread before him  whereupon he recited    like a tree is he who in wealth doth wone    and while fruits he      the folk to his fruit shall run  but when bared the tree of what fruit it bare    they leave it to      suffer from dust and sun  perdition to all of this age   i find   ten rogues for every      righteous one    then he returned to his slave girl and his grief had grown more grievous and she said to him   o my lord  did i not tell thee  none would profit thee with aught of aid    and he replied   by allah  not one of them would show me his face or know me     o my lord   quoth she   sell some of the moveables and household stuff  such as pots and pans  little by little  and expend the proceeds until allah almighty shall provide    so he sold all of that was in the house till nothing remained when he turned to anis al jalis and asked her  what shall we do now    and she answered   o my lord  it is my advice that thou rise forthwith and take me down to the bazar and sell me   thou knowest that they father bought me for ten thousand dinars  haply allah may open thee a way to get the same price  and if it be his will to bring us once more together  we shall meet again     o anis al  jalis   cried he   by allah it is no light matter for me to be parted from thee for a single hour     by allah  o my lord   she replied   nor is it easy to me either  but need hath its own law  as the poet said    need drives a man into devious roads    and pathways doubtful of      trend and scope  no man to a rope fn 27  will entrust his weight    save for cause      that calleth for case of rope     thereupon he rose to his feet and took her  fn 28  whilst the tears rolled down his cheek like rain  and he recited with the tongue of the case these lines    stay  grant one parting look before we part    nerving my heart      this severance to sustain  but  an this parting deal thee pain and bane    leave me to die      of love and spare thee pain    then he went down with her to the bazar and delivered her to the broker and said to him   o hajj hasan  fn 29  i pray thee note the value of her thou hast to cry for sale     o my lord nur al  din   quoth the broker   the fundamentals are remembered   fn 30  adding   is not this the anis al jalis whom thy father bought of me for ten thousand dinars    yes   said nur al din   thereupon the broker went round to the merchants  but found that all had not yet assembled   so he waited till the rest had arrived and the market was crowded with slave girls of all nations  turks  franks and circassians  abyssinians  nubians and takruris  fn 31  tartars  georgians and others  when he came forward and standing cried aloud   o merchants  o men of money  every round thing is not a walnut and every long thing a banana is not  all reds are not meat nor all whites fat  nor is every brown thing a date  fn 32   o merchants  i have here this union pearl that hath no price  at what sum shall i cry her    cry her at four thousand five hundred dinars   quoth one of the traders  the broker opened the door of sale at the sum named and  as he was yet calling  lo  the wazir al mu in bin sawi passed through the bazar and  seeing nur al din ali waiting at one side  said to himself   why is khakan s son fn 33  standing about here   hath this gallows bird aught remaining wherewith to buy slave girls    then he looked round and  seeing the broker calling out in the market with all the merchants around him  said to himself   i am sure that he is penniless and hath brought hither the damsel anis al jalis for sale   adding   o how cooling and grateful is this to my heart    then he called the crier  who came up and kissed the ground before him  and he said to him   i want this slave girl whom thou art calling for sale    the broker dared not cross him  so he answered   o my lord  bismillah  in allah s name so be it   and led forward the damsel and showed her to him   she pleased him much whereat he asked   o hasan  what is bidden for this girl   and he answered   four thousand five hundred dinars to open the door of sale   quoth al mu in   four thousand five hundred is my bid    when the merchants heard this  they held back and dared not bid another dirham  wotting what they did of the wazir s tyranny  violence and treachery  so al mu in looked at the broker and said to him   why stand still  go and offer four thousand dinars for me and the five hundred shall be for thyself    thereupon the broker went to nur al din and said   o my lord  thy slave is going for nothing     and how so   asked he  the broker answered   we had opened the biddings for her at four thousand five hundred dinars  when that tyrant  al mu in bin sawi  passed through the bazar and  as he saw the damsel she pleased him  so he cried to me   call me the buyer at four thousand dinars and thou shalt have five hundred for thyself    i doubt not but that he knoweth that the damsel if thine  and if he would pay thee down her price at once it were well  but i know his injustice and violence  he will give thee a written order upon some of his agents and will send after thee to say to them   pay him nothing    so as often as though shalt go in quest of the coin they will say   we ll pay thee presently   and they will put thee off day after day  and thou art proud of spirit  till at last  when they are wearied with thine importunity  they will say   show us the cheque   then  as soon as they have got hold of it they will tear it up and so thou wilt lose the girl s price   when nur al din heard this he looked at the broker and asked him   how shall this matter be managed    and he answered   i will give thee a counsel which  if thou follow  it shall bring thee complete satisfaction    and what is that   quoth nur al din  quoth the broker   come thou to me anon when i am standing in the middle of the market and  taking the girl from my hand  give her a sound cuffing and say to her   thou baggage  i have kept my vow and brought thee down to the slave market  because i swore an oath that i would carry thee from home to the bazar  and make brokers cry thee for sale    if thou do this  perhaps the device will impose upon the wazir and the people  and they will believe that thou broughtest her not to the bazar  but for the quittance of thine oath   he replied   such were the best way   then the broker left him and  returning into the midst of the market  took the damsel by the hand  and signed to the wazir and said   o my lord  here is her owner   with this up came nur al din ali and  snatching the girl from the broker s hand  cuffed her soundly and said to her   shame on thee  o thou baggage   i have brought thee to the bazar for quittance of mine oath  now get thee home and thwart me no more as is thy wont   woe to thee  do i need thy price  that i should sell thee  the furniture of my house would fetch thy value many times over   when al mu in saw this he said to nur al din   out on thee   hast thou anything left for selling or buying    and he would have laid violent hands upon him  but the merchants interposed  for they all loved nur al din   and the young man said to them   here am i in your hands and ye all know his tyranny     by allah   cried the wazir   but for you i had slain him    then all signed with significant eyes to nur al din as much as to say   take thy wreak of him  not one of us will come between thee and him    thereupon nur al din  who was stout of heart as he was stalwart of limb  went up to the wazir and  dragging him over the pommel of his saddle  threw him to the ground   now there was in that place a puddling  pit for brick  clay  fn 34  into the midst of which he fell  and nur al din kept pummelling and fisti cuffing him  and one of the blows fell full on his teeth  and his beard was dyed with his blood   also there were with the minister ten armed slaves who  seeing their master entreated after this fashion  laid hand on sword hilt and would have bared blades and fallen on nur al din to cut him down  but the merchants and bystanders said to them   this is a wazir and that is the son of a wazir  haply they will make friends some time or other  in which case you will forfeit the favour of both   or perchance a blow may befal your lord  and you will all die the vilest of deaths  so it were better for you not to interfere   accordingly they held aloof and  when nur al din had made an end of thrashing the wazir  he took his handmaid and fared homewards  al mu in also went his ways at once  with his raiment dyed of three colours  black with mud  red with blood and ash coloured with brick clay  when he saw himself in this state  he bound a bit of matting fn 35  round his neck and  taking in hand two bundles of coarse halfah grass  fn 36  went up to the palace and standing under the sultan s windows cried aloud   o king of the age  i am a wronged man   i am foully wronged    so they brought him before the king who looked at him  and behold  it was the chief minister  whereupon he said   o wazir who did this deed by thee    al mu in wept and sobbed and repeated these lines    shall the world oppress me when thou art in t    in the lion s      presence shall wolves devour  shall the dry all drink of thy tanks and i   under rain cloud      thirst for the cooling shower     o my lord   cried he   the like will befal every one who loveth and serveth thee well     be quick with thee   quoth the sultan   and tell me how this came to pass and who did this deed by one whose honour is part of my honour    quoth the wazir   know  o my lord  that i went out this day to the slave market to buy me a cookmaid  when i saw there a damsel  never in my life long saw i a fairer  and i designed to buy her for our lord the sultan  so i asked the broker of her and of her owner  and he answered   she belongeth to ali son of al fazl bin khakan   some time ago our lord the sultan gave his father ten thousand dinars wherewith to buy him a handsome slave girl  and he bought this maiden who pleased him  so he grudged her to our lord the sultan and gave her to his own son  when the father died  the son sold all he had of houses and gardens and household gear  and squandered the price till he was penniless   then he brought the girl to the market that he might sell her  and he handed her over to the broker to cry and the merchants bid higher and higher on her  until the price reached four thousand dinars  whereupon quoth i to myself   i will buy this damsel for our lord the sultan  whose money was paid for her    so i said to nur al din   o my son  sell her to me for four thousand dinars    when he heard my words he looked at me and cried   o ill omened oldster  i will sell her to a jew or to a nazarene  but i will not sell her to thee     i do not buy her for myself   said i   i buy her for our lord and benefactor the sultan    hearing my words he was filled with rage  and  dragging me off my horse  and i a very old man   beat me unmercifully with his fists and buffeted me with his palms till he left me as thou seest  and all this hath befallen me only because i thought to buy this damsel for thee    then the wazir threw himself on the ground and lay there weeping and shivering   when the sultan saw his condition and heard his story  the vein of rage started out between his eyes fn 37  and he turned to his body guard who stood before him  forty white slaves  smiters with the sword  and said to them   go down forthright to the house built by the son of khakan and sack it and raze it and bring to me his son nur al din with the damsel  and drag them both on their faces with their arms pinioned behind them    they replied   to hear is to obey   and  arming themselves  they set out for the house of nur al din ali   now about the sultan was a chamerlain  alam fn 38  al din sanjar hight  who had aforetime been mameluke to al fazl  but he had risen in the world and the sultan had advanced him to be one of his chamberlains   when he heard the king s command and saw the enemies make them ready to slay his old master s son  it was grievous to him  so he went out from before the sultan and  mounting his beast  rode to nur al  din s house and knocked at the door   nur al din came out and knowing him would have saluted him  but he said   o my master this is no time for greeting or treating   listen to what the poet said      fly  fly with thy life if by ill overtaken     let thy house speak thy death by its builder forsaken     for a land else than this land thou may st reach  my brother     but thy life tho lt ne er find in this world another    fn 39    o alam al din what cheer   asked nur al din  and he answered   rise quickly and fly for thy life  thou and the damsel  for al  mu in hath set a snare for you both  and  if you fall into his hands  he will slay you   the sultan hath despatched forty sworders against you and i counsel you to flee ere harm can hurt you    then sanjar put his hand to his purse and finding there forty gold pieces took them and gave them to nur al din  saying   o my lord receive these and journey with them   had i more i would give them to thee  but this is not the time to take exception   thereupon nur al din went in to the damsel and told her what had happened  at which she wrung her hands   then they fared forth at once from the city  and allah spread over them his veil of protection  so that they reached the river bank where they found a vessel ready for sea   her skipper was standing amidships and crying   whoso hath aught to do  whether in the way of provisioning or taking leave of his people  or whoso hath forgotten any needful thing  let him do it at once and return  for we are about to sail   and all of them saying   there is naught left to be done by us  o captain    he cried to his crew   hallo there  cast off the cable and pull up the mooring  pole   fn 40  quoth nur al din   whither bound  o captain   and quoth he   to the house of peace  baghdad    and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say                 when it was the thirty sixth night   she said  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that when the skipper answered   to the house of peace  baghdad   nur al din ali and the damsel went on board  and they launched the craft and shook out the sails  and the ship sped forth as though she were a bird on wing  even as said one of them and said right well    watch some tall ship  she ll joy the sight of thee    the breeze      outstripping in her haste to flee  as when a bird  with widely spreading wings    leaveth the sky to      settle on the sea    so the vessel sailed on her fastest and the wind to her was fairest  thus far concerning them  but as regards the mamelukes  they went to nur al din s mansion and  breaking open the doors  entered and searched the whole place  but could find no trace of him and the damsel  so they demolished the house and  returning to the sultan  reported their proceedings  whereupon quoth he   make search for them both  wherever they may be   and they answered   hearing is obeying    the wazir al mu in had also gone home after the sultan had bestowed upon him a robe of honour  and had set his heart at rest by saying   none shall take blood wreak for thee save i   and he had blessed the king and prayed for his long life and prosperity   then the sultan bade proclaim about the city   oyez  o ye lieges one and all   it is the will of our lord the sultan that whoso happeneth on nur al din ali son of al  fazl bin khakan  and bringeth him to the sultan  shall receive a robe of honour and one thousand gold pieces  and he who hideth him or knoweth his abiding place and informeth not  deserveth whatsoever pains and penalties shall befal him    so all began to search for nur al din ali  but they could find neither trace nor tidings of him   meanwhile he and his handmaid sailed on with the wind right aft  till they arrived in safety at baghdad  and the captain said to them   this is baghdad and  tis the city where security is to be had  winter with his frosts hath turned away and prime hath come his roses to display  and the flowers are a  glowing and the trees are blowing and the streams are flowing    so nur al din landed  he and his handmaid and  giving the captain five dinars  walked on a little way till the decrees of destiny brought them among the gardens  and they came to a place swept and sprinkled  with benches along the walls and hanging jars filled with water  fn 41   overhead was a trellis of reed work and canes shading the whole length of the avenue  and at the upper end was a garden gate  but this was locked    by allah   quoth nur al din to the damsel   right pleasant is this place    and she replied   o my lord sit with me a while on this bench and let us take our ease    so they mounted and sat them down on the bench  after which they washed their faces and hands  and the breeze blew cool on them and they fell asleep and glory be to him who never sleepeth   not this garden was named the garden of gladness fn 42  and therein stood a belvedere hight the palace of pleasure and the pavilion of pictures  the whole belonging to the caliph harun al rashid who was wont  when his breast was straitened with care  to frequent garden and palace and there to sit   the palace had eighty latticed windows and fourscore lamps hanging round a great candelabrum of gold furnished with wax  candles  and  when the caliph used to enter  he would order the handmaids to throw open the lattices and light up the rooms  and he would bid ishak bin ibrahim the cup companion and the slave  girls to sing till his breast was broadened and his ailments were allayed   now the keeper of the garden  shaykh ibrahim  was a very old man  and he had found from time to time  when he went out on any business  people pleasuring about the garden gate with their bona robas  at which he was angered with exceeding anger  fn 43   but he took patience till one day when the caliph came to his garden  and he complained of this to harun al rashid who said   whomsoever thou surprisest about the door of the garden  deal with him as thou wilt    now on this day the gardener chanced to be abroad on some occasion and returning found these two sleeping at the gate covered with a single mantilla  whereupon said he   by allah  good   these twain know not that the caliph hath given me leave to slay anyone i may catch at the door  but i will give this couple a shrewd whipping  that none may come near the gate in future    so he cut a green palm frond fn 44  and went up to them and  raising his arm till the white of his arm pit appeared  was about to strike them  when he bethought himself and said   o ibrahim  wilt thou beat them unknowing their case   haply they are strangers or of the sons of the road  fn 45  and the decrees of destiny have thrown them here   i will uncover their faces and look at them    so he lifted up the mantilla from their heads and said   they are a handsome couple  it were not fitting that i should beat them    then he covered their faces again and  going to nur al din s feet  began to rub and shampoo them  fn 46  whereupon the youth opened his eyes and  seeing an old man of grave and reverend aspect rubbing his feet  he was ashamed and drawing them in  sat up   then he took shaykh ibrahim s hand and kissed it   quoth the old man   o my son  whence art thou    and quoth he   o my lord  we two are strangers   and the tears started from his eyes    o my son   said shaykh ibrahim   know that the prophet  whom allah bless and preserve   hath enjoined honour to the stranger   and added   wilt not thou arise  o my son  and pass into the garden and solace thyself by looking at it and gladden thy heart     o my lord   said nur al din   to whom doth this garden belong    and the other replied   o my son  i have inherited it from my folk    now his object in saying this was to set them at their ease and induce them to enter the garden   so nur al din thanked him and rose  he and the damsel  and followed him into the garden  and lo  it was a garden  and what a garden   the gate was arched like a great hall and over walls and roof ramped vines with grapes of many colours  the red like rubies and the black like ebonies  and beyond it lay a bower of trelliced boughs growing fruits single and composite  and small birds on branches sang with melodious recite  and the thousand noted nightingale shrilled with her varied shright  the turtle with her cooing filled the site  the blackbird whistled like human wight fn 47  and the ring dove moaned like a drinker in grievous plight   the trees grew in perfection all edible growths and fruited all manner fruits which in pairs were bipartite  with the camphor  apricot  the almond apricot and the apricot  khorasani  hight  the plum  like the face of beauty  smooth and bright  the cherry that makes teeth shine clear by her sleight  and the fig of three colours  green  purple and white   there also blossomed the violet as it were sulphur on fire by night  the orange with buds like pink coral and marguerite  the rose whose redness gars the loveliest cheeks blush with despight  and myrtle and gilliflower and lavender with the blood red anemone from nu uman hight   the leaves were all gemmed with tears the clouds had dight  the chamomile smiled showing teeth that bite  and narcissus with his negro fn 48  eyes fixed on rose his sight  the citrons shone with fruits embowled and the lemons like balls of gold  earth was carpeted with flowers tinctured infinite  for spring was come brightening the place with joy and delight  and the streams ran ringing  to the birds  gay singing  while the rustling breeze upspringing attempered the air to temperance exquisite   shaykh ibrahim carried them up into the pavilion  and they gazed on its beauty  and on the lamps aforementioned in the latticed windows  and nur al din  remembering his entertainments of time past  cried   by allah  this is a pleasant place  it hath quenched in me anguish which burned as a fire of ghaza wood  fn 49    then they sat down and shaykh ibrahim set food before them  and they ate till they were satisfied and washed their hands  after which nur al din went up to one of the latticed windows  and  calling to his handmaid fell to gazing on the trees laden with all manner fruits   presently he turned to the gardener and said to him   o shaykh ibrahim hast thou no drink here  for folk are wont to drink after eating    the shaykh brought him sweet water  cool and pleasant  but he said   this is not the kind of drink i wanted    perchance thou wishest for wine     indeed i do  o shaykh     i seek refuge from it with allah  it is thirteen years since i did this thing  for the prophet  abhak fn 50   cursed its drinker  presser  seller and carrier     hear two words of me     say on     if yon cursed ass fn 51  which standeth there be cursed  will aught of his curse alight upon thee    by no means     then take this dinar and these two dirhams and mount yonder ass and  halting afar from the wine shop  call the first man thou seest buying liquor and say to him   take these two dirhams for thyself  and with this dinar buy me some wine and set it on the ass   so shalt thou be neither the presser  nor the buyer  nor the carrier  and no part of the curse will fall  upon thee    at this shaykh ibrahim laughed and said   by allah  o my son  i never saw one wilier of wit than thou art  nor heard aught sweeter than thy speech    so he did as he was bidden by nur al  din who thanked him and said   we two are now dependent on thee  and it is only meet that thou comply with our wishes  so bring us here what we require     o my son   replied he   this is my buttery before thee   and it was the store room provided for the commander of the faithful    so go in  and take whatso thou wilt  for there is over and above what thou wantest    nur al din then entered the pantry and found therein vessels of gold and silver and crystal set with all kinds of gems  and was amazed and delighted with what he saw   then he took out what he needed and set it on and poured the wine into flagons and glass ewers  whilst shaykh ibrahim brought them fruit and flowers and aromatic herbs  then the old man withdrew and sat down at a distance from them  whilst they drank and made merry  till the wine got the better of them  so that their cheeks reddened and their eyes wantoned like the gazelle s  and their locks became dishevelled and their brightness became yet more beautiful   then said shaykh ibrahim to himself   what aileth me to sit apart from them   why should i not sit with them   when shall i ever find myself in company with the like of these two that favour two moons   so he stepped forward and sat down on the edge of the dais  and nur al  din said to him   o my lord  my life on thee  come nearer to us    he came and sat by them  when nur al din filled a cup and looked towards the shaykh and said to him   drink  that thou mayest try the taste of it    i take refuge from it with allah   replied he   for thirteen years i have not done a thing of the kind    nur al din feigned to forget he was there and  drinking off the cup  threw himself on the ground as if the drink had overcome him  whereupon anis al jalis glanced at him and said   o shaykh ibrahim see how this husband of mine treateth me   and he answered   o my lady  what aileth him     this is how he always serveth me   cried she   he drinketh awhile  then falleth asleep and leaveth me alone with none to bear me company over my cup nor any to whom i may sing when the bowl goeth round    quoth the shaykh  and his mien unstiffened for that his soul inclined towards her    by allah  this is not well   then she crowned a cup and looking towards him said   by my life thou must take and drink it  and not refuse to heal my sick heart    so he put forth his hand and took it and drank it off and she filled a second and set it on the chandelier and said   o master mine  there is still this one left for thee     by allah  i cannot drink it   cried he   what i have already drunk is enough for me   but she rejoined   by allah  there is no help for it    so he took the cup and drank  and she filled him a third which he took and was about to drink when behold  nur al din rolled round and sat upright   and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say                when it was the thirty seventh night   she said  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that nur al din sat upright and said   ho  shaykh ibrahim  what is this   did i not adjure thee a while ago and thou refusedst  saying   what i   tis thirteen years ago since i have done such a thing      by allah   quoth the shaykh  and indeed he was abashed    no sin of mine this  she forced me to do it   nur al din laughed and they sat down again to wine and wassail  but the damsel turned to her master and said in a whisper   o my lord  drink and do not press him  that i may show thee some sport with him    then she began to fill her master s cup and he hers and so they did time after time  till at last shaykh ibrahim looked at them and said   what fashion of good fellowship is this   allah curse the glutton who keepeth the cup to himself   why dost thou not give me to drink  o my brother  what manners are these  o blessed one    at this the two laughed until they fell on their backs  then they drank and gave him to drink and ceased not their carousal till a third part of the night was past   then said the damsel   o shaykh ibrahim  with thy leave i will get up and light one of these candles     do so   he replied   but light no more than one   so she sprang to her feet and  beginning with one candle  lighted all the eighty and sat down again   presently nur al din said   o shaykh ibrahim  in what favour am i with thee   may i not light one of these lamps    light one   replied he   and bother me no more in thy turn    so he rose and lighted one lamp after another  till he had lighted the whole eight and the palace seemed to dance with brilliancy   quoth the shaykh  and indeed intoxication had overcome him    ye two are bolder than i am   then he rose to his feet and opened all the lattices and sat down again  and they fell to carousing and reciting verses till the place rang with their noisy mirth   now allah  the decreer who decreeth all things and who for every effect appointeth a cause  had so disposed that the caliph was at that moment sitting in the light of the moon at one of the windows of his palace overlooking the tigris   he saw the blaze of the lamps and wax candles reflected in the river and  lifting his eyes  perceived that it came from the garden palace which was all ablaze with brilliancy  so he cried   here to me with ja afar the barmaki    and the last word was hardly spoken ere the wazir was present before the commander of the faithful  who cried at him   o dog of a minister  hast thou taken from me this city of baghdad without saying aught to me     what words are these words   asked ja afar  and the caliph answered   if baghdad city were not taken from me  the palace of pictures would not be illuminated with lamps and candles  nor would its windows be thrown open   woe to thee  who durst do a deed like this except the caliphate had been taken from me   quoth ja afar  and indeed his side muscles trembled as he spoke    who told thee that the palace of pictures was illuminated and the windows thrown open     come hither and see   replied the caliph   then ja afar came close to the caliph and  looking towards the garden  saw the palace blazing with illumination that rayed through the gloom of the night  and  thinking that this might have been permitted by the keeper for some reason of his own  he wished to make an excuse for him  so quoth he   o commander of the faithful  shaykh ibrahim said to me last week   o my lord ja afar  i much wish to circumcise my sons during the life of the commander of the faithful and thy life    i asked   what dost thou want    and he answered   get me leave from the caliph to hold the festival in the garden palace   so said i to him   go circumcise them and i will see the caliph and tell him    thereupon he went away and i forgot to let thee know     o ja afar   said the caliph   thou hast committed two offences against me  first in that thou didst no report to me  secondly  thou didst not give him what he sought  for he came and told thee this only as excuse to ask for some small matter of money  to help him with the outlay  and thou gavest him nothing nor toldest me     o commander of the faithful   said ja afar   i forgot     now by the rights of my forefathers and the tombs of my forbears   quoth the caliph   i will not pass the rest of this night save in company with him  for truly he is a pious man who frequenteth the elders of the faith and the fakirs and other religious mendicants and entertaineth them  doubtless they are not assembled together and it may be that the prayer of one of them will work us weal both in this world and in the next   besides  my presence may profit and at any rate be pleasing to shaykh ibrahim     o commander of the faithful   quoth ja afar   the greater part of the night is passed  and at this time they will be breaking up    quoth the caliph   it matters not  i needs must go to them    so ja afar held his peace  being bewildered and knowing not what to do   then the caliph rose to his feet and  taking with him ja afar and masrur the eunuch sworder  the three disguised themselves in merchants  gear and leaving the city palace  kept threading the streets till they reached the garden  the caliph went up to the gate and finding it wide open  was surprised and said   see  o ja afar  how shaykh ibrahim hath left the gate open at this hour contrary to his custom    they went in and walked on till they came under the pavilion  when the caliph said   o ja afar  i wish to look in upon them unawares before i show myself  that i may see what they are about and get sight of the elders  for hitherto i have heard no sound from them  nor even a fakir calling upon the name of allah  fn 52    then he looked about and  seeing a tall walnut tree  said to ja afar   i will climb this tree  for its branches are near the lattices and so look in upon them    thereupon he mounted the tree and ceased not climbing from branch to branch  till he reached a bough which was right opposite one of the windows  and here he took seat and looked inside the palace  he saw a damsel and a youth as they were two moons  glory be to him who created them and fashioned them    and by them shaykh ibrahim seated cup in hand and saying   o princess of fair ones  drinking without music is nothing worth  indeed i have heard a poet say    round with bit and little  the bowl and cup    take either than      moon fn 53  in his sheen hath crowned  nor drink without music  for oft i ve seen    the horse drink      best to the whistle s sound     when the caliph saw this  the vein of wrath started up between his eyes and he came down and said to the wazir   o ja afar  never beheld i yet men of piety in such case  so do thou mount this tree and look upon them  lest the blessings of the blest be lost to thee    ja afar  hearing the words of the commander of the faithful and being confounded by them  climbed to the tree  top and looking in  saw nur al din and the damsel  and shaykh ibrahim holding in his hand a brimming bowl   at this sight he made sure of death and  descending  stood before the commander of the faithful  who said to him   o ja afar  praise be to allah who hath made us of those that observe external ordinances of holy law and hath averted from us the sin of disguising ourselves after the manner of hypocrites   fn 54   but ja afar could not speak a word for excess of confusion  so the caliph looked at him and said   i wonder how they came hither  and who admitted them into my pavilion   but aught like the beauty of this youth and this damsel my eyes never yet saw     thou sayest sooth  o our lord the sultan   replied ja afar  and he hoped to propitiate the caliph harun al rashid    then quoth the caliph   o ja afar  let us both mount the branch opposite the window  that we may amuse ourselves with looking at them    so the two climbed the tree and  peering in  heard shaykh ibrahim say   o my lady  i have cast away all gravity mine by the drinking of wine  but  tis not sweet save with the soft sounds of the lute strings it combine     by allah   replied anis al jalis   o shaykh ibrahim  an we had but some instrument of music our joyance were complete    hearing this he rose to his feet and the caliph said to ja afar   i wonder what he is about to do   and ja afar answered   i know not    the shaykh disappeared and presently reappeared bringing a lute  and the caliph took not of it and knew it for that of abu ishak the cup companion  fn 55    by allah   said the caliph   if this damsel sing ill i will crucify all of you  but if she sing well i will forgive them and only gibbet thee     o allah cause her to sing vilely   quoth ja afar  asked the caliph   why so    and he answered   if thou crucify us all together  we shall keep one another company    the caliph laughed at his speech   presently the damsel took the lute and  after looking at it and tuning it  she played a measure which made all hearts yearn to her  then she sang these lines    o ye that can aid me  a wretched lover    whom longing burns nor      can rest restore me  though all you have done i have well deserved    i take refuge      with you  so exult not o er me  true  i am weak and low and vile    but i ll bear your will and      whatso you bore me  my death at your hands what brings it of glory    i fear but your      sin which of life forlore me    quoth the caliph   by allah  good   o ja afar  never in my life have i heard a voice so enchanting as this     then haply the caliph s wrath hath passed away   said ja afar  and he replied   yes   tis gone    thereupon they descended from the tree  and the caliph said to ja afar   i wish to go in and sit with them and hear the damsel sing before me    o commander of the faithful   replied ja afar   if thou go in to them they will be terribly troubled  and shaykh ibrahim will assuredly die of fright    but the caliph answered   o ja afar  thou must teach me some device wherewith to delude them and whereby i can foregather with them without their knowing me    so they walked towards the tigris pondering the matter  and presently came upon a fisherman who stood fishing under the pavilion windows   now some time before this  the caliph  being in the pavilion  had called to shaykh ibrahim and asked him   what noise is this i hear under the windows   and he had answered   it is voices of fisher folk catching fish   so quoth the caliph   go down and forbid them this place   and he forbade them accordingly   however that night a fisherman named karim  happening to pass by and seeing the garden gate open  said to himself   this is a time of negligence  and i will take advantage of it to do a bit of fishing    so he took his net and cast it  but he had hardly done so when behold  the caliph come up single handed and  standing hard by  knew him and called aloud to him   ho  karim    the fisherman  hearing himself named  turned round  and seeing the caliph  trembled and his side muscles quivered  as he cried   by allah  o commander of the faithful  i did it not in mockery of the mandate  but poverty and a large family drove me to what thou seest    quoth the caliph   make a cast in my name    at this the fisherman was glad and going to the bank threw his net  then waiting till it had spread out at full stretch and settled down  hauled it up and found in it various kinds of fish   the caliph was pleased and said   o karim  doff thy habit    so he put off a gaberdine of coarse woollen stuff patched in an hundred places whereon the lice were rampant  and a turband which had never been untwisted for three years but to which he had sown every rag he came upon   the caliph also pulled off his person two vests of alexandrian and ba lbak silk  a loose inner robe and a long sleeved outer coat  and said to the fisherman   take them and put them on   while he assumed the foul gaberdine and filthy turband and drew a corner of the head cloth as a mouth veil fn 56  before his face  then said he to the fisherman   get thee about thy business   and the man kissed the caliph s feet and thanked him and improvised the following couplets     thou hast granted more favours than ever i craved    thou hast      satisfied needs which my heart enslaved  i will thank thee and thank whileas life shall last    and my      bones will praise thee in grave engraved    hardly had the fisherman ended his verse  when the lice began to crawl over the caliph s skin  and he fell to catching them on his neck with his right and left and throwing them from him  while he cried   o fisherman  woe to thee  what be this abundance of lice on thy gaberdine    o my lord   replied he   they may annoy thee just at first  but before a week is past thou wilt not feel them nor think of them    the caliph laughed and said to him   out on thee   shall i leave this gaberdine of thine so long on my body    quoth the fisherman   i would say a word to thee but i am ashamed in presence of the caliph    and quoth he   say what thou hast to say     it passed through my thought  o commander of the faithful   said the fisherman   that  since thou wishest to learn fishing so thou mayest have in hand an honest trade whereby to gain thy livelihood  this my gaberdine besitteth thee right well   fn 57  the commander of the faithful laughed at this speech  and the fisherman went his way   then the caliph took up the basket of fish and  strewing a little green grass over it  carried it to ja afar and stood before him  ja afar thinking him to be karim the fisherman feared for him and said   o karim  what brought thee hither   flee for thy life  for the caliph is in the garden to night and  if he see thee  thy neck is gone    at this the caliph laughed and ja afar recognized him and asked   can it be thou  our lord the sultan    and he answered   yes  o ja afar  and thou art my wazir and i and thou came hither together  yet thou knowest me not  so how should shaykh ibrahim know me  and he drunk   stay here  till i came back to thee     to hear is to obey   said ja afar   then the caliph went up to the door of the pavilion and knocked a gentle knock  whereupon said nur al din   o shaykh ibrahim  some one taps at the door    who goes there   cried the shaykh and the caliph replied   it is i  o shaykh ibrahim     who art thou   quoth he  and quoth the other   i am karim the fisherman  i hear thou hast a feast  so i have brought thee some fish  and of a truth  tis good fish    when nur al din heard the mention of fish  he was glad  he and the damsel  and they both said to the shaykh   o our lord  open the door and let him bring us his fish   so shaykh ibrahim opened and the caliph came in  and he in fisherman guise   and began by saluting them   said shaykh ibrahim   welcome to the blackguard  the robber  the dicer   let us see thy fish    so the caliph showed them his catch and behold  the fishes were still alive and jumping  whereupon the damsel exclaimed   by allah   o my lord  these are indeed fine fish  would they were fried   and shaykh ibrahim rejoined   by allah  o my lady  thou art right    then said he to the caliph   o fisherman  why didst thou not bring us the fish ready fried   up now and cook them and bring them back to us     on my head be thy commands   said the caliph   i will fry thee a dish and bring it    said they   look sharp   thereupon he went and ran till he came up to ja afar when he called to him   hallo  ja afar    and he replied   here am i  o commander of the faithful  is all well     they want the fish fried   said the caliph  and ja afar answered   o commander of the faithful  give it to me and i ll fry it for them     by the tombs of my forbears   quoth the caliph   none shall fry it but i  with mine own hand    so he went to the gardener s hut  where he searched and found all that he required  even to salt and saffron and wild marjoram and else besides   then he turned to the brasier and  setting on the frying pan  fried a right good fry   when it was done  he laid it on a banana leaf  and gathering from the garden wind fallen fruits  limes and lemons  carried the fish to the pavilion and set the dish before them   so the youth and the damsel and shaykh ibrahim came forward and ate  after which they washed their hands and nur al din said to the caliph   by allah  o fisherman  thou hast done us a right good deed this night    then he put hand in pouch and  taking out three of the dinars which sanjar had given him  said   o fisherman  excuse me   by allah had i known thee before that which hath lately befallen me  i had done away the bitterness of poverty from thy heart  but take thou this as the best i can do for thee    then he threw the gold pieces to the caliph  who took them and kissed them and put them in pouch  now his sole object in doing all this was to hear the damsel sing  so he said to nur al din   thou hast rewarded me most liberally  but i beg of thy boundless bounty that thou let this damsel sing an air  that i may hear her   fn 58   so nur al  din said   o anis al jalis   and she answered  yes   and he continued   by my life  sing us something for the sake of this fisherman who wisheth so much to hear thee   thereupon she took the lute and struck the strings  after she had screwed them tight and tuned them  and sang these improvised verses    the fawn of a maid hent her lute in hand   and her music made us      right mettlesome  for her song gave hearing to ears stone deaf    while brava       brava  exclaimed the dumb    then she played again and played so ravishingly  that she charmed their wits and burst out improvising and singing these couplets    you have honoured us visiting this our land    and your      splendour illumined the glooms that blent  so  tis due that for you i perfume my place   with rose water       musk and the camphor scent    hereupon the caliph was agitated  and emotion so overpowered him that he could not command himself for excess of pleasure  and he exclaimed   by allah  good  by allah  good  by allah  good   fn 59   asked nur al din   o fisherman  doth this damsel please thee   and the caliph answered   ay  by allah    whereupon said nur al din   she is a gift to thee  a gift of the generous who repenteth him not of his givings and who will never revoke his gift    then he sprang to his feet and  taking a loose robe  threw it over the fisherman and bade him receive the damsel and be gone   but she looked at him and said   o my lord  art thou faring forth without farewell   if it must be so  at least stay till i bid thee good bye and make known my case    and she began versifying in these verses     when love and longing and regret are mine    must not this body      show of ills a sign  my love  say not   thou soon shalt be consoled     when state      speaks state none shall allay my pine  if living man could swim upon his tears    i first should float      on waters of these eyne  o thou  who in my heart infusedst thy love    as water mingles in      the cup with wine  this was the fear i feared  this parting blow    o thou whose      love my heart core ne er shall tyne  o bin khakan  my sought  my hope  my will    o thou whose love      this breast make wholly thine  against thy lord the king thou sinn dst for me    and winnedst      exile in lands peregrine  allah ne er make my lord repent my loss   to cream fn 60  o  men      thou gavest me  one right digne    when she had ended her verses  nur al din answered her with these lines    she bade me farewell on our parting day    and she wept in the      fire of our bane and pains   what wilt thou do when fro  thee i m gone     quoth i   say this      to whom life remains     when the caliph heard her saying in her verse       to karim  the cream of men thou gavest me    his inclination for her redoubled and it seemed a hard matter and a grievous to part them  so quoth he to the youth   o my lord  truly the damsel said in her verses that thou didst transgress against her master and him who owned her  so tell me  against whom didst thou transgress and who is it hath a claim on thee     by allah  o fisherman   replied nur al din   there befel me and this damsel a wondrous tale and a marvellous matter  an  t were graven with needle gravers on the eye corners it would be a warner to whoso would be warned    cried the caliph   wilt thou not tell me thy story and acquaint me with thy case  haply it may bring thee relief  for allah s aid is ever nearhand    o fisherman   said nur al din   wilt thou hear our history in verse or in prose     prose is a wordy thing  but verses   rejoined the caliph   are pearls on string    then nur al din bowed his head  and made these couplets    o my friend  reft of rest no repose i command    and my grief is      redoubled in this far land  erst i had a father  a kinder ne er was    but he died and to      death paid the deodand  when he went from me  every matter went wrong   till my heart was      nigh broken  my nature unmanned  he bought me a handmaid  a sweeting who shamed   a wand of the      willow by zephyr befanned  i lavisht upon her mine heritage    and spent like a nobleman      puissant and grand  then to sell her compelled  my sorrow increased    the parting      was sore but i mote not gainstand  now as soon as the crier had called her  there bid   a wicked old      fellow  a fiery brand  so i raged with a rage that i could not restrain    and snatched      her from out of his hireling s hand  when the angry curmudgeon made ready for blows    and the fire of      a fight kindled he and his band  i smote him in fury with right and with left    and his hide       till well satisfied  curried and tanned  then in fear i fled forth and lay hid in my house    to escape      from the snares which my foeman had spanned  so the king of the country proclaimed my arrest    when access to      me a good chamberlain fand  and warned me to flee from the city afar    disappear  disappoint      what my enemies planned  then we fled from our home  neath the wing of the night    and      sought us a refuge by baghdad strand  of my riches i ve nothing on thee to bestow    o fisher  except      the fair gift thou hast scanned  the loved of my soul  and when i from her part    know for sure      that i give thee the blood of my heart   fn 61   when he had ended his verse  the caliph said to him   o my lord nur al din  explain to me thy case more fully    so he told him the whole story from beginning to end  and the caliph said to him   whither dost thou now intend     allah s world is wide   replied he   quoth the caliph   i will write thee a letter to carry to the sultan mohammed bin sulayman al zayni  which when he readeth  he will not hurt nor harm thee in aught    and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say                when it was the thirty eighth night    she continued  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that when the caliph said to nur al din ali   i will write thee a letter to carry to the sultan mohammed bin sulayman al zayni  which when he readeth  he will not hurt nor harm thee in aught   nur al din asked  what  is there in the world a fisherman who writeth to kings   such a thing can never be    and the caliph answered   thou sayest sooth  but i will tell thee the reason  know that i and he learnt in the same school under one schoolmaster  and that i was his monitor   since that time fortune befriended him and he is become a sultan  while allah hath abased me and made me a fisherman  yet i never send to him to ask aught but he doeth my desire  nay  though i should ask of him a thousand favours every day  he would comply   when nur al din heard this he said   good  write that i may see   so the caliph took ink case and reed pen and wrote as follows    in the name of allah  the compassionating  the compassionate   but after  fn 62  this letter is written by harun al rashid  son of al mahdi  to his highness mohammed bin sulayman al zayni  whom i have encompassed about with my favour and made my viceroy in certain of my dominions   the bearer of these presents is nur al din ali  son of fazl bin khakan the wazir  as soon as they come to thy hand divest thyself forthright of the kingly dignity and invest him therewith  so oppose not my commandment and peace be with thee    he gave the letter to nur al din  who took it and kissed it  then put it in his turband and set out at once on his journey  so far concerning him  but as regards the caliph  shaykh ibrahim stared to him  and he still in fisher garb  and said   o vilest of fishermen  thou hast brought us a couple of fish worth a score of half dirhams  fn 63  and hast gotten three dinars for them  and thinkest thou to take the damsel to boot    when the caliph heard this  he cried out at him  and signed to masrur who discovered himself and rushed in upon him  now ja afar had sent one of the gardener lads to the doorkeeper of the palace to fetch a suit of royal raiment for the prince of the faithful  so the man went and  returning with the suit  kissed the ground before the caliph and gave it him   then he threw of the clothes he had on fn 64  and donned kingly apparel   shaykh ibrahim was still sitting upon his chair and the caliph tarried to behold what would come next   but seeing the fisherman become the caliph  shaykh ibrahim was utterly confounded and he could do nothing but bite his finger  ends fn 65  and say   would i knew whether am i asleep or am i awake    at last the caliph looked at him and cried   o shaykh ibrahim  what state is this in which i see thee   thereupon he recovered from his drunkenness and  throwing himself upon the ground  repeated these verses    pardon the sinful ways i did pursue    ruth from his lord to      every slave is due  confession pays the fine that sin demands    where  then  is that      which grace and mercy sue   fn 66   the caliph forgave him and bade carry the damsel to the city  palace  where he set apart for her an apartment and appointed slaves to serve her  saying to her   know that we have sent thy lord to be sultan in bassorah and  almighty allah willing  we will dispatch him the dress of investiture and thee with it    meanwhile  nur al din ali ceased not travelling till he reached bassorah  where he repaired to the sultan s palace and he shouted a long shout  fn 67   the sultan heard him and sent for him  and when he came into his presence  he kissed the ground between his hands and  producing the letter  presented it to him   seeing the superscription in the writing of the commander of the faithful  the sultan rose to his feet and kissed it three times  and after reading it said   i hear and i obey allah almighty and the commander of the faithful    then he summoned the four kazis fn 68  and the emirs and was about to divest himself of the rule royal  when behold  in came al mu in bin sawi   the sultan gave him the caliph s letter and he read it  then tore it to pieces and putting it into his mouth  chewed it fn 69  and spat it out    woe to thee   quoth the sultan  and indeed he was sore angered    what induced thee to do this deed     now by thy life  o our lord the sultan   replied mu in   this man hath never foregathered with the caliph nor with his wazir  but he is a gallows bird  a limb of satan  a knave who  having come upon a written paper in the caliph s hand  some idle scroll  hath made it serve his own end   the caliph would surely not send him to take the sultanate from thee without the imperial autograph fn 70  and the diploma of investiture  and he certainly would have despatched with him a chamberlain or a minister   but he hath come alone and he never came from the caliph  no  never  never  never     what is to be done   asked the sultan  and the minister answered   leave him to me and i will take him and keep him away from thee  and send him in charge of a chamberlain to baghdad city   then  if what he says be sooth  they will bring us back autograph and investiture  and if not  i will take my due out of this debtor    when the sultan heard the minister s words he said   hence with thee and him too   al mu in took trust of him from the king and  carrying him to his own house  cried out to his pages who laid him flat and beat him till he fainted   then he let put upon his feet heavy shackles and carried him to the jail  where he called the jailor  one kutayt  fn 71  who came and kissed the ground before him   quoth the wazir   o kutayt  i wish thee to take this fellow and throw him into one of the underground cells fn 72  in the prison and torture him night and day     to hear is to obey   replied the jailor and  taking nur al din into the prison  locked the door upon him   then he gave orders to sweep a bench behind the door and  spreading on it a sitting rug and a leather cloth  seated nur al din thereon and loosed his shackles and entreated him kindly   the wazir sent every day enjoining the jailor to beat him  but he abstained from this  and so continued to do for forty days   on the forty first day there came a present from the caliph  which when the sultan saw  it pleased him and he consulted his ministers on the matter  when one of them said   perchance this present was for the new sultan    cried al mu in   we should have done well had we put him to death at his first coming   and the sultan cried  by allah  thou hast reminded me of him   go down to the prison and fetch him  and i will strike off his head     to hear is to obey   replied al mu in  then he stood up and said   i will make proclamation in the city   whoso would solace himself with seeing the beheading of nur al din bin al fazl bin khakan  let him repair to the palace   so follower and followed  great and small will flock to the spectacle  and i shall heal my heart and harm my foe     do as thou wilt   said the sultan   the wazir went off  and he was glad and gay   and ordered the chief of police to make the afore mentioned proclamation  when the people heard the crier  they all sorrowed and wept  even the little ones at school and the traders in their shops  and some strove to get places for seeing the sight  whilst others went to the prison with the object of escorting him thence   presently  the wazir came with ten mamelukes to the jail and kutayt the jailor asked him   whom seekest thou  o our lord the wazir    whereto he answered   bring me out that gallows  bird    but the jailor said   he is in the sorriest of plights for the much beating i have given him    then he went into the prison and found nur al din repeating these verses    who shall support me in calamities    when fail all cures and      greater cares arise  exile hath worm my heart  my vitals torn    the world to foes      hath turned my firm allies  o folk  will not one friend amidst you all   wail o er my woes       and cry to hear my cries  death and it agonies seem light to me    since life has lost all      joys and jollities  o lord of mustafa  fn 73  that science sea    sole intercessor       guide all ware  all wise  i pray thee free me and my fault forego    and from me drive mine      evil and my woe    the jailor stripped off his clean clothes and  dressing him in two filthy vests  carried him to the wazir   nur al din looked at him and saw it was his foe that sought to compass his death  so he wept and said   art thou  then  so secure against the world   hast thou not heard the saying of the poet    kisras and caesars in a bygone day   stored wealth  where it is       and ah  where are they    o wazir   he continued   know that allah  be he extolled and exalted   will do whatso he will     o ali   replied he   thinkest thou to frighten me with such talk   i mean this very day to smite thy neck despite the noses of the bassorah folk and i care not  let the days do as they please  nor will i turn me to thy counsel but rather to what the poet saith    leave thou the days to breed their ban and bate    and make thee      strong t  upbear the weight of fate    and also how excellently saith another    whoso shall see the death day of his foe    one day surviving       wins his bestest wish     then he ordered his attendants to mount nur al din upon the bare back of a mule  and they said to the youth  for truly it was irksome to them    let us stone him and cut him down thou our lives go for it    but nur al din said to them   do not so  have ye not heard the saying of the poet    needs must i bear the term by fate decreed    and when that day      be dead needs must i die  if lions dragged me to their forest lair    safe should i live      till draw my death day nigh     then they proceeded to proclaim before nur al din   this is the least of the retribution for him who imposeth upon kings with forgeries    and they ceased not parading him round about bassorah  till they made him stand beneath the palace windows and set him upon the leather of blood  fn 74  and the sworder came up to him and said   o my lord  i am but a slave commanded in this matter  an thou have any desire  tell it me that i may fulfil it  for now there remaineth of they life only so much as may be till the sultan shall put his face out of the lattice    thereupon nur al din looked to the right and to the left  and before him and behind him and began improvising    the sword  the sworder and the blood skin waiting me i sight         and cry  alack  mine evil fate  ah  my calamity  how is t i see no loving friend with eye of sense or soul         what  no one here  i cry to all  will none reply to me  the time is past that formed my life  my death term draweth nigh         will no man win the grace of god showing me clemency  and look with pity on my state  and clear my dark despair    e en      with a draught of water dealt to cool death s agony    the people fell to weeping over him  and the headsman rose and brought him a draught of water  but the wazir sprang up from his place and smote the gugglet with his hand and broke it  then he cried out at the executioner and bade him strike off nur al din s head   so he bound the eyes of the doomed man and folk clamoured at the wazir and loud wailings were heard and much questioning of man and man   at this moment behold  rose a dense dust cloud filling sky and wold  and when the sultan  who was sitting in the palace  descried this  he said to his suite   go and see what yon cloud bringeth    replied al mu in   not till we have smitten this fellow s neck   but the sultan said   wait ye till we see what this meaneth    now the dust cloud was the dust of j afar the barmecide  wazir to the caliph  and his host  and the cause of his coming was as follows   the caliph passed thirty days without calling to mind the matter of nur al din ali  fn 75  and none reminded him of it  till one night  as he passed by the chamber of anis al jalis  he heard her weeping and singing with a soft sweet voice these lines of the poet    in thought i see thy form when farthest far or nearest near         and on my tongue there dwells a name which man shall ne er      unhear    then her weeping redoubled  when lo  the caliph opened the door and  entering the chamber  found anis al jalis in tears   when she saw him she fell to the ground and kissing his feet three times repeated these lines    o fertile root and noble growth of trunk    ripe fruitful branch      of never sullied race  i mind thee of what pact thy bounty made    far be  t from thee      thou should st forget my case    quoth the caliph   who art thou   and she replied   i am she whom ali bin khakan gave thee in gift  and i wish the fulfilment of thy promise to send me to him with the robe of honour  for i have now been thirty days without tasting the food of sleep    thereupon the caliph sent for ja afar and said to him   o ja afar   tis thirty days since we have had news of nur al din bin khakan  and i cannot suppose that the sultan hath slain him  but  by the life of my head and by the sepulchres of my forefathers  if aught of foul play hath befallen him  i will surely make an end of him who was the cause of it  though he be the dearest of all men to myself  so i desire that thou set out for bassorah within this hour and bring me tidings of my cousin  king mohammed bin sulayman al zayni  and how he had dealt with nur al din ali bin khakan   adding   if thou tarry longer on the road than shall suffice for the journey  i will strike off they head  furthermore  do thou tell the son of my uncle the whole story of nur al din  and how i sent him with my written orders  and if thou find  o my cousin  fn 76  that the king hath done otherwise than as i commanded  bring him and the wazir al mu in bin sawi to us in whatsoever guise thou shalt find them   fn 77    hearing and obedience   replied ja afar and  making ready on the instant  he set out for bassorah where the news of his coming had foregone him and had reached to the ears of king mohammed  when ja afar arrived and saw the crushing and crowding of the lieges  he asked   what means all this gathering   so they told him what was doing in the matter of nur al din  whereupon he hastened to go to the sultan and saluting him  acquainted him with the cause why he came and the caliph s resolve  in case of any foul play having befallen the youth  to put to death whoso should have brought it about   then he took into custody the king and the wazir and laid them in ward and  giving order for the release of nur al din ali  enthroned him as sultan in the stead of mohammed bin sulayman   after this ja afar abode three days in bassorah  the usual guest time  and on the morning of the fourth day  nur al din ali turned to him and said   i long for the sight of the commander of the faithful   then said ja afar to mohammed bin sulayman   make ready to travel  for we will say the dawn prayer and mount baghdad wards   and he replied   to hear is to obey    then they prayed and they took horse and set out  all of them  carrying with them the wazir  al mu in bin sawi  who began to repent him of what he had done   nur al din rode by ja afar s side and they stinted not faring on till they arrived at baghdad  the house of peace  and going in to the caliph told him how they had found nur al din nigh upon death   thereupon the caliph said to the youth   take this sword and smite with it the neck of thine enemy    so he took the sword from his hand and stepped up to al mu in who looked at him and said   i did according to my mother s milk  do thou according to thine   fn 78  upon this nur al din cast the sword from his hand and said to the caliph   o commander of the faithful  he hath beguiled me with his words   and he repeated this couplet    by craft and sleight i snared him when he came    a few fair      words aye trap the noble game     leave him then   cried the caliph and  turning to masrur said   rise thou and smite his neck    so masrur drew his sword and struck off his head  then quoth the caliph to nur al din ali   ask a boon of me     o my lord   answered he   i have no need of the kingship of bassorah  my sole desire is to be honoured by serving thee and by seeing the countenance    with love and gladness   said the caliph   then he sent for the damsel  anis al jalis  and bestowed plentiful favours upon them both and gave them one of his palaces in baghdad  and assigned stipends and allowances  and made nur al din ali bin fazl bin khakan  one of his cup companions  and he abode with the commander of the faithful enjoying the pleasantest of lives till death overtook him    yet  continued shahrazad  is not his story in any wise more wondrous than the history of the merchant and his children    the king asked  and what was that   and shahrazad began to relate the     tale of ghanim bin ayyub fn 79   the distraught  the thrall o  love    it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that in times of yore and in years and ages long gone before  there lived in damascus a merchant among the merchants  a wealthy man who had a son like the moon on the night of his fulness fn 80  and withal sweet of speech  who was named ghanim bin  ayyub  surnamed the distraught  the thrall o  love  he had also a daughter  own sister to ghanim  who was called fitnah  a damsel unique in beauty and loveliness  their father died and left them abundant wealth   and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say                 when it was the thirty ninth night   she said  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that the merchant left his two children abundant wealth and amongst other things an hundred loads fn 81  of silks and brocades  musk pods and mother o  pearl  and there was written on every bale   this is of the packages intended for baghdad   it having been his purpose to make the journey thither  when almighty allah took him to himself  which was in the time of the caliph harun al rashid  after a while his son took the loads and  bidding farewell to his mother and kindred and townsfolk  went forth with a company of merchants  putting his trust in allah almighty  who decreed him safety  so that he arrived without let or stay at baghdad  there he hired for himself a fair dwelling house which he furnished with carpets and cushions  curtains and hangings  and therein stored his bales and stabled his mules and camels  after which he abode a while resting  presently the merchants and notables of baghdad came and saluted him  after which he took a bundle containing ten pieces of costly stuffs  with the prices written on them  and carried it to the merchants  bazar  where they welcomed and saluted him and showed him all honour  and  making him dismount from his beast  seated him in the shop of the syndic of the market  to whom he delivered the package  he opened it and  drawing out the pieces of stuff  sold them for him at a profit of two diners on every diner of prime cost  at this ghanim rejoiced and kept selling his silks and stuffs one after another  and ceased not to do on this wise for a full year  on the first day of the following year he went  as was his wont  to the exchange which was in the bazar  but found the gate shut  and enquiring the reason was told   one of the merchants is dead and all the others have gone to follow his bier  fn 82  and why shouldst thou not win the meed of good deeds by walking with them   fn 83  he replied  yes   and asked for the quarter where the funeral was taking place  and one directed him thereto  so he purified himself by the wuzu ablution fn 84  and repaired with the other merchants to the oratory  where they prayed over the dead  then walked before the bier to the burial place  and ghanim  who was a bashful man  followed them being ashamed to leave them  they presently issued from the city  and passed through the tombs until they reached the grave where they found that the deceased s kith and kin had pitched a tent over the tomb and had brought thither lamps and wax candles  so they buried the body and sat down while the readers read out and recited the koran over the grave  and ghanim sat with them  being overcome with bashfulness and saying to himself  i cannot well go away till they do   they tarried listening to the koranic perfection till nightfall  when the servants set supper and sweetmeats fn 85  before them and they ate till they were satisfied  then they washed their hands and again took their places  but ghanim s mind was preoccupied with his house and goods  being in fear of robbers  and he said to himself   i am a stranger here and supposed to have money  if i pass the night abroad the thieves will steal my money bags and my bales to boot   so when he could no longer control his fear he arose and left the assembly  having first asked leave to go about some urgent business  and following the signs of the road he soon came to the city gate  but it was midnight and he found the doors locked and saw none going or coming nor heard aught but the hounds baying and the wolves howling  at this he exclaimed   there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah  i was in fear for my property and came back on its account  but now i find the gate shut and i am in mortal fear for my life   then he turned back and  looking out for a place where he could sleep till morning  presently found a santon s tomb  a square of four walls with a date tree in the central court and a granite gateway  the door was wide open  so he entered and would fain have slept  but sleep came not to him  and terror and a sense of desolation oppressed him for that he was alone amidst the tombs  so he rose to his feet and  opening the door  looked out and lo  he was ware of a light afar off in the direction of the city gate  then walking a little way towards it  he saw that it was on the road whereby he had reached the tomb  this made him fear for his life  so he hastily shut the door and climbed to the top of the dale tree where he hid himself in the heart of the fronds  the light came nearer and nearer till it was close to the tomb  then it stopped and he saw three slaves  two bearing a chest and one with a lanthorn  an adze and a basket containing some mortar  when they reached the tomb  one of those who were carrying the case said   what aileth thee o sawab    and said the other   what is the matter o kafur   fn 86  quoth he   were we not here at supper tide and did we not leave the door open    yes   replied the other   that is true     see   said kafur   now it is shut and barred    how weak are your wits   cried the third who bore the adze and his name was bukhayt  fn 87   know ye not that the owners of the gardens use to come out from baghdad and tend them and  when evening closes upon them  they enter this place and shut the door  for fear lest the wicked blackmen  like ourselves  should catch them and roast  em and eat  em   fn 88   thou sayest sooth   said the two others   but by allah  however that may be  none amongst us is weaker of wits than thou    if ye do not believe me   said bukhayt   let us enter the tomb and i will rouse the rat for you  for i doubt not but that  when he saw the light and us making for the place  he ran up the date tree and hid there for fear of us   when ghanim heard this  he said in himself   o curstest of slaves  may allah not have thee in his holy keeping for this thy craft and keenness of wit  there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah  the glorious  the great  how shall i win free of these blackamoors   then said the two who bore the box to him of the adze   swarm up the wall and open the gate for us  o bukhayt  for we are tired of carrying the chest on our necks  and when thou hast opened the gate thou shalt have one of those we catch inside  a fine fat rat which we will fry for thee after such excellent fashion that not a speck of his fat shall be lost   but bukhayt answered   i am afraid of somewhat which my weak wits have suggested to me  we should do better to throw the chest over the gateway  for it is our treasure    if we throw it  twill break   replied they  and he said   i fear lest there be robbers within who murder folk and plunder their goods  for evening is their time of entering such places and dividing their spoil    o thou weak o  wits   said both the bearers of the box   how could they ever get in here   fn 89  then they set down the chest and climbing over the wall dropped inside and opened the gate  whilst the third slave  he that was called bukhayt  stood by them holding the adze  the lanthorn and the hand basket containing the mortar  after this they locked the gate and sat down  and presently one of them said   o my brethren  we are wearied with walking and with lifting up and setting down the chest  and with unlocking and locking the gate  and now  tis midnight  and we have no breath left to open a tomb and bury the box  so let us rest here two or three hours  then rise and do the job  meanwhile each of us shall tell how he came to be castrated and all that befel him from first to last  the better to pass away our time while we take our rest   thereupon the first  he of the lanthorn and whose name was bukhayt  said   i ll tell you my tale    say on   replied they  so he began as follows the  tale of the first eunuch  bukhayt   know  o my brothers  that when i was a little one  some five years old  i was taken home from my native country by a slave driver who sold me to a certain apparitor  fn 90  my purchaser had a daughter three years old  with whom i was brought up  and they used to make mock of me  letting me play with her and dance for her fn 91  and sing to her  till i reached the age of twelve and she that of ten  and even then they did not forbid me seeing her  one day i went in to her and found her sitting in an inner room  and she looked as if she had just come out of the bath which was in the house  for she was scented with essences and reek of aromatic woods  and her face shone like a circle of the moon on the fourteenth night  she began to sport with me  and i with her  now i had just reached the age of puberty  so my prickle stood at point  as it were a huge key  then she threw me on my back and  mounting astraddle on my breast  fell a wriggling and a bucking upon me till she had uncovered my yard  when she saw it standing with head erect  she hent it in hand and began rubbing it upon the lips of her little slit fn 92  outside her petticoat trousers  thereat hot lust stirred in me and i threw my arms round her  while she wound hers about my neck and hugged me to her with all her might  till  before i knew what i did  my pizzle split up her trousers and entered her slit and did away her maiden head  when i saw this  i ran off and took refuge with one of my comrades  presently her mother came in to her  and  seeing her in this case  fainted clean away  however she managed the matter advisedly and hid it from the girl s father out of good will to me  nor did they cease to call to me and coax me  till they took me from where i was  after two months had passed by  her mother married her to a young man  a barber who used to shave her papa  and portioned and fitted her out of her own monies  whilst the father knew nothing of what had passed  on the night of consummation they cut the throat of a pigeon poult and sprinkled the blood on her shift  fn 93  after a while they seized me unawares and gelded me  and  when they brought her to her bridegroom  they made me her agha  fn 94  her eunuch  to walk before her wheresoever she went  whether to the bath or to her father s house  i abode with her a long time enjoying her beauty and loveliness by way of kissing and clipping and coupling with her  fn 95  till she died  and her husband and mother and father died also  when they seized me for the royal treasury as being the property of an intestate  and i found my way hither  where i became your comrade  this  then  o my brethren  is the cause of my cullions being cut off  and peace be with you  he ceased and his fellow began in these words the  tale of the second eunuch  kafur   know  o my brothers that  when beginning service as a boy of eight  i used to tell the slave dealers regularly and exactly one lie every year  so that they fell out with one another  till at last my master lost patience with me and  carrying me down to the market  ordered the brokers to cry   who will buy this slave  knowing his blemish and making allowance for it   he did so and they asked him   pray  what may be his blemish   and he answered   he telleth me one single lie every year   now a man that was a merchant came up and said to the broker   how much do they allow for him with his blemish    they allow six hundred dirhams   he replied  and said the other   thou shalt have twenty dirhams for thyself   so he arranged between him and the slave dealer who took the coin from him and the broker carried me to the merchant s house and departed  after receiving his brokerage  the trader clothed me with suitable dress  and i stayed in his service the rest of my twelvemonth  until the new year began happily  it was a blessed season  plenteous in the produce of the earth  and the merchants used to feast every day at the house of some one among them  till it was my master s turn to entertain them in a flower garden without the city  so he and the other merchants went to the garden  taking with them all that they required of provaunt and else beside  and sat eating and carousing and drinking till mid day  when my master  having need of some matter from his home  said to me   o slave  mount the she mule and hie thee to the house and bring from thy mistress such and such a thing and return quickly   i obeyed his bidding and started for the house but  as i drew near it  i began to cry out and shed tears  whereupon all the people of the quarter collected  great and small  and my master s wife and daughters  hearing the noise i was making  opened the door and asked me what was the matter  said i   my master was sitting with his friends beneath an old wall  and it fell on one and all of them  and when i saw what had happened to them  i mounted the mule and came hither in haste to tell you   when my master s daughters and wife heard this  they screamed and rent their raiment and beat their faces  whilst the neighbours came around them  then the wife over turned the furniture of the house  one thing upon another  and tore down the shelves and broke the windows and the lattices and smeared the walls with mud and indigo  saying to me   woe to thee  o kafur  come help me to tear down these cupboards and break up these vessels and this china ware  fn 96  and the rest of it   so i went to her and aided her to smash all the shelves in the house with whatever stood upon them  after which i went round about the terrace roofs and every part of the place  spoiling all i could and leaving no china in the house unbroken till i had laid waste the whole  crying out the while  well away  my master   then my mistress fared forth bare faced wearing a head kerchief and naught else  and her daughters and the children sallied out with her  and said to me   o kafur  go thou before us and show us the place where thy master lieth dead  that we may take him from under the fallen wall and lay him on a bier and bear him to the house and give him a fine funeral   so i went forth before them crying out   slack  my master    and they after me with faces and heads bare and all shrieking   alas  alas for the man   now there remained none in the quarter  neither man nor woman  nor epicene  nor youth nor maid  nor child nor old trot  but went with us smiting their faces and weeping bitterly  and i led them leisurely through the whole city  the folk asked them what was the matter  whereupon they told them what they had heard from me  and all exclaimed   there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah   then said one of them   he was a personage of consequence  so let us go to the governor and tell him what hath befallen him   when they told the governor   and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say                when it was the fortieth night  fn 97   she said  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that when they told the governor  he rose and mounted and  taking with him labourers  with spades and baskets  went on my track  with many people behind him  and i ran on before them  howling and casting dust on my head and beating my face  followed by my mistress and her children keening for the dead  but i got ahead of them and entered the garden before them  and when my master saw me in this state  i smiting my face and saying   well away  my mistress  alas  alas  alas  who is left to take pity on me  now that my mistress is gone  would i had been a sacrifice for her    he stood aghast and his colour waxed yellow and he said to me   what aileth thee o kafur  what is the matter    o my lord   i replied   when thou sentest me to the house  i found that the saloon wall had given way and had fallen like a layer upon my mistress and her children    and did not thy mistress escape    no  by allah  o my master  not one of them was saved  the first to die was my mistress  thine elder daughter    and did not my younger daughter escape     no  she did not    and what became of the mare mule i use to ride  is she safe    no  by allah  o my master  the house walls and the stable walls buried every living thing that was within doors  even to the sheep and geese and poultry  so that they all became a heap of flesh and the dogs and cats are eating them and not one of them is left alive    and hath not thy master  my elder son  escaped    no  by allah  not one of them was saved  and now there is naught left of house or household  nor even a sign of them  and  as for the sheep and geese and hens  the cats and dogs have devoured them   when my master heard this the light became night before his sight  his wits were dazed and he so lost command of his senses that he could not stand firm on his feet  he was as one struck with a sudden palsy and his back was like to break  then he rent his raiment and plucked out his beard and  casting his turband from off his head  buffeted his face till the blood ran down and he cried aloud   alas  my children  alas  my wife  alas  my calamity  to whom ever befel that which hath befallen me   the merchants  his friends  also cried aloud at his crying and wept for his weeping and tore their clothes  being moved to pity of his case  and so my master went out of the garden  smiting his face with such violence that from excess of pain he staggered like one drunken with wine  as he and the merchants came forth from the garden gate  behold  they saw a great cloud of dust and heard a loud noise of crying and lamentation  so they looked and lo  it was the governor with his attendants and the townsfolk  a world of people  who had come out to look on  and my master s family following them  all screaming and crying aloud and weeping exceeding sore weeping  the first to address my owner were his wife and children  and when he saw them he was confounded and laughed fn 98  and said to them   how is it with all of you and what befel you in the house and what hath come to pass to you   when they saw him they exclaimed   praise be to allah for thy preservation   and threw themselves upon him and his children hung about him crying   slack  our father  thanks to allah for thy safety  o our father   and his wife said to him   art thou indeed well  laud to allah who hath shown us thy face in safety   and indeed she was confounded and her reason fled when she saw him  and she asked   o  my lord  how didst thou escape  thou and thy friends the merchants    and he answered her   and how fared it with thee in the house   quoth they   we were all well  whole and healthy  nor hath aught of evil befallen us in the house  save that thy slave kafur came to us  bareheaded with torn garments and howling   alas  the master  alas the master   so we asked him   what tidings  o kafur   and he answered  a wall of the garden hath fallen on my master and his friends the merchants  and they are all crushed and dead      by allah   said my master   he came to me but now howling   alas  my mistress  alas  the children of the mistress    and said   my mistress and her children are all dead  every one of them    then he looked round and seeing me with my turband rent in rags round my neck  howling and weeping with exceeding weeping and throwing dust upon my head  he cried out at me  so i came to him and he said   woe to thee  o ill omened slave  o whoreson knave  o thou damned breed  what mischief thou hast wrought  by allah  i will flog thy skin from thy flesh and cut thy flesh from thy bones   i rejoined   by allah  thou canst do nothing of the kind with me  o my lord  for thou boughtest me with my blemish  and there are honest men to bear witness against thee that thou didst so accepting the condition  and that thou knewest of my fault which is to tell one lie every year  now this is only a half lie  but by the end of the year i will tell the other half  then will the lie stand whole and complete    o dog  son of a dog    cried my master   o most accursed of slaves  is this all of it but a half lie  verily if it be a half lie  tis a whole calamity  get thee from me  thou art free in the face of allah    by allah   rejoined i  if thou free me  i will not free thee till my year is completed and i have told thee the half lie which is left  when this is done  go down with me to the slave market and sell me as thou boughtest me to whoso will buy me with my blemish  but thou shalt not manumit me  for i have no handicraft whereby to gain my living  fn 99  and this my demand is a matter of law which the doctors have laid down in the chapter of emancipation   fn 100  while we were at these words  up came the crowd of people  and the neighbours of the quarter  men  women and children  together with the governor and his suite offering condolence  so my master and the other merchants went up to him and informed him of the adventure  and how this was but a half lie  at which all wondered  deeming it a whole lie and a big one  and they cursed me and reviled me  while i stood laughing and grinning at them  till at last i asked   how shall my master slay me when he bought me with this my blemish   then my master returned home and found his house in ruins  and it was i who had laid waste the greater part of it  fn 101  having broken things which were worth much money  as also had done his wife  who said to him    twas kafur who broke the vessels and chinaware   thereupon his rage redoubled and he struck hand upon hand exclaiming   by allah  in my life never saw i a whoreson like this slave  and he saith this is but a half lie  how  then  if he had told me a whole lie  he would ruin a city  aye or even two   then in his fury he went to the governor  and they gave me a neat thing in the bastinado line and made me eat stick till i was lost to the world and a fainting fit came on me  and  whilst i was yet senseless  they brought the barber who docked me and gelded me fn 102  and cauterised the wound  when i revived i found myself a clean eunuch with nothing left  and my master said to me   even as thou hast burned my heart for the things i held dearest  so have i burnt thy heart for that of thy members whereby thou settest most store   then he took me and sold me at a profit  for that i was become an eunuch  and i ceased not bringing trouble upon all  wherever i was sold  and was shifted from lord to lord and from notable to notable  being sold and being bought  till i entered the palace of the commander of the faithful  but now my spirit is broken and my tricks are gone from me  so alas  are my ballocks  when the two slaves heard his history  they laughed at him and chaffed him and said   truly thou art skite fn 103  and skite son  thou liedest an odious lie   then quoth they to the third slave   tell us thy tale    o sons of my uncle   quoth he   all that ye have said is idle  i will tell you the cause of my losing my testicles  and indeed i deserved to lose even more  for i futtered both my mistress and my master s eldest son and heir  but my story is a long one and this is not the time to tell it  for the dawn  o my cousins  draweth near and if morning come upon us with this chest still unburied  we shall get into sore disgrace and our lives will pay for it  so up with you and open the door and  when we get back to the palace  i will tell you my story and the cause of my losing my precious stones   then he swarmed up and dropped down from the wall inside and opened the door  so they entered and  setting down the lantern  dug between four tombs a hole as long as the chest and of the same breadth  kafur plied the spade and sawab removed the earth by baskets full till they reached the depth of the stature of a man  fn 104  when they laid the chest in the hole and threw back the earth over it  then they went forth and shutting the door disappeared from ghanim s eyes  when all was quiet and he felt sure that he was left alone in the place  his thought was busied about what the chest contained and he said to himself   would that i knew the contents of that box   however  he waited till day broke  when morning shone and showed her sheen  whereupon he came down from the date tree and scooped away the earth with his hands  till the box was laid bare and disengaged from the ground  then he took a large stone and hammered at the lock till he broke it and  opening the lid  behold a young lady  a model of beauty and loveliness  clad in the richest of garments and jewels of gold and such necklaces of precious stones that  were the sultan s country evened with them  it would not pay their price  she had been drugged with bhang  but her bosom  rising and falling  showed that her breath had not departed  when ghanim saw her  he knew that some one had played her false and hocussed her  so he pulled her out of the chest and laid her on the ground with her face upwards  as soon as she smelt the breeze and the air entered her nostrils  mouth and lungs  she sneezed and choked and coughed  when there fell from out her throat a pill of cretan bhang  had an elephant smelt it he would have slept from night to night  then she opened her eyes and glancing around said  in sweet voice and gracious words   woe to thee o wind  there is naught in thee to satisfy the thirsty  nor aught to gratify one whose thirst is satisfied  where is zhar al bostan   but no one answered her  so she turned her and cried out   ho sabihah  shajarat al durr  nur al huda  najmat al subh  be ye awake  shahwah  nuzhab  halwa  zarifah  out on you  speak  fn 105    but no one answered  so she looked all around and said   woe s me  have they entombed me in the tombs  o thou who knowest what man s thought enwombs and who givest compensation on the day of doom  who can have brought me from amid hanging screens and curtains veiling the harim rooms and set me down between four tombs   all this while ghanim was standing by  then he said to her   o my lady  here are neither screened rooms nor palace harims nor yet tombs  only the slave henceforth devoted to thy love  ghanim bin ayyub  sent to thee by the omniscient one above  that all thy troubles he may remove and win for thee every wish that cloth behove   then he held his peace  she was reassured by his words and cried   i testify that there is no god but the god and i testify that mohammed is the apostle of god    then she turned to ghanim and  placing her hands before her face  said to him in the sweetest speech   o blessed youth  who brought me hither  see  i am now come to myself    o my lady   he replied   three slave eunuchs came here bearing this chest   and related to her the whole of what had befallen him  and how evening having closed upon him had proved the cause of her preservation  otherwise she had died smothered  fn 106  then he asked her who she was and what was her story  and she answered   o youth  thanks be to allah who hath cast me into the hands of the like of thee  but now rise and put me back into the box  then fare forth upon the road and hire the first camel driver or muleteer thou findest to carry it to thy house  when i am there  all will be well and i will tell thee my tale and acquaint thee with my adventures  and great shall be thy gain by means of me   at this he rejoiced and went outside the tomb  the day was now dazzling bright and the firmament shone with light and the folk had begun to circulate  so he hired a man with a mule and  bringing him to the tomb  lifted the chest wherein he had put the damsel and set it on the mule  her love now engrossed his heart and he fared homeward with her rejoicing  for that she was a girl worth ten thousand gold pieces and her raiment and ornaments would fetch a mint of money  as soon as he arrived at his house he carried in the chest and opening it   and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say                  when it was the forty first night   she said  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that when ghanim son of ayyub arrived with the chest at his house  he opened it and took out the young lady  who looked about her and  seeing that the place was handsome  spread with carpets and dight with cheerful colours and other deckings  and noting the stuffs up piled and packed bales and other else than that  knew that he was a substantial merchant and a man of much money  there upon she uncovered her face and looked at him  and lo  he was a fair youth  so when she saw him she loved him and said   o my lord  bring us something to eat    on my head and mine eyes   replied he  and  going down to the bazar  bought a roasted lamb and a dish of sweetmeats and with these dry fruits and wax candles  besides wine and whatsoever was required of drinking materials  not forgetting perfumes  with all this gear he returned to the house  and when the damsel saw him she laughed and kissed him and clasped his neck  then she began caressing him  which made his love wax hotter till it got the mastery of his heart  they ate and drank and each had conceived the fondest affection  for indeed the two were one in age and one in loveliness  and when night came on ghanim bin ayyub  the distraught  the thrall o  love  rose and lit the wax candles and lamps till the place blazed with light  fn 107  after which he produced the wine service and spread the table  then both sat down again  he and she  and he kept filling and giving her to drink  and she kept filling and giving him to drink  and they played and toyed and laughed and recited verses  whilst their joy increased and they dove in closer love each to each  glory be to the uniter of hearts    they ceased not to carouse after this fashion till near upon dawn when drowsiness overcame them and they slept where they were  apart each from other  till the morning  fn 108  then ghanim arose and going to the market  bought all they required of meat and vegetables and wine and what not  and brought them to the house  whereupon both sat down to eat and ate their sufficiency  when he set on wine  they drank and each played with each  till their cheeks flushed red and their eyes took a darker hue and ghanim s soul longed to kiss the girl and to lie with her and he said   o my lady  grant me one kiss of that dear mouth  per chance  t will quench the fire of my heart    o ghanim   replied she   wait till i am drunk and dead to the world  then steal a kiss of me  secretly and on such wise that i may not know thou hast kissed me   then she rose and taking off her upper dress sat  in a thin shift of fine linen and a silken head kerchief  fn 109  at this passion inflamed ghanim and he said to her   o my lady  wilt thou not vouchsafe me what i asked of thee    by allah   she replied   that may not be thine  for there is written upon my trouser string fn 110  a hard word   thereupon ghanim s heart sank and desire grew on him as its object offered difficulties  and he improvised these verses    i asked the author of mine ills   to heal the wound with one      sweet kiss  no  no  she cried  fn 111  for ever no    but i  soft whispering       urged yes  quoth she  then take it by my leave    when smiles shall pardon      thine amiss  by force  cried i  nay  she replied   with love and gladness eke      i wis  now ask me not what next occurred   seek grace of god and whist      of this  deem what thou wilt of us  for love   by calumnies the sweeter is nor after this care i one jot   whether my foe be known or not    then his affection increased and love fires rose hotter in his heart  while she refused herself to him saying   thou canst not possess me   they ceased not to make love and enjoy their wine and wassail  whilst ghanim was drowned in the sea of love and longing  but she redoubled in coyness and cruelty till the night brought on the darkness and let fall on them the skirts of sleep  thereupon ghanim rose and lit the lamps and wax candles and refreshed the room and removed the table  then he took her feet and kissed them and  finding them like fresh cream  pressed his face fn 112  on them and said to her   o my lady  take pity on one thy love hath ta en and thine eyes hath slain  for indeed i were heart whole but for thy bane   and he wept somewhat   o my lord  and light of my eyes   quoth she   by allah  i love thee in very sooth and i trust to thy truth  but i know that i may not be thine    and what is the obstacle   asked he  when she answered   tonight i will tell thee my tale  that thou mayst accept my excuse   then she threw herself upon him and winding her arms like a necklace about his neck  kissed him and caressed him and promised him her favours  and they ceased not playing and laughing till love get the firmest hold upon both their hearts  and so it continued a whole month  both passing the night on a single carpet bed  but whenever he would enjoy her  she put him off  whilst mutual love increased upon them and each could hardly abstain from other  one night  as he lay by her side  and both were warm with wine ghanim passed his hand over her breasts and stroked them  then he slipped it down to her waist as far as her navel  she awoke and  sitting up  put her hand to her trousers and finding them fast tied  once more fell asleep  presently  he again felt her and sliding his hand down to her trouser string  began pulling at it  whereupon she awoke and sat upright  ghanim also sat up by her side and she asked him   what dost thou want    i want to lie with thee   he answered   and that we may deal openly and frankly with each other   quoth she   i must now declare to thee my case  that thou mayst know my quality  then will my secret be disclosed to thee and my excuse become manifest to thee   quoth he   so be it   thereat she opened the skirt of her shift and taking up her trouser string  said to him   o my lord  read what is worked on the flat of this string   so he took it in hand  and saw these words broidered on it in gold   i am thine  and thou art mine  o cousin of the apostle    fn 113  when he read this  he withdrew his hand and said to her   tell me who thou art    so be it   answered she   know that i am one of the concubines of the commander of the faithful  and my name is kut al kulub the food of hearts  i was brought up in his palace and  when i grew to woman s estate  he looked on me and  noting what share of beauty and loveliness the creator had given me  loved me with exceeding love  and assigned me a separate apartment  and gave me ten slave girls to wait on me and all these ornaments thou seest me wearing  on a certain day he set out for one of his provinces  and the lady zubaydah came to one of the slave girls in my service and said to her   i have something to require of thee    what is it  o my lady   asked she and the caliph s wife answered   when thy mistress kut al kulub is asleep  put this piece of bhang into her nostrils or drop it into her drink  and thou shalt have of me as much money as will satisfy thee    with love and gladness   replied the girl and took the bhang from her  being a glad woman because of the money and because aforetime she had been one of zubaydah s slaves  so she put the bhang in my drink  and when it was night drank  and the drug had no sooner settled in my stomach than i fell to the ground  my head touching my feet  and knew naught of my life but that i was in another world  when her device succeeded  she bade put me in this chest  and secretly brought in the slaves and the doorkeepers and bribed them  and  on the night when thou wast perched upon the date tree  she sent the blacks to do with me as thou sawest  so my delivery was at thy hands  and thou broughtest me to this house and hast entreated me honourably and with thy kindest  this is my story  and i wot not what is become of the caliph during my absence  know then my condition and divulge not my case   when ghanim heard her words and knew that she was a concubine of the caliph  he drew back  for awe of the caliphate beset him  and sat apart from her in one of the corners of the place  blaming himself and brooding over his affair and patiencing his heart bewildered for love of one he could not possess  then he wept for excess of longing  and plained him of fortune and her injuries  and the world and its enmities  and praise be to him who causeth generous hearts to be troubled with love and the beloved  and who endoweth not the minds of the mean and miserly with so much of it as eveneth a grain weight    so he began repeating    the lover s heart for his beloved must meet   sad pain  and from      her charms bear sore defeat  what is love s taste  they asked and answered i    sweet is the      taste but ah   tis bitter sweet    thereupon kut al kulub arose and took him to her bosom and kissed him  for the love of him was firm fixed in her heart  so that she disclosed to him her secret and all the affection she felt  and  throwing her arms round ghanim s neck like a collar of pearls  kissed him again and yet again  but he held off from her in awe of the caliph  then they talked together a long while  and indeed both were drowned in the sea of their mutual love   and  as the day broke  ghanim rose and donned his clothes and going to the bazar  as was his wont  took what the occasion required and returned home  he found her weeping  but when she saw him she checked herself and  smiling through her tears  said   thou hast desolated me  o beloved of my heart  by allah  this hour of absence hath been to me like a year  fn 114  i have explained to thee my condition in the excess of my eager love for thee  so come now near me  and forget the past and have thy will of me   but he interrupted her crying   i seek refuge with allah  this thing may never be  how shall the dog sit in the lion s stead  what is the lord s is unlawful to the slave   so he with drew from her  and sat down on a corner of the mat  her passion for him increased with his forbearance  so she seated herself by his side and caroused and played with him  till the two were flushed with wine  and she was mad for her own dishonour  then she sang these verses    the lover s heart is like to break in twain    till when these      coy denials ah  till when  o thou who fliest me sans fault of mine    gazelles are wont at      times prove tame to men  absence  aversion  distance and disdain    how shall young lover      all these ills sustain    thereupon ghanim wept and she wept at his weeping  and they ceased not drinking till nightfall  when he rose and spread two beds  each in its place   for whom is this second bed   asked she  and he answered her   one is for me and the other is for thee  from this night forth we must not sleep save thus  for that which is the lord s is unlawful to the thrall    o my master   cried she   let us have done with this  for all things come to pass by fate and fortune   but he refused  and the fire was lighted in her heart and  as her longing waxed fiercer  she clung to him and cried   by allah  we will not sleep save side by side    allah forefend   he replied and prevailed against her and lay apart till the morning  when love and longing redoubled on her and distraction and eager thirst of passion  they abode after this fashion three full told months  which were long and longsome indeed  and every time she made advances to him  he would refuse himself and say   whatever belongeth to the master is unlawful to the man   now when time waxed tiresome and tedious to her and anguish and distress grew on her  she burst out from her oppressed heart with these verses    how long  rare beauty  wilt do wrong to me    who was it bade      thee not belong to me  with outer charms thou weddest inner grace   comprising every      point of piquancy  passion thou hast infused in every heart    from eyelids driven      sleep by deputy  erst was  i wet  the spray made thin of leaf    o cassia spray       unlief thy sin i see  fn 115  the hart erst hunted i  how is  t i spy   the hunter hunted  fair      my hart   by thee  wondrouser still i tell thee aye that i   am trapped while never      up to trap thou be  ne er grant my prayer  for if i grudge thyself   to thee  i      grudge my me more jealously and cry so long as life belong to me    rare beauty how  how long      this wrong to me    they abode in this state a long time  and fear kept ghanim aloof from her  so far concerning these two  but as regards the lady zubaydah  when  in the caliph s absence she had done this deed by kut al kulub she became perplexed  saying to herself   what shall i tell my cousin when he comes back and asks for her  what possible answer can i make to him   then she called an old woman  who was about her and discovered her secret to her saying   how shall i act seeing that kut al kulub died by such untimely death    o my lady   quoth the old crone   the time of the caliph s return is near  so do thou send for a carpenter and bid him make thee a figure of wood in the form of a corpse  we will dig a grave for it midmost the palace and there bury it  then do thou build an oratory over it and set therein lighted candles and lamps  and order each and every in the palace to be clad in black  fn 116  furthermore command thy handmaids and eunuchs as soon as they know of the caliph s returning from his journey  to spread straw over the vestibule floors and  when the commander of the faithful enters and asks what is the matter  let them say    kut al kulub is dead  and may allah abundantly compensate thee for the loss of her  fn 117   and  for the high esteem in which she was held of our mistress  she hath buried her in her own palace  when he hears this he will weep and it shall be grievous to him  then will he cause perfections of the koran to be made for her and he will watch by night at her tomb  should he say to himself   verily zubaydah  the daughter of my uncle  hath compassed in her jealousy the death of kut al kulub   or  if love longing overcome him and he bid her be taken out of her tomb  fear thou not  for when they dig down and come to the image in human shape he will see it shrouded in costly grave clothes  and  if he wish to take off the winding sheet that he may look upon her  do thou forbid him or let some other forbid him  saying   the sight of her nakedness is unlawful   the fear of the world to come will restrain him and he will believe that she is dead and will restore the figure to its place and thank thee for thy doings  and thus thou shalt escape  please almighty allah  from this slough of despond   when the lady zubaydah heard her words  she commended the counsel and gave her a dress of honour and a large sum of money  ordering her to do all she had said  so the old woman set about the business forthright and bade the carpenter make her the afore said image  and  as soon as it was finished  she brought it to the lady zubaydah  who shrouded it and buried it and built a sepulchre over it  wherein they lighted candles and lamps  and laid down carpets about the tomb  moreover she put on black and she spread abroad in the harim that kut al kulub was dead  after a time the caliph returned from his journey and went up to the palace  thinking only of kut al kulub  he saw all the pages and eunuchs and handmaids habited in black  at which his heart fluttered with extreme fear  and  when he went in to the lady zubaydah  he found her also garbed in black  so he asked the cause of this and they gave him tidings of the death of kut al kulub  whereon he fell a swooning  as soon as he came to himself  he asked for her tomb  and the lady zubaydah said to him   know  o prince of the faithful  that for especial honour i have buried her in my own palace   then he repaired in his travelling garb fn 118  to the tomb that he might wail over her  and found the carpets spread and the candles and lamps lighted  when he saw this  he thanked zubaydah for her good deed and abode perplexed  halting between belief and unbelief till at last suspicion overcame him and he gave order to open the grave and take out the body  when he saw the shroud and would have removed it to look upon her  the fear of allah almighty restrained him  and the old woman  taking advantage of the delay  said   restore her to her place   then he sent at once for fakirs and koran readers  and caused perfections to be made over her tomb and sat by the side of the grave  weeping till he fainted  and he continued to frequent the tomb and sit there for a whole month    and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say                 when it was the forty second night   she said  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that the caliph ceased not to frequent the tomb for the period of a whole month  at the end of which time it so happened one day that he entered the serraglio  after dismissing the emirs and wazirs  and lay down and slept awhile  and there sat at his head a slave girl fanning him  and at his feet a second rubbing and shampooing them  presently he awoke and  opening his eyes  shut them again and heard the handmaid at his head saying to her who was at his feet   a nice business this  o khayzaran   and the other answered her  well  o kazib al ban   fn 119   verily  said the first   our lord knoweth naught of what hath happened and sitteth waking and watching by a tomb wherein is only a log of wood carved by the carpenter s art    and kut al kulub   quoth the other   what hath befallen her   she replied   know that the lady zubaydah sent a pellet of bhang by one of the slave women who was bribed to drug her  and when sleep overpowered her she let put her in a chest  and ordered sawab and kafur and bukhayt to throw her amongst the tombs    what dost thou say  o kazib al ban   asked khayzaran   is not the lady kut al kulub dead    nay  by allah   she answered  and long may her youth be saved from death  but i have heard the lady zubaydah say that she is in the house of a young merchant named ghanim bin ayyub of damascus  highs the distraught  the thrall o  love  and she hath been with him these four months  whilst our lord is weeping and watching by night at a tomb wherein is no corpse   they kept on talking this sort of talk  and the caliph gave ear to their words  and  by the time they had ceased speaking  he knew right well that the tomb was a feint and a fraud  and that kut al kulub had been in ghanim s house for four months  whereupon he was angered with exceeding anger and rising up  he summoned the emirs of his state  and his wazir ja afar the barmaki came also and kissed the ground between his hands  the caliph said to him in fury   go down  o ja afar  with a party of armed men and ask for the house of ghanim son of ayyub  fall upon it and spoil it and bring him to me with my slave girl  kut al kulub  for there is no help but that i punish him    to hear is to obey   said ja afar  and setting out with the governor and the guards and a world of people  repaired to ghanim s house  now about that time the youth happened to have brought back a pot of dressed meat and was about to put forth his hand to eat of it  he and kut al kulub  when the lady  happening to look out saw calamity surrounding the house on every side  for the wazir and the governor  the night guard and the mamelukes with swords drawn had girt it as the white of the eye girdeth the black  at this she knew that tidings of her had reached the caliph  her lord  and she made sure of ruin  and her colour paled and her fair features changed and her favour faded  then she turned to ghanim and said to him   o my love  fly for thy life    what shall i do   asked he   and whither shall i go  seeing that my money and means of maintenance are all in this house    and she answered   delay not lest thou be slain and lose life as well as wealth    o my loved one and light of mine eyes   he cried   how shall i do to get away when they have surrounded the house   quoth she   fear not   and  stripping off his fine clothes  dressed him in ragged old garments  after which she took the pot and  putting in it bits of broken bread and a saucer of meat  fn 120  placed the whole in a basket and setting it upon his head said   go out in this guise and fear not for me who wotteth right well what thing is in my hand for the caliph   fn 121  so he went out amongst them  bearing the basket with its contents  and the protector vouchsafed him his protection and he escaped the snares and perils that beset him  by the blessing of his good conscience and pure conduct  meanwhile ja afar dismounted and entering the house  saw kut al kulub who had dressed and decked herself in splendid raiments and ornaments and filled a chest with gold and jewellery and precious stones and rarities and what else was light to bear and of value rare  when she saw ja afar come in  she rose and  kissing the ground before him  said   o my lord  the reed hath written of old the rede which allah decreed    fn 122   by allah  o my lady   answered ja afar   he gave me an order to seize ghanim son of ayyub   and she rejoined   o my lord  he made ready his goods and set out therewith for damascus and i know nothing more of him  but i desire thee take charge of this chest and deliver it to me in the harim of the prince of the faithful    hearing and obedience   said ja afar  and bade his men bear it away to the head quarters of the caliphate together with kut al kulub  commanding them to entreat her with honour as one in high esteem  they did his bidding after they had wrecked and plundered ghanim s house  then ja afar went in to the caliph and told him all that had happened  and he ordered kut al kulub to be lodged in a dark chamber and appointed an old women to serve her  feeling convinced that ghanim had debauched her and slept with her  then he wrote a mandate to the emir mohammed bin sulayman al zayni  his viceroy in damascus  to this effect   the instant thou shalt receive this our letter  seize upon ghanim bin ayyub and send him to us   when the missive came to the viceroy  he kissed it and laid it on his head  then he let proclaim in the bazars   whoso is desirous to plunder  away with him to the house of ghanim son of ayyub   fn 123  so they flocked thither  when they found that ghanim s mother and sister had built him a tomb fn 124  in the midst of the house and sat by it weeping for him  whereupon they seized the two without telling them the cause and  after spoiling the house  carried them before the viceroy  he questioned them concerning ghanim and both replied   for a year or more we have had no news of him   so they restored them to their place  thus far concerning them  but as regards ghanim  when he saw his wealth spoiled and his ruin utterest he wept over himself till his heart well nigh brake  then he fared on at random till the last of the day  and hunger grew hard on him and walking wearied him  so coming to a village he entered a mosque fn 125  where he sat down upon a mat and propped his back against the wall  but presently he sank to the ground in his extremity of famine and fatigue  there he lay till dawn  his heart fluttering for want of food  and  owing to his sweating  the lice fn 126  coursed over his skin  his breath waxed fetid and his whole condition was changed  when the villagers came to pray the dawn prayer  they found him prostrate  ailing  hunger lean  yet showing evident signs of former affluence  as soon as prayers were over  they drew near him  and  understanding that he was starved with hunger and cold  they gave him an old robe with ragged sleeves and said to him   o stranger  whence art thou and what sickness is upon thee   he opened his eyes and wept but returned no answer  whereupon one of them  who saw that he was starving  brought him a saucer of honey and two barley scones  he ate a little and they sat with him till sun rise  when they went to their work  he abode with them in this state for a month  whilst sickness and weakliness grew upon him  and they wept for him and  pitying his condition  took counsel with one another upon his case and agreed to forward him to the hospital in baghdad  fn 127  meanwhile behold  two beggar women  who were none other than ghanim s mother and sister  fn 128  came into the mosque and  when he saw them  he gave them the bread that was at his head  and they slept by his side that night but he knew them not  next day the villagers brought a camel and said to the cameleer   set this sick man on thy beast and carry him to baghdad and put him down at the spital door  so haply he may be medicined and be healed and thou shalt have thy hire   fn 129   to hear is to comply   said the man  so they brought ghanim  who was asleep  out of the mosque and set him  mat and all  on the camel  and his mother and sister came out among the crowd to gaze upon him  but they knew him not  however  after looking at him and considering him carefully they said   of a truth he favours our ghanim  poor boy   can this sick man be he   presently  he woke and finding himself bound with ropes on a camel s back  he began to weep and complain  fn 130  and the village people saw his mother and sister weeping over him  albeit they knew him not  then they fared forth for baghdad  but the camel man forewent them and  setting ghanim down at the spital gate  went away with his beast  the sick man lay there till dawn and  when the folk began to go about the streets  they saw him and stood gazing on him  for he had become as thin as a toothpick  till the syndic of the bazar came up and drove them away from him  saying   i will gain paradise through this poor creature  for if they take him into the hospital  they will kill him in a single day   fn 131  then he made his young men carry him to his house  where they spread him a new bed with a new pillow  fn 132  and he said to his wife   tend him carefully   and she replied   good  on my head be it   thereupon she tucked up her sleeves and warming some water  washed his hands  feet and body  after which she clothed him in a robe belonging to one of her slave girls and made him drink a cup of wine and sprinkled rose wafer over him  so he revived and complained  and the thought of his beloved kut al kulub made his grief redouble  thus far concerning him  but as regards kut al kulub  when the caliph was angered against her    and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say                  when it was the forty third night   she said  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that when the caliph was angered against kut al kulub  he ordered her to a dark chamber where she abode eighty days  at the end of which the caliph  happening to pass on a certain day the place where she was  heard her repeating poetry  and after she ceased reciting her verse  saying   o my darling  o my ghanim  how great is thy goodness and how chaste is thy nature  thou didst well by one who did ill by thee and thou guardedst his honour who garred thine become dishonour  and his harim thou didst protect who to enslave thee and shine did elect  but thou shalt surely stand  thou and the commander of the faithful  before the just judge  and thou shalt be justified of him on the day when the lord  to whom be honour and glory   shall be kazi and the angels of heaven shall be witnesses   when the caliph heard her com plaint  he knew that she had been wronged and  returning to the palace  sent masrur the eunuch for her  she came before him with bowed head and eyes tearful and heart sorrowful  and he said to her   o kut al kulub  i find thou accuses me of tyranny and oppression  and thou avouches that i have done ill by one who did well by me  who is this who hath guarded my honour while i garred his become dishonour  who protected my harim and whose harim i wrecked    he is ghanim son of ayyub   replied she   for he never approached me in wantonness or with lewd intent  i swear by thy munificence  o commander of the faithful   then said the caliph   there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah  ask what thou wilt of me  o kut al kulub    o prince of the faithful    answered she   i require of thee only my beloved ghanim son of ayyub   he did as she desired  whereupon she said   o lord of the moslems  if i bring him to thy presence  wilt thou bestow me on him    and he replied   if he come into my presence  i will give thee to him as the gift of the generous who revoketh not his largesse    o prince of true believers   quoth she   suffer me to go and seek him  haply allah may unite me with him   and quoth he   do even as thou wilt   so she rejoiced and  taking with her a thousand diners in gold  went out and visited the elders of the various faiths and gave alms in ghanim s name  fn 133  next day she walked to the merchants  bazar and disclosed her object to the syndic and gave him money  saying   bestow this in charity to the stranger   on the following friday she fared to the bazar  with other thousand diners  and  entering the goldsmiths  and jewellers  market street  called the chief and presented to him a thousand diners with these words   bestow this in charity to the stranger   the chief looked at her  and he was the syndic who had taken in ghanim  and said   o my lady  wilt thou come to my house and look upon a youth  a stranger i have there and see how goodly and graceful he is   now the stranger was ghanim  son of ayyub  but the chief had no knowledge of him and thought him to be some wandering pauper  some debtor whose wealth had been taken from him  or some lover parted from his beloved  when she heard his words her heart fluttered fn 134  and her vitals yearned  and she said to him   send with me one who shall guide me to thy house   so he sent a little lad who brought her to the house wherein was the head man s stranger guest and she thanked him for this  when she reached the house  she went in and saluted the syndic s wife  who rose and kissed the ground between her hands  for she knew her  then quoth kut al kulub   where is the sick man who is with thee   she wept and replied   here is he  o my lady  by allah  he is come of good folk and he beareth the signs of gentle breeding  you see him lying on yonder bed   so she turned and looked at him  and she saw something like him  but he was worn and wasted till he had become lean as a toothpick  so his identity was doubtful to her and she could not be certain that it was he  yet pity for him possessed her and she wept saying   verily the stranger is unhappy  even though he be a prince in his own land    and his case was grievous to her and her heart ached for him  yet she knew him not to be ghanim  then she furnished him with wine and medicines and she sat awhile by his head  after which she mounted and returned to her palace and continued to visit every bazar in quest of her lover  meanwhile ghanim s mother and sister fitnah arrived at baghdad and met the syndic  who carried them to kut al kulub and said to her   o princess of beneficent ladies  there came to our city this day a woman and her daughter  who are fair of favour and signs of good breeding and dignity are apparent in them  though they be dressed in hair cloth and have each one a wallet hanging to her neck  and their eyes are tearful and their hearts are sorrowful  so i have brought them to thee that thou mayst give them refuge  and rescue them from beggary  for they are not of asker folk and  if it please allah  we shall enter paradise through them    by allah  o my master   cried she   thou makest me long to see them  where are they    adding   here with them to me   so he bade the eunuch bring them in  and  when she looked on them and saw that they were both of distinguished beauty  she wept for them and said   by allah  these are people of condition and show plain signs of former opulence    o my lady   said the syndic s wife   we love the poor and the destitute  more especially as reward in heaven will recompense our love  and  as for these persons  haply the oppressor hath dealt hardly with them and hath plundered their property and harried their houses   then ghanim s mother and sister wept with sore weeping  remembering their former prosperity and contrasting it with their present poverty and miserable condition  and their thoughts dwelt upon son and brother  whilst kut al kulub wept for their weeping  and they said   we beseech allah to reunite us with him whom we desire  and he is none other but my son named ghanim bin ayyud   when kut al kulub heard this  she knew them to be the mother and sister of her lover and wept till a swoon came over her  when she revived she turned to them and said   have no fear and sorrow not  for this day is the first of your prosperity and the last of your adversity    and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say                 when it was the forty fourth night   she said  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that when kut al kulub had consoled them she bade the syndic lead them to his house and let his wife carry them to the hammam and dress them in handsome clothes and take care of them and honour them with all honour  and she gave him a sufficient sum of money  next day  she mounted and  riding to his house  went in to his wife who rose up and kissed her hands and thanked her for her kindness  there she saw ghanim s mother and sister whom the syndic s wife had taken to the hammam and clothed afresh  so that the traces of their former condition became manifest upon them  she sat talking with them awhile  after which she asked the wife about the sick youth who was in her house and she replied   he is in the same state   then said kut al kulub   come  let us go and visit him   so she arose  she and the chief s wife and ghanim s mother and sister  and went in to the room where he lay and sat down near him  presently ghanim bin ayyub  the distraught  the thrall o  love  heard them mention the name of kut al kulub  whereupon life returned to him  emaciated and withered as he was and he raised his head from the pillow and cried aloud   o kut al kulub   she looked at him and made certain it was he and shrieked rather than said   yes  o my beloved    draw near to me   said he  and she replied   surely thou art ghanim bin ayyub    and he rejoined  i am indeed   hereupon a swoon came upon her  and  as soon as ghanim s mother and his sister fitnah heard these words  both cried out  o our joy   and fainted clean away  when they all recovered  kut al kulub exclaimed  praise be to allah who hath brought us together again and who hath reunited thee with thy mother and thy sister   and she related to him all that had befallen her with the caliph and said  i have made known the truth to the commander of the faithful  who believed my words and was pleased with thee  and now he desireth to see thee   adding   he hath given me to thee   thereat he rejoiced with extreme joy  when she said   quit not this place till i come back  and  rising forthwith  betook herself to her palace  there she opened the chest which she had brought from ghanim s house and  taking out some of the diners  gave them to the syndic saying   buy with this money for each of them four complete suits of the finest stuffs and twenty kerchiefs  and else beside of whatsoever they require   after which she carried all three to the baths and had them washed and bathed and made ready for them consommes  and galangale water and cider against their coming out  when they left the hammam  they put on the new clothes  and she abode with them three days feeding them with chicken meats and bouillis  and making them drink sherbert of sugar candy  after three days their spirits returned  and she carried them again to the baths  and when they came out and had changed their raiment  she led them back to the syndic s house and left them there  whilst she returned to the palace and craved permission to see the caliph  when he ordered her to come in  she entered and  kissing the ground between his hands  told him the whole story and how her lord  ghanim bin ayyub  yclept the distraught  the thrall o  love  and his mother and sister were now in baghdad  when the caliph heard this  he turned to the eunuchs and said   here with ghanim to me   so ja afar went to fetch him  but kut al kulub forewent him and told ghanim   the caliph hath sent to fetch thee before him   and charged him to show readiness of tongue and firmness of heart and sweetness of speech  then she robed him in a sumptuous dress and gave him diners in plenty  saying   be lavish of largesse to the caliph s household as thou goest in to him   presently ja afar  mounted on his nubian mule  came to fetch him  and ghanim advanced to welcome the wazir and  wishing him long life  kissed the ground before him  now the star of his good fortune had risen and shone brightly  and ja afar took him  and they ceased not faring together  he and the minister  till they went in to the commander of the faithful  when he stood in the presence  he looked at the wazirs and emirs and chamberlains  and viceroys and grandees and captains  and then at the caliph  hereupon he sweetened his speech and his eloquence and  bowing his head to the ground  broke out in these extempore couplets    may that monarch s life span a mighty span    whose lavish of      largesse all empyrean  lieges scan  none other but he shall be kaysar highs    lord of lordly hall      and of haught divan  kings lay their gems on his threshold dust   as they bow and      salam to the mighty man  and his glances foil them and all recoil    bowing beards aground      and with faces wan  yet they gain the profit of royal grace    the rank and station      of high earth s plain is scant for thy world of men    camp there in kay      wan s fn 135  empyrean  may the king of kings ever hold thee dear    be counsel shine and      right steadfast plan till thy justice spread o er the wide spread earth   and the near      and the far be of equal worth    when he ended his improvisation the caliph was pleased by it and marvelled at the eloquence of his tongue and the sweetness of his speech   and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say                  when it was the forty fifth night   she said  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that the caliph  after marvelling at his eloquence of tongue and sweetness of speech  said to him   draw near to me   so he drew near and quoth the king   tell me thy tale and declare to me thy case   so ghanim sat down and related to him what had befallen him in baghdad  of his sleeping in the tomb and of his opening the chest after the three slaves had departed  and informed him  in short  of everything that had happened to him from commencement to conclusion none of which we will repeat for interest fails in twice told tales  the caliph was convinced that he was a true man  so he invested him with a dress of honour  and placed him near himself in token of favour  and said to him   acquit me of the responsibility i have incurred    fn 136  and ghanim so did  saying   o our lord the sultan  of a truth thy slave and all things his two hands own are his master s   the caliph was pleased at this and gave orders to set apart a palace for him and assigned to him pay and allowances  rations and donations  which amounted to something immense  so he removed thither with sister and mother  after which the caliph  hearing that his sister fitnah was in beauty a very  fitnah   fn 137  a mere seduction  demanded her in marriage of ghanim who replied   she is thy handmaid as i am thy slave   the caliph thanked him and gave him an hundred thousand diners  then summoned the witnesses and the kazi  and on one and the same day they wrote out the two contracts of marriage between the caliph and fitnah and between ghanim bin ayyub and kut al kulub  and the two marriages were consummated on one and the same night  when it was morning  the caliph gave orders to record the history of what had befallen ghanim from first to last and to deposit it in the royal muniment rooms  that those who came after him might read it and marvel at the dealings of destiny and put their trust in him who created the night and the day  yet  o auspicious king  this story to which thou hast deigned give ear is on no wise more wondrous than the          tale of king omar bin al nu uman and his sons sharrkan                        and zau al makan     and what befel them of things seld seen and peregrine  fn 138     the king asked her   and what was their story   and she answered  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that there was in the city of safety  baghdad  before the caliphate of abd al malik bin marwan  fn 139  a king  omar bin al nu uman highs  who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the chosroes of persia and the kaysars of eastern rome  for none could warm himself at his fire  fn 140  nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray  and  when he was angered  there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame   he had made himself king over all quarters  and allah had subjected to him all his creatures  his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands   east and west had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them  hind and sind and sin  fn 141  the holy land  al hijaz  the rich mountains of al yaman and the archipelagos of india and china   moreover  he reigned supreme over the north country and diyar bakr  or mesopotamia  and over sudan  the eastern negro land and the islands of the ocean  and all the far famed rivers of the earth  sayhun and jayhun  fn 142  nile and euphrates   he sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote  to provide him with true report  and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace  with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for king omar bin al nu uman  for he was  o ruler of the age  a right noble king  and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing   this mighty monarch had a son yclept sharrkan  fn 143  who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban   for this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater  and made him heir to the kingdom after himself   this prince grew up till he reached man s estate and was twenty years old  and allah subjected his servants to him  by reason of his great might and prowess in battle   now his father  king omar  had four wives legally married  but allah had vouchsafed him no son by them  save sharrkan  whom he had begotten upon one of them  and the rest were barren   moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines  after the number of days in the coptic year  who were of all nations  and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace   for he had built twelve pavilions  after the number of the months  each containing thirty private chambers  which thus numbered three hundred and three score  wherein he lodged his handmaids  and he appointed according to law for each one her night  when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year  fn 144  and on this wise he abode for a length of time   meanwhile his son sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier  so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities   presently  by decree of the decreer  a handmaid among the handmaids of omar bin nu uman became pregnant  and  her pregnancy being announced to the harim  the king was informed thereof  whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said   haply it will be a son  and so all my offspring will be males   then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness   but when the tidings came to sharrkan  he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous  and he said   verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty   so quoth he to himself   if this concubine bear a male child i will kill it   but he kept that intention hidden in his heart   such was the case with sharrkan  but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows   she was a roumiyah  a greek girl  by name sofiyah or sophia  fn 145  whom the king of roum and lord of caesarea had sent to king omar as a present  together with great store of gifts and of rarities  she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour  and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating   now she had served the king on the night of his sleeping with her  saying to him   o king   i desire of the god of the heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me  so i may bring him up with the best of rearing  and enable him to reach man s estate perfect in intelligence  good manners and prudent bearing  fn 146   a speech which much pleased the king   during her pregnancy she was instant in prayer  fervently supplicating the lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her  and allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool  fn 147   now the king had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female  and in like way his son sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same   in due time sophia was delivered of a child  which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon   so they announced this to all present in the room  whereupon the king s messenger carried the news to him  and sharrkan s eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy   but  after the two had departed  quoth sophia to the midwives   wait with me awhile  for i feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb   then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her  and allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child   the wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon  with forehead flower white  and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light  whereupon the mother rejoiced  as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company  and sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy  fn 148   the rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot  and the tidings reached omar son of al  nu uman  who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news   then he rose and went to her and kissed her head  after which he looked at the boy  and  bending over him  kissed him  whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music  and the king gave order that the boy should be named zau al makan and his sister nuzhat al zaman  fn 149   they answered  hearing and obedience   and did his bidding  so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them  and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside  beyond the power of tongue to rehearse   moreover the people of baghdad  hearing that allah had blessed their king with issue  decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom  and the emirs and wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished king omar bin al nu uman joy of his son  zau al makan  and of his daughter nuzhat al zaman  wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts  and dealt largesse to all  gentle and simple  who were present   after this fashion he did for four days full told  and he lavished upon sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth  and  every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the new borns   and when four years had gone by  he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions   all this while his son sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father  omar son of al nu uman  having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of nuzhat al zaman  and they hid the intelligence from him  until days and years had sped by  whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights   one day  as king omar was sitting in his palace  his chamberlains came in to him and  kissing the ground before him  said   o king there be come ambassadors from the king of roum  lord of constantinople the great  and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree  if the king commend us to introduce them we will so do  and  if not  there is no disputing his behest   he bade them enter and  when they came in  he turned to them and  courteously receiving them  asked them of their case  and what was the cause of their coming   they kissed the ground before him and said   o king glorious and strong   o lord of the arm that is long   know that he who despatched us to thee is king afridun  fn 150  lord of ionia land fn 151  and of the nazarene armies  the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of constantinople  to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel  the prince of casarea  and the cause of this war is as follows   one of the kings of the arabs in past time  during certain of his conquests  chanced upon a hoard of the time of alexander  fn 152  whence he removed wealth past compute  and  amongst other things  three round jewels  big as ostrich eggs  from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man   upon each were graven characts in ionian characters  and they have many virtues and properties  amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a new born child  no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail  nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail  fn 153  when the arab king laid hands upon them and learned their secrets  he sent to king afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned  and he equipped for the mission two ships  one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas  albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels  for that he was king of the arabs  and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the king of constantinople and they were bound to his port  nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the great king  afridun   the two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city  when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the prince of caesarea  who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships  together with the three jewels  and slew the crews   when our king heard of this  he sent an army against them  but they routed it  then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight   whereupon the king waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth fn 154  against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army  nor would he turn back from them till he had left caesarea  of armenia fn 155  in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her prince held sway   so he sent us to the lord of the age and the time  sultan omar bin al nu uman  king of baghdad and of khorasan  desiring that he aid us with an army  so may honour and glory accrue to him  and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents  and of the king s grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance   then the ambassadors kissed the ground before him   and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say                  when it was the forty sixth night   she said  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that  after the ambassadors and retinue from the constantinopolitan king had kissed the ground before omar and had delivered their embassage  they brought out the presents  which were fifty damsels of the choicest from graecia land  and fifty mamelukes in tunics of brocade  belted with girdles of gold and silver  each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one   the girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money   when the king saw them  he rejoiced in them and accepted them  then he bade the ambassadors be honourably entreated and  summoning his wazirs  took counsel with them of what he should do   herewith rose up among them a wazir  an ancient man  dandan fn 156  highs  who kissed the ground before omar and said   o king  there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious  and set over it thy son sharrkan with us as his lieutenants  and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts  first  because the king of roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted  and  secondly  because while no enemy dareth attack our country  thine army may go forth safely and  should it succour the king of graecia land and defeat his foe  the glory will be thine   moreover  the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially  when the tidings shall reach the islands of the ocean and the kings of mauritania shall hear it  they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money   the king pleased by the wazir s words and approving his rede  gave him a dress of honour and said to him   of the like of thee should kings ask counsel  and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son sharrkan command the main battle   then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down  and he expounded to him the matter  telling him what the ambassadors and the wazir dandan had said  and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign  enjoining him not to gainsay dandan in aught he should do   moreover  he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen  armed cap a pie and inured to onset and stress of war   accordingly  sharrkan arose on the instant  and chose out a myriad of horsemen  after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them  saying   ye have delay of three days   they kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions  and provide provisions for the occasion  whilst sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour  and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others   when the appointed three days were ended  the army drew out to the suburbs of baghdad city  fn 157  and king omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the king seven parcels of money  fn 158  then he turned to danden and commended to his care the army of his son  and the wazir kissed the ground before him and answered   i hear and i obey   and lastly he charged sharrkan that he should consult the wazir on all occasions  which he promised to do   after this  the king returned to his city and sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array   so they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen  besides footmen and camp followers   then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled  whilst sharrkan mounted horse  with the wazir dandan by his side  and the colours fluttering over their heads   so the host fared forth and stinted not faring  with the ambassadors preceding them  till day departed and night drew nigh  when they alighted and encamped for the night   and as soon as allah caused the morn tomorrow  they mounted and tried on  guided by the ambassadors  for a space of twenty days  and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious wady well grown with trees and shrubbery   here sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days  halt  so they dismounted and pitched their tents  spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley  whilst the wazir dandan and the ambassadors of king afridun pitched in the sole of the wady  fn 159   as for sharrkan  he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides  he then slacked the reins of his steed  being minded to explore the wady and to mount guard in his own person  because of his father s charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of graecia land and in the enemy s country   so he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the wazir dandan  and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed  when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him  so that he could no longer urge horse with heel   now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback  so when slumber overpowered him  he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets fn 160  which was dense with growth  but sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground   then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees  and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons  eastern and western   he was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne er yet shamed its sayer   there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah  the glorious  the great   but as he rode on  in fear of wild beasts  behold  the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of paradise  and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men   so king sharrkan alighted and  tying his steed to one of the trees  went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in arabic and saying   now by the crush of the messiah  this is not well of you  but whose utters a word  i will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle fn 161     he kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold  a stream was gushing and flowing  and antelopes at large were frisking and roving  and wild cattle amid the pasture moving  and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues  and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs  even as a poet described it in these couplets    most beautiful is earth in budding bloom    when lucid waters      course through plain and wood  no work but his th  all great  th  all glorious    giver of all      gifts  giver of all good    and as sharrkan considered the place  he saw in it a christian monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon  fn 162  through the midst of the convent passed a stream  the water flowing amongst its gardens  and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard  while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder  high bosomed virgins  as saith of them the poet in these couplets    the mead is bright with what is on t   of merry maidens      debonnair  double its beauty and its grace   those trooping damsels slender      fair  virgins of graceful swimming gait   ready with eye and lip to      ensnare  and like the tendril d vine they loose   the rich profusion of      their hair  shooting their shafts and arrows from   beautiful eyes beyond      compare  overpowering and transpiercing   every froward adversaire    sharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest  with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white  and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright  and temple locks like the scorpion s tail  and she was perfect in essence and attributes  as the poet said of her in these couplets    she beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance    and her      straight slender stature enshamed the lance  she burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red    where all manner of      beauties have habitance  and the locks on her forehead were lowering as night   whence      issues a dawn tide of happiest chance    then sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids   come ye on  that i may wrestle with you and gravel you  ere the moon set and the dawn break   so each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright  and pinioned them with their girdles  and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all   then there turned to her an old woman who was before her  and the beldam said as in wrath   o strumpet  cost thou glory in grounding these girls   behold i am an old woman  yet have i thrown them forty times   so what hast thou to boast of   but if thou have the strength to wrestle with me  stand up that i may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels   the young lady smiled at her words  but she was filled with inward wrath  and she jumped up and asked   o my lady zat al dawahi  fn 163  by the truth of the messiah  wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed  or dost thou jest with me    and she answered   yea    and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say                 when it was the forty seventh night   she said  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that when the young lady asked zat al dawahi   by the truth of the messiah  wilt wrestle with me or dost jest    and she answered   yea  i will wrestle with thee in very deed   sharrkan looking on the while   the damsel cried   rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do   when the old woman heard this  she raged with exceeding rage  and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehog  fn 164  then she sprang to her feet  whilst the damsel stood up to her  and said   now by the truth of the messiah  i will not wrestle with thee unless i be naked  mistress whore   fn 165  so she loosed her petticoat trousers and  putting her hand under her clothes  tore them off her body  then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape  girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head if ritah or a spotted snake   with this she inclined towards the damsel and said   do thou as i have done   all this time  sharrkan was gazing at the twain  and laughing at the beldam s loathly semblance   so the damsel leisurely rose and  taking a sash of yamani stuff  passed it twice round her waist  then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal  smooth and rounded  and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples  as it were a bed of nu uman s anemones  and breasts like double pomegranates   then the old woman leant towards her  and the two laid hold either of each  while sharrkan raised his head heavenwards and prayed allah that the belle might beat the beldam   presently the young woman get beneath the old woman  and  gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand  hoisted her off the ground with both  whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and  in so doing fell on her back arsiversy  with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine  furthermore she let fly two great farts fn 166  one of which blew up the dust from the earth s face and the other steamed up to the gate of heaven   sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground   then he arose and  baring his brand looked right and left  but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back  and said to himself   he lied not who named thee lady of calamities   verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others   so he drew near them to hear what should pass between them   then the young lady went up to the old one and  throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness  helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying   o my lady zat al  dawahi  i intended only to throw thee and not all this  but thou triedst to twist out of my hands  so laud to allah for safety   she returned her no answer  but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight  leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned  with the fair damsel standing amongst them   quoth sharrkan to himself   every luck hath its cause   sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune  for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me   so he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled fn 167  him on  when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath  which he brandished shouting the while his war cry   allah is all mighty fn 168    when the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and  taking firm stand on the bank of the stream  whose breadth was six ells  the normal cubits  made one bound and landed clear on the farther side  fn 169  where she turned and cried out with a loud voice   who art thou  o thou fellow  that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime  and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host   whence camest thou and whither art thou going   speak sooth  for truth will stand thee in good stead  and lie not  for lies come of villein breed doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way  that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies  for thou art now in an open plain and  did we shout but a single shout  would come to our rescue four thousand knights  fn 170  so tell me what thou wantest  and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road  we will do so   when sharrkan heard her words he replied   i am a stranger of the moslems  who fared forth this night single handed  seeking for spoil  nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens  so i shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them   quoth she   i would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it  and  as for the handmaids  by allah  they shall never be thy spoil   have i not told thee that to lie is villein vile   quoth he   the wise man is he who taketh warning by others   thereupon quoth she   by the truth of the messiah  did i not fear that thy death would be on my hands  i would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might  but i take pity upon the stranger   so  if thou seek booty  i require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me  by thy faith  that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand  and we will wrestle  i and thou   if thou throw me  set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty  but if i throw thee  thou shalt become under my command   swear this to me  for i fear thy treachery  indeed it hath become a common saw   where perfidy is innate there trust is a weakly mate   now an thou wilt swear i will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee   answered sharrkan  and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul   truly she knoweth not that i am a champion of champions     swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding  and i will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest   draw near that i wrestle with thee   if thou throw me  i have money where withal to ransom myself  and if i throw thee   twill be booty and booty enough for me   rejoined the damsel   i am content herewith   and sharrkan was astounded at her words and said   and by the truth of the apostle  whom allah bless and keep   i too am content on the other part   then said she   swear to me by him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright  that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling  else mayst thou die without the pale of al  islam   sharrkan replied   by allah   were a kazi to swear me  even though he were a kazi of the kazis  fn 171  he would not impose upon me such an oath as this   then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree  but he was drowned in the sea of thought  saying in himself   praise be to him who fashioned her from dirty water   fn 172  then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling  and said to her   cross the stream to me   but she replied   it is not for me to come over to thee  if thou wilt  pass thou over here to me    i cannot do that   quoth he  and quoth she   o boy  i will come across to thee   so she tucked up her skirts and  leaping  landed on the other side of the stream by his side  whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palms  fn 173  but he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness  for he saw a shape which the hand of power had tanned with the dye leaves of the jann  which had been fostered by the hand of beneficence and fanned by the zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted   then she called out to him   o moslem  come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning   and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd  which illumined the whole place with its whiteness  and sharrkan was dazzled by it   then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge  she doing the like  and caught hold of her  and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms   presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist  when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle  breeding languishment  and he fell a trembling like the persian reed in the roaring gale   so she lifted him up and  throwing him to the ground  sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand  for his soul had lost mastery over his senses   then she asked him   o moslem  the slaying of nazarenes is lawful to you folk  what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself    and he answered   o my lady  thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful  for our prophet mohammed  whom allah bless and preserve   prohibited the slaying of women and children  old men and monks    as it was thus revealed to your prophet   she replied   it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy  so rise   i give thee thy life  for generosity is never lost upon the generous   then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib  even women  and she said to him   be not ashamed  but verily one who entereth the land of roum in quest of booty  and cometh to assist kings against kings  how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib     twas not for lack of strength in me   he answered   nor didst thou throw me by thy force  it was thy loveliness overthrew me  so if thou wilt grant me another bout  it will be of thy courtesy   she laughed and said   i grant thee thy request  but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary  and it were only right i should loose them  for haply this next wrestling bout will be long   then she went to the slave girls and  unbinding them  said to them in the tongue of greece   get ye to some safe place  till i foil this moslem s lust and longing for you   so they went away  whilst sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two   then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers  but when he felt waist touch waist  his strength failed him  and she  waxing ware of this  lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding leven flash  and threw him to the ground   he fell on his back  fn 174  and then she said to him   rise  i give thee thy life a second time   i spared thee in the first count because of thy prophet  for that he made unlawful the slaying of women  and i do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood  but i charge thee  if there be in the moslem army sent by omar bin al nu uman to succour the king of constantinople  a stronger than thou  send him hither and tell him of me  for in wrestling there are shifts and trips  catches and holds  such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip  the hug  the feet catch  the thigh lite  fn 175  the jostle and the leg lock    by allah  o my lady   quoth sharrkan  and indeed he was highly incensed against her    had i been master al safdi  master mohammed kimal or ibn al saddi  fn 176  as they were in their prime  i had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest  for o my mistress  by allah  thou hast not grassed me by thy strength  but by the blandishments of thy back parts  for we men of mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight   but now  an thou wish  thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me  and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three  moreover i have regained my presence of mind   when she heard his words she said to him   hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling  o vanquished one   however come on  an thou wilt  but know that this must be the last round   then she bent forward and challenged him and sharrkan did likewise  setting to it in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw  so the two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength such as she had not observed before and said to him   o moslem  thou art now on thy mettle    yes   he replied   thou knowest that there remaineth to me but this one round  after which each of us will wend a different way   she laughed and he laughed too  fn 177  then she overreached at his thigh and caught firm hold of it unawares  which made him greet the ground and fall full on his back   she laughed at him and said   art thou an eater of bran   thou are like a badawi s bonnet which falleth off with every touch or else the father of winds fn 178  that droppeth before a puff of air   fie upon thee  o thou poor thing   adding   get thee back to the moslem army and send us other than thyself  for thou fairest of thews  and proclaim for us  among the arabs and persians  the turks and daylamites  fn 179  whoso hath might in him  let him come to us   then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the stream and said to sharrkan  laughing   parting with thee is right grievous to me  o my lord  but get thee to thy mates before dawn  lest the knights come upon thee and pick thee up on their lance points   thou hast no strength to defend thee against a woman  so how couldst thou hold thine own amongst men of might and knights   sharrkan was confounded and called to her  as she turned from him making towards the convent    o my lady  wilt thou go away and leave the miserable stranger  the broken hearted slave of love   so she turned to him laughing and said   what is thy want   i will grant thee thy prayer    have i set foot in thy country and tasted the sweetness of thy courtesy   replied he   and shall i return without eating of thy victual and tasting thy hospitality  i who have become one of thy servitors    none baulk kindliness save the base   she rejoined   honour us in allah s name  on my head and eyes be it   mount thy steed and ride along the brink of the stream over against me  for now thou art my guest   at this sharrkan was glad and  hastening back to his horse  mounted and walked him abreast of her  and she kept faring on till they came to a drawbridge fn 180  built of beams of the white poplar  hung by pullies and steel chains and made fast with hooks and padlocks   when sharrkan looked  he saw awaiting her upon the bridge the same ten handmaids whom she had thrown in the wrestling bouts  and  as she came up to them  she said to one in the greek tongue   arise and take the reins of his horse and conduct him across into the convent   so she went up to sharrkan and led him over  much puzzled and perturbed with what he saw  and saying to himself   o would that the wazir dandan were here with me that his eyes might look upon these fairest of favours   then he turned to the young lady and said to her   o marvel of loveliness  now i have two claims upon thee  first the claim of good fellowship  and secondly for that thou hast carried me to thy home and offered me thy hospitality   i am now under thy commandance and thy guidance  so do me one last favour by accompanying me to the lands of al islam  where thou shalt look upon many a lion hearted warrior and thou shalt learn who i am   when she heard this she was angered and said to him   by the truth of the messiah  thou hast proved thyself with me a man of keen wit  but now i see what mischief there is in thy heart  and how thou canst permit thyself a speech which proveth thy traitorous intent   how should i do as thou sayest  when i wot that if i came to that king of yours  omar bin al  nu uman  i should never get free from him   for truly he hath not the like of me or behind his city walls or within his palace halls  lord of baghdad and of khorasan though he be  who hath built for himself twelve pavilions  in number as the months of the year  and in each a concubine after the number of the days  and if i come to him he would not prove shy of me  for your folk believe i am lawful to have and to hold as is said in your writ   or those women whom your right hand shall possess as slaves   fn 181  so how canst thou speak thus to me   as for thy saying   thou shalt look upon the braves of the moslems   by the truth of the messiah  thou sayest that which is not true  for i saw your army when it reached our land  these two days ago  and i did not see that your ordinance was the ordinance of kings  but i beheld only a rabble of tribesmen gathered together   and as to thy words   thou shalt know who i am   i did not do thee kindness because of thy dignity but out of pride in myself  and the like of thee should not talk thus to the like of me  even wert thou sharrkan  omar bin al  nu uman s son  the prowess name in these days    knowest thou sharrkan   asked he  and she answered yes  and i know of his coming with an army numbering ten thousand horsemen  also that he was sent by his sire with this force to gain prevalence for the king of constantinople    o my lady   said sharrkan   i adjure thee by thy religion  tell me the cause of all this  that sooth may appear to me clear of untruth  and with whom the fault lies    now by the virtue of thy faith   she replied   did i not fear lest the news of me be bruited abroad that i am of the daughters of roum  i would adventure myself and sally forth single handed against the ten thousand horsemen and slay their leader  the wazir dandan and vanquish their champion sharrkan  fn 182  nor would aught of shame accrue to me thereby  for i have read books and studied the rules of good breeding in the language of the arabs   but i have no need to vaunt my own prowess to thee  more by token as thou hast proved in thy proper person my skill and strength in wrestling  and thou hast learnt my superiority over other women   nor  indeed  had sharrkan himself been here this night and it were said to him   clear this stream   could he have done it  and i only long and lust that the messiah would throw him into my hands in this very convent  that i might go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes     and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say                 when it was the forty eighth night   she said  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that when the nazarene damsel said to sharrkan  and he listening impatiently enow    verily if sharrkan fell into my hands  i would go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes   pride and passion and knightly jealousy took possession of him and he desired to discover and declare himself and to lay on load  but her loveliness restrained him and he began repeating    an faulty of one fault the beauty prove    her charms a thousand      advocates shall move    so she went up and sharrkan after her  and  when he saw the maiden s back and hinder cheeks that clashed against each other  like rollers in the rolling sea  he extemporised these couplets       for her sins is a pleader that brow    and all hearts its fair      pleading must bow  when i saw it i cried   to night   the moon at its fullest doth      show  tho  balkis  own ifrit fn 183  try a bout    spite his force she      would deal him a throw    the two fared on till they reached a gate over which rose a marble archway   this she opened and ushered sharrkan into a long vestibule  vaulted with ten connected arches  from each of which hung a crystal lamp glistening like a spark of fire   the handmaids met her at the further end bearing wax candles of goodly perfume  and wearing on their heads golden fillets crusted with all manner bezel gems  fn 184  and went on before her  sharrkan still following   till they reached the inner convent   there the moslem saw couches and sofas ranged all around  one opposite the other and all over hung with curtains flowered in gold   the monastery floor was paved with every kind of vari coloured marbles and mosaic work  and in the midst stood a basin that held four and twenty jetting fountains of gold  whence the water ran like molten silver  whilst at the upper end stood a throne spread with silks fit only for kings   then said the damsel   ascend  o my lord  this throne   so he went up to it and sat down and she withdrew to remain absent for some time   sharrkan asked of her from one of the servants who answered him   she hath gone to her dormitory  but we will serve thee even as she ordered   so they set before him viands of rare varieties  and he ate his sufficiency  when they brought him a basin of gold and an ewer of silver  and he washed his hands   then his thoughts reverted to his army  knowing not what had befallen it in his absence and calling to mind also how he had forgotten his father s injunctions  so he was troubled about his case  repenting of what he had done till the dawn broke and the day appeared  when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in sea of sadness and repeated    i am not lost to prudence  but indeed   here i m bewildered       what shall be my rede  would any aid me in mine ails of love    by my own might and      sleight would i be free d  but ah  my heart is lost and passion shent    to none save allah      can i trust my need    when he ended his verse behold  there came up to him a rare show and a fair  more than twenty maidens like crescents encompassing the young lady  who shone in their midst as the full moon among the constellations guarding and girding her   she was clad in brocades befitting kings  her breasts were like twin pomegranates  a woven zone set with all kinds of jewels tightly clasped her waist which expanded below into jutting hips  and her hinder cheeks stood out as a mound of crystal fn 185  supporting a silvern shaft   when sharrkan looked at her his wits went nigh to fly away from him with delight  and he forgot army and wazir as he gazed on her fair head decked and dight with a net work of pearls set off by divers sorts of gems   handmaids on her right and handmaids on her left bore her train  as she paced with dainty graceful gait in all the pride of seemlihead   he sprang to his feet seeing such beauty and loveliness  and cried aloud   beware and beware of that zone rarely fair   and broke out into these couplets    with heavy back parts  high breasts delicate    and lissome form      that sways with swimming gait she deftly hides love longing in her breast    but i may never      hide its ban and bate while hosts of followers her steps precede  fn 186    like pearls      now necklaced and now separate    she gazed upon him for a long time and considered him till she was assured of him  when she came up to him and said   in very sooth the place is honoured and illumined by thee  o sharrkan   how sped thy night  o hero  after we went away and left thee    adding   verily lying is a vile thing and a shameful  especially in great kings  and thou art crown prince sharrkan  son and heir of king omar bin al nu uman  so henceforth make no secret of thy rank and condition  nor let me hear aught from thee but the truth  for leasing bequeatheth hate and despite   and as thou art pierced by the shaft of fate  be resignation thine and abide content to wait   when he heard her words he saw that artifice availed him naught and he acknowledged the truth  saying   i am sharrkan  bin omar bin al nu uman  whom fortune hath afflicted and cast into this place  so whatso thou willest  do it in my case   she hung her head groundwards a long while  then turned to him and said   be of good cheer and let thine eyes be cool and clear  fn 187  for thou art the guest of my hospitality  and bread and salt hath made a tie between me and thee  wherefore thou art in my ward and under my safeguard   have no fear for  by the truth of the messiah  if all on earth sought to do thee hurt they should not come at thee  till life had left my body for thy sake  indeed thou art now under the charge of the messiah and of me   hereat she sat her down by his side and fell to playing with him  till his alarm subsided and he knew that had she desired to slay him  she would have done so during the past night   presently she bespoke in the grecian tongue one of her slave girls  who went away and soon came back bringing a beaker and a tray of food  but sharrkan abstained from eating and said to himself   haply she hath put somewhat in this meat   she knew what was in his thought  so she turned to him and said   by the truth of the messiah  the case is not on such wise  nor is there aught in this meat of what thou suspectest   had my mind been set on slaying thee  i had slain thee ere now   then she walked up to the tray and ate of every dish a mouthful  where upon sharrkan came forward and ate too   she was pleased at this and both ate till they were satisfied   they washed their hands and after that she rose and ordered a handmaid to bring perfumes and herbs of sweet savour  wines of all colours and kinds and a wine service with vessels of gold  silver and crystal   she filled a first goblet and drank it off before offering it to him  even as she had done with the food  then she crowned a second and handed it to him   he drank and she said to him   o moslem  see how thou art here in all solace and delight of life   and she ceased not to drink and ply him with drink  till he took leave of his wits    and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day  and ceased saying her permitted say                  when it was the forty ninth night   she said  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that the damsel ceased not to drink and ply sharrkan with drink till he took leave of his wits  for the wine and the intoxication of love he bore her   presently she said to the slave girl   o marjanah fn 188    bring us some instruments of music    to hear is to obey   said the hand maid and going out  returned in the twinkling of an eye with a damascus lute  fn 189  a persian harp  a tartar pipe  and an egyptian dulcimer   the young lady took the lute and  after tuning each several string  began in gentle undersong to sing  softer than zephyr s wing and sweeter than tasmin fn 190  spring  with heart safe and secure from everything the couplets following    allah assain those eyne   what streams of blood they shed    how      many an arrowy glance those lids of thine have sped  i love all lovers who to lovers show them cure     twere wrong to      rue the love in wrong head born and bred  haply fall hapless eye for thee no sleeping kens    heaven help      the hapless heart by force of thee misled  thou doomest me to death who art my king  and i   ransom with      life the deemster who would doom me dead    thereupon each and every of the maidens rose up and taking an instrument  played and recited couplets in the roumi tongue  then their mistress sang also and seeing sharrkan in ecstasies asked him   o moslem  dost thou understand what i say    and he answered   nay  my ecstasy cometh from the beauty of thy finger sips   she laughed and continued   if i sing to thee in arabic what wouldst thou do    i should no longer   quoth he   be master of my senses   then she took an instrument and  changing the measure  began singing these verses    the smack of parting s myrrh to me    how  then  bear patience       aloe  i m girt by ills in trinity            severance  distance       cruelty  my freedom stole that fairest she      and parting irks me      bitterly    when she ended her verse  she looked at sharrkan and found him lost to existence  and he lay for a while stretched at full length and prone among the maidens  fn 191  then he revived and  remembering the songs  again inclined to mirth and merriment  and the twain returned to their wine and wassail  and continued their playing and toying  their pastime and pleasure till day ceased illuminating and night drooped her wing   then the damsel went off to her dormitory and when sharrkan asked after her they answered   she is gone to her sleeping chamber   whereto he rejoined   under allah s ward and his good guard   as soon as it was morning  a handmaid came to him and said to him   my mistress biddeth thee to her   so he rose and followed her and  as he drew near her lodging  the damsels welcomed him with smitten tabrets and songs of greeting  and led him through a great door of ivory studded with pearls and jewels   thence they passed with him into a tall and spacious hall  at the upper end of which was a wide dais carpeted with all kinds of silks  and round it open lattices commanding a view of trees and streams   about the saloon were figures carved in human form  and fashioned on such wise that the air passed through them and set in motion musical instruments within  so that the beholder would fancy they spoke  fn 192  here sat the young lady  looking at the figures  but when she saw sharrkan  she sprang to her feet and  taking him by the hand  made him sit down by her side  and asked him how he had passed the night   he blessed her and the two sat talking awhile till she asked him   knowest thou aught touching lovers and slaves of love    and he answered  yes   i wot somewhat in verse on that matter    let me hear it   quoth she  so he began quoting    pleasure and health  good cheer  good appetite   to azzah       freest with our name and fame  by allah   would i near her off she flies   at tangent  granting      less the more i claim  i dote on azzah  but when clear i off   my rivals  clears me too      that dearest dame  like wandering wight that chose for shade a cloud   which  ere      siesta done  thin air became    when she heard this she said   verily al kuthayyir fn 193  was conspicuous for sweet speech and chaste  and he was superlative in his praise of azzah when he sang   and she began to recite     did azzah deal behest to sun o  noon    the judge had judged her      beauty s bestest boon  and girls who come to me and carp at her    god make their rosy      cheeks her sandal shoon   and indeed   quoth she    twas said that azzah boasted exceeding beauty and loveliness   then she asked sharrkan saying   o prince  cost thou know aught of jamil s fn 194  verses to buthaynah   if so repeat to us somewhat of them   and he answered   yes  i know them better than any   whereupon he began repeating these couplets    jamil  in holy war go fight   to me they say    what war save      fight for fair ones would i e er essay  to me their every word and work are mere delight    and martyrs      crepe i all they slay in fight and fray  an ask i   o buthaynah   what s this love  i pray    which eats      my heart   quoth she    twill stay for ever and aye   and when i cry   of wits return some small display   for daily      use   quoth she   far  far  tis fled away  thou seekst my death  naught else thy will can satisfy   while i      no goal espy save thee and thee alway      thou hast spoken right well   said she   o king s son  and jamil also spoke excellently well   but what would buthaynah have done with him that he saith in his hemistich    thou seekst my death  naught else thy will can satisfy      o my lady   quoth sharrkan   she willed to do him what thou willest to do with me  and even that will not satisfy thee   she laughed at his opportune reply and they ceased not carousing till day put out her light and night came in darkness dight   then she rose and went to her dormitory and slept  while sharrkan slept in his place till morning dawned   as soon as he awoke  the hand maids came to him with tabrets and other instruments of mirth and merriment  as wont  and  kissing the ground between his hands  said to him   bismillah   in allah s name be so kind as to come fn 195   our mistress biddeth thee to her presence   so he rose and accompanied the slave girls who surrounded him  playing on tabrets and other instruments of music  till they passed from that saloon into another and a yet more spacious hall  decorated with pictured likenesses and figures of birds and beasts  passing all description   sharrkan marvelled at the art and artifice of the place and began reciting    he plucks fruits of her necklace in rivalry    and her breast      pearls that bedded in gold mine lie  pure water on silvern bars is her brow    and her cheeks show      roses with rubies vie  meseems in her eyne that the violet s hue   lies purpling set in      the ithmid s fn 196  dye    when the lady saw sharrkan  she stood up to him in honour and  taking his hand  seated him by her side and asked   o son of king omar bin al nu uman  hast thou any cunning in the game of chess    yes   he answered   but do not thou with me as said the poet    i speak and longing love upties me and unties me    till with      her honey dew of inner lip she plies me  i brought the chess board and my liefest lover plays me   with      white and black  fn 197  but black cum white ne er satisfies      me   twas as if king for castle i were fain to place me   till wilful      loss of game atwixt two queens surprise me  and if i seek to read intent in eyes that eye me   oh man   that      glance askance with hint of wish defies me     then she brought the chessboard and played with him  but sharrkan  instead of looking at her moves  kept gazing at her fair mouth  and putting knight in place of elephant and elephant fn 198  instead of knight   she laughed and said to him   if thy play be after this fashion  thou knowest naught of the game    this is only our first   replied he   judge not by this bout   when she beat him he replaced the pieces in position and played again with her  but she beat him a second time  a third  a fourth and a fifth   so she turned to him and said   thou art beaten in everything   and he replied   o my lady  how should one playing with the like of thee avoid being beaten   then she bade bring food  and they ate and washed their hands  after which the wine was set before them and they drank   presently  she took the dulcimer  for her hand was cunning in smiting it  and she began repeating to an accompaniment these couplets    twixt the close tied and open wide no medium fortune knoweth         now ebb and flow then flow and ebb this wise her likeness      showeth  then drink her wine the syne she s thine and smiling thou dost      find her   anon she ll fall and fare away when all thy good      forth goeth    they ceased not to carouse till nightfall and this day was pleasanter even than the first   when darkness set in  the lady betook her to her dormitory  leaving him alone with the hand maids  so he threw himself on the ground and slept till dawn  when the damsels came to him with tambourines and other instruments according to custom   seeing them he roused him hastily and sat up  and they carried him to their mistress  who came to meet him and  taking him by the hand  seated him by her side   then she asked him how he had passed his night  whereat he prayed that her life be prolonged  and she took the lute and sang to it these verses which she improvised    ne er incline thee to part   which embitters the heart e en the sun when he sets     shall in pallor depart    while they were solacing themselves after this fashion  behold  there arose a great and sudden clamour  and a confused crowd of knights and men rushed in  holding drawn swords that glittered and gleamed in their hands  and cried aloud in the grecian tongue  thou hast fallen into our hands  o sharrkan  so make thee sure of death   when he heard this  he said to himself   by allah  she hath entrapped me and held me in play  till her men should come   these are the knights with whom she threatened me  but  tis i who have thrown myself into this strait   then he turned towards the young lady to reproach her  but saw that she had changed colour and her face was pale  and she sprang to her feet and asked the crowd   who are ye    o most gracious princess and peerless onion pearl   answered the leading knight   dost thou weet who is yon man by thy side    not i   she replied   who may he be   quoth the patrician   this is of towns the highwayman   this is he who rideth in the horseman s van   this is sharrkan  son of king omar bin al nu uman   this is he that forceth fortalice and penetrateth every impregnable place   the news of him reached king hardub  thy father  by report of the ancient dame zat al  dawahi  and thy sire  our sovereign  hath made sure that thou hast rendered good service to the army of the greeks by taking captive this ominous lion   when she heard this  she looked at the knight and asked him   what be thy name   and he answered   i am masurah  son of thy slave mausurah bin kashardah  knight of knights    and how   quoth she   durst thou enter my presence without leave   quoth he   o my lady  when i came to the gate  none forbade me  neither chamberlain nor porter  but all the door keepers rose and forewent us as of wont  although  when others come  they leave them standing at the gate while they ask permission to admit them   but this is not a time for long talking  when the king is expecting our return with this prince  the scorpion sting fn 199  of the islamitic host  that he may kill him and drive back his men whither they came  without the bane of battling with them    these words be ill words   rejoined the princess   and dame zat al dawahi lied  avouching an idle thing and a vain  whereof she weeteth not the truth  for by the virtue of the messiah  this man who is with me is not sharrkan  nor is he a captive  but a stranger who came to us seeking our hospitality  and i made him my guest   so even were we assured that this be sharrkan and were it proved to us that it is he beyond a doubt  i say it would ill befit mine honour that i should deliver into your hands one who hath entered under my protection   so make me not a traitor to my guest and a disgrace among men  but return to the king  my father  and kiss the ground before him  and inform him that the case is contrariwise to the report of the lady zat al dawahi    o abrizah   replied masurah  the knight   i cannot return to the king s majesty without his debtor and enemy   quoth she  and indeed she had waxed very wroth     out on thee   return to him with my answer  and no blame shall befal thee   quoth masurah   i will not return without him   thereupon her colour changed and she exclaimed   exceed not in talk and vain words  for verily this man had not come in to us  were he not assured that he could of himself and single handed make head against an hundred riders  and if i said to him   thou art sharrkan  son of king omar bin al nu uman   he would answer   yes   but  tis not of your competence to let or hinder him  for if you do so  he will not turn back from you till he hath slain all that are in this place   behold  here he is by my side  and i will bring him before you sword and targe in hand    albeit i were safe from thy wrath   answered masurah the knight   i am not safe from that of thy father  and when i see him  i shall sign to the knights to take him captive  and we will carry him to the king bound and in abject sort   when she heard this  she said   the matter shall not pass thus  for  twould be blazoning mere folly   this man is but one and ye are an hundred knights  so if you would attack him come out against him  one after one  that it may appear to the king which is the valiant amongst you    and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say                   when it was the fiftieth night   she said  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that princess abrizah said to the knight   this man is but one  and ye are an hundred  so if ye would attack him  come out against him  one after one  that it may appear to the king which is the valiant   quoth masurah  the knight   by the truth of the messiah  thou sayest sooth  and none but i shall sally out against him first   quoth she   wait till i go to him and acquaint him with the case and hear what answer he will make   if he consent   tis well  but if he refuse  ye shall on no wise come to him  for i and my hand maids and whosoever is in the convent will be his ransom   so she went to sharrkan and told him the news  whereat he smiled and knew that she had not informed any of the emirs  but that tidings of him had been bruited and blazed abroad  till the report reached the king  against her wish and intent   so he again began reproaching himself and said   how came i to adventure and play with my life by coming to the country of the greeks   but hearing the young lady s proposal he said to her   indeed their onset  one after one  would be overburdensome to them   will they not come out against me  ten by ten    that would be villainy   said she   let one have at one   when he heard this  he sprang to his feet and made for them with his sword and battle gear  and masurah  the knight  also sprang up and bore down upon him   sharrkan met him like a lion and delivered a shoulder cut fn 200  which clove him to the middle  and the blade came out gleaming and glittering from his back and bowels   when the lady beheld that swashingblow  sharrkan s might was magnified in her sight and she knew that when she overthrew him in the wrestle it was not by her strength but by her beauty and loveliness   so she turned to the knights and said   take wreak for your chief   thereupon out came the slain man s brother  a fierce and furious knight  and rushed upon sharrkan  who delayed not  but smote him also with the shoulder cut and the sword came out glittering from his vitals   then cried the princess   o ye servants of the messiah  avenge your comrade   so they ceased not charging down upon him  one after one  and sharrkan also ceased not playing upon them with the blade  till he had slain fifty knights  the lady looking on the while   and allah cast a panic into the hearts of the survivors  so that they held back and dared not meet him in the duello  but fell upon him in a body  and he laid on load with heart firmer than a rock  and smote them and trod them down like straw under the threshing sled  fn 201  till he had driven sense and soul out of them   then the princess called aloud to her damsels  saying   who is left in the convent    and they replied   none but the gate keepers   whereupon she went up to sharrkan and took him to her bosom  he doing the same  and they returned to the palace  after he had made an end of the melee   now there remained a few of the knights hiding from him in the cells of the monastery  and when the princess saw this she rose from sharrkan s side and left him for a while  but presently came back clad in closely meshed coat of ring mail and holding in her hand a fine indian scymitar   and she said   now by the truth of the messiah  i will not be a niggard of myself for my guest  nor will i abandon him though for this i abide a reproach and a by word in the land of the greeks   then she took reckoning of the dead and found that he had slain fourscore of the knights  and other twenty had taken to flight  fn 202  when she saw what work he had made with them she said to him   allah bless thee  o sharrkan   the cavaliers may well glory in the like of thee   then he rose and wiping his blade clean of the blood of the slain began reciting these couplets    how oft in the mellay i ve cleft the array    and given their      bravest to lions a prey  ask of me and of them when i proved me prow   o er creation  on      days of the foray and fray  when i left in the onslaught their lions to lie   on the sands of      the low lands fn 203  in fieriest day    when he ended his verse  the princess came up to him with smiles and kissed his hand  then she doffed her hauberk and he said to her   o lady mine  wherefore didst thou don that coat of mail and bare thy brand    to guard thee against these caitiffs   fn 204  she replied   then she summoned the gate keepers and asked them   how came ye to admit the king s knights into my dwelling without leave of me    and they answered   o princess  it is not our custom to ask leave of thee for the king s messengers  and especially for the chief of his knights   quoth she   i think ye were minded only to disgrace me and murder my guest   and bade sharrkan smite their necks   he did so and she cried to the rest of her servants   of a truth  they deserved even more than that   then turning to sharrkan  she said to him   now that there hath become manifest to thee what was concealed  thou shalt be made acquainted with my history   know  then  that i am the daughter of king hardub of roum  my name is abrizah and the ancient dame  yclept zat al dawahi  is my grandmother by the sword side   she it certainly is who told my father of thee  and as surely she will compass a sleight to slay me  more by token as thou hast slain my father s chivalry and it is noised abroad that i have separated myself from the nazarenes and have become no better than i should be with the moslems   wherefore it were wiser that i leave this dwelling while zat al dawahi is on my track  but i require of thee the like kindness and courtesy i have shown thee  for enmity will presently befal between me and my father on thine account   so do not thou neglect to do aught that i shall say to thee  remembering all this betided me not save by reason of thee   hearing her words  sharrkan joyed greatly  his breast broadened and his wits flew from him for delight  and he said   by allah  none shall come at thee  while life is in my bosom   but hast thou patience to bear parting from thy parents and thy people    even so   she answered  and sharrkan swore to her and the two plighted their troth   then said she   now is my heart at ease  but there remaineth one other condition for thee    what is it   asked he and she answered   it is that thou return with thy host to thine own country   quoth he   o lady mine  my father  king omar bin al  nu uman  sent me to wage war upon thy sire  on account of the treasure he plundered from the king of constantinople  and amongst the rest three great jewels  noted givers of good fortune   quoth she   cheer thy heart and clear thine eyes  i will tell thee the whole of the tale and the cause of our feud with the king of constantinople   know that we have a yearly festival  highs the convent feast  whereat kings from all quarters and the noblest women are wont to congregate  thither also come merchants and traders with their wives and families  and the visitors abide there seven days   i was wont to be one of them  but  when there befel enmity between us  my father forbade me to be present at the festival for the space of seven years   one year  it chanced that amongst the daughters of the great who resorted to the patron  as was their custom  came a daughter of the king of constantinople  a beautiful girl called sophia   they tarried at the monastery six days and on the seventh the folk went their ways  fn 205  but sophia said   i will not return to constantinople save by water   so they equipped for her a ship in which she embarked with her suite  and making sail they put out to sea  but as they were voyaging behold  a contrary wind caught them and drove the vessel from her course till  as fate and fortune would have it  she fell in with a nazarene craft from the camphor island fn 206  carrying a crew of five hundred armed franks  who had been cruising about a long time   when they sighted the sails of the ship  wherein sophia and her women were  they gave chase in all haste and in less than an hour they came up with her  then they laid the grappling irons aboard her and captured her   then taking her in tow they made all sail for their own island and were but a little distant from it when the wind veered round and  splitting their sails  drove them on to a shoal which lies off our coast   thereupon we sallied forth and  looking on them as spoil driven to us by fate  fn 207  boarded and took them  and  slaying the men  made prize of the wreck  wherein we found the treasures and rarities in question and forty maidens  amongst whom was the king s daughter  sophia   after the capture we carried the princess and her women to my father  not knowing her to be a daughter of king afridun of constantinople  and he chose out for himself ten including her  and divided the rest among his dependents   presently he set apart five damsels  amongst whom was the king s daughter  and sent them to thy father  king omar bin al nu uman  together with other gifts  such as broadcloth fn 208  and woollen stuffs and grecian silks   thy father accepted them and chose out from amongst the five girls sophia  daughter of king afridun  nor did we hear more of her till the beginning of this year  when her father wrote to my father in words unfitting for me to repeat  rebuking him with menaces and saying to him  two years ago  you plundered a ship of ours which had been seized by a band of frankish pirates in which was my daughter  sophia  attended by her maidens numbering some threescore   yet ye informed me not thereof by messenger or otherwise  nor could i make the matter public  lest reproach befal me amongst the kings  by reason of my daughter s honour   so i concealed my case till this year  when i wrote to certain frankish corsairs and sought news of my daughter from the kings of the isles   they replied   by allah we carried her not forth of thy realm  but we have heard that king hardub rescued her from certain pirates   and they told me the whole tale   then he added in the writing which he writ to my father   except you wish to be at feud with me and design to disgrace me and dishonour my daughter  you will  the instant my letter reacheth you  send my daughter back to me   but if you slight my letter and disobey my commandment  i will assuredly make you full return for your foul dealing and the baseness of your practices   fn 209  when my father read this letter and understood the contents  fn 210  it vexed him and he regretted not having known that sophia  king afridun s daughter  was among the captured damsels  that he might have sent her back to her sire  and he was perplexed about the case because  after so long a time  he could not send to king omar bin al nu uman and demand her back from him  especially as he had lately heard that heaven had granted him boon of babe by this sophia   so when we pondered that truth  we knew that this letter was none other than a grievous calamity  and my father found nothing for it but to write an answer to king afridun  making his excuses and swearing to him by strong oaths that he knew not his daughter to be among the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth how he had sent her to king omar bin al nu uman  who had gotten the blessing of issue by her   when my father s reply reached king afridun he rose up and sat down  fn 211  and roared and foamed at the mouth crying    what  shall he take captive my daughter and even her with slave girls and pass her on from hand to hand sending her for a gift to kings  and they lie with her without marriage contract   by the messiah and the true faith   said he   i will not desist till i have taken my blood vengeance for this and have wiped out my shame  and indeed i will do a deed which the chroniclers shall chronicle after me   so he bided his time till he devised a device and laid notable toils and snares  when he sent an embassy to thy father  king omar  to tell him that which thou hast heard  accordingly thy father equipped thee and an army with thee and sent thee to king afridun  whose object is to seize thee and thine army to boot   as for the three jewels whereof he told thy father when asking his aid  there was not one soothfast word in that matter  for they were with sophia  his daughter  and my father took them from her  when he got possession of her and of her maidens  and gave them to me in free gift  and they are now with me   so go thou to thy host and turn them back ere they be led deep into  and shut in by  the land of the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth the franks and the country of the greeks  for as soon as you have come far enough into their interior  they will stop the roads upon you and there will be no escape for you till the day of retribution and retaliation   i know that thy troops are still halting where thou leftest them  because thou didst order a three days  rest  withal they have missed thee all this time and they wot not what to do   when sharrkan heard her words  he was absent awhile in thought  then he kissed princess abrizah s hand and said   praise be to allah who hath bestowed thee on me and appointed thee to be the cause of my salvation and the salvation of whoso is with me   but  tis grievous to me to part from thee and i know not what will become of thee after my departure    go now to thine army   she replied   and turn them back  while ye are yet near your own country   if the envoys be still with them  lay hands on them and keep them  that the case may be made manifest to you  and  after three days  i will be with you all and we will enter baghdad together   as he turned to depart she said   forget not the compact which is between me and thee   then she rose to bid fn 212  him farewell and embrace him and quench the fire of desire  so she took leave of him and  throwing her arms round his neck  wept with exceeding weeping  and repeated these verses    i bade adieu  my right hand wiped my tears away    the while my      left hand held her in a close embrace   fearest thou naught   quoth she   of shame    i answered  nay         the lover s parting day is lover s worst disgrace     then sharrkan left her and walked down from the convent   they brought his steed  so he mounted and rode down stream to the drawbridge which he crossed and presently threaded the woodland paths and passed into the open meadow   as soon as he was clear of the trees he was aware of horsemen which made him stand on the alert  and he bared his brand and rode cautiously  but as they drew near and exchanged curious looks he recognized them and behold  it was the wazir dandan and two of his emirs   when they saw him and knew him  they dismounted and saluting him  asked the reason of his absence  whereupon he told them all that had passed between him and princess abrizah from first to last   the wazir returned thanks to almighty allah for his safety and said  fn 213   let us at once leave these lands  for the envoys who came with us are gone to inform the king of our approach  and haply he will hasten to fall on us and take us prisoners   so sharrkan cried to his men to saddle and mount  which they did and  setting out at once  they stinted not faring till they reached the sole of the valley wherein the host lay   the ambassadors meanwhile had reported sharrkan s approach to their king  who forthright equipped a host to lay hold of him and those with him   but sharrkan  escorted by the wazir dandan and the two emirs  had no sooner sighted the army  than he raised the cry  march   march   they took horse on the instant and fared through the first day and second and third day  nor did they cease faring for five days  at the end of which time they alighted in a well wooded valley  where they rested awhile   then they again set out and stayed not riding for five and twenty days which placed them on the frontiers of their own country   here  deeming themselves safe  they halted to rest  and the country people came out to them with guest gifts for the men and provender and forage for the beasts   they tarried there two days after which  as all would be making for their homes  sharrkan put the wazir dandan in command  bidding him lead the host back to baghdad   but he himself remained behind with an hundred riders  till the rest of the army had made one day s march  then he called  to horse   and mounted with his hundred men   they rode on two parasangs  fn 214  space till they arrived at a gorge between two mountains and lo   there arose before them a dark cloud of sand and dust   so they checked their steeds awhile till the dust opened and lifted  discovering beneath it an hundred cavaliers  lion faced and in mail coats cased   as soon as they drew within earshot of sharrkan and his meiny they cried out to them  saying   by the virtue of john and mary  we have won to our wish   we have been following you by forced marches  night and day  till we forewent you to this place   so dismount and lay down your arms and yield yourselves  that we may grant you your lives   when sharrkan heard this  his eyes stood out from his head and his cheeks flushed red and he said  how is it  o   nazarene dogs  ye dare enter our country and overmatch our land   and doth not this suffice you  but ye must adventure yourselves and address us in such unseemly speech   do you think to escape out of our hands and return to your country   then he shouted to his hundred horsemen   up and at these hounds  for they even you in number   so saying  he bared his sabre and bore down on them  he and his  but the franks met them with hearts firmer than rocks  and wight dashed against wight  and knight dashed upon knight  and hot waxed the fight  and sore was the affright  and nor parley nor cries of quarter helped their plight  and they stinted not to charge and to smite  right hand meeting right  nor to hack and hew with blades bright white  till day turned to night and gloom oppressed the sight   then they drew apart and sharrkan mustered his men and found none wounded save four only  who showed hurts but not death hurts   said he to them   by allah  my life long have i waded in the clashing sea of fight and i have met many a gallant sprite  but none so unfrightened of the sword that smites and the shock of men that affrights like these valiant knights    know  o king   said they  that there is among them a frankish cavalier who is their leader and  indeed  he is a man of valour and fatal is his spear thrust  but  by allah  he spares us great and small  for whoso falls into his hands he lets him go and forbears to slay him   by allah  had he willed he had killed us all   sharrkan was astounded when he heard what the knight had done and such high report of him  so he said   when the morn shall morrow  we will draw out and defy them  for we are an hundred to their hundred  and we will seek aid against them from the lord of the heavens   so they rested that night in such intent  whilst the franks gathered round their captain and said   verily this day we did not win our will of these   and he replied   at early dawn when the morrow shall morn  we will draw out and challenge them  one after one   they also rested in that mind  and both camps kept guard until almighty allah sent the light of day dawn   thereupon king sharrkan and his hundred riders took horse and rode forth to the plain  where they found the franks ranged in line of battle  and sharrkan said to his followers   our foes have determined like ourselves to do their devoir  so up and at them and lay on load   then came forth an herald of the franks and cried out  saying   let there be no general engagement betwixt us this day  save by the duello  a champion of yours against a champion of ours   whereupon one of sharrkan s riders dashed out from the ranks and crave between the two lines crying   ho   who is for smiting   let no dastard engage me this day nor niderling   hardly had he made an end of his vaunt  when there sallied forth to him a frankish cavalier  armed cap a pie and clad in a surcoat of gold stuff  riding on a grey white steed  fn 215  and he had no hair on his cheeks   he urged his charger on to the midst of the battle plain and the two fell to derring do of cut and thrust  but it was not long before the frank foined the moslem with the lance point  and  toppling him from his steed  took him prisoner and led him off crestfallen   his folk rejoiced in their comrade and  forbidding him to go out again to the field  sent forth another  to whom sallied out another moslem  brother to the captive  and offered him battle   the two fell to  either against other  and fought for a little while  till the frank bore down upon the moslem and  falsing him with a feint  tumbled him by a thrust of the lance heel from his destrier and took him prisoner   after this fashion the moslems ceased not dashing forwards  one after one  and the franks to unhorse them and take them captive  till day departed and the night with darkness upstarted   now they had captured of the moslems twenty cavaliers  and when sharrken saw this  it was grievous to him and he mustered his men and said to them   what is this thing that hath befallen us   to  morrow  i myself will go forth to the field and offer singular combat to their chief and learn what is the cause of his entering our land and warn him against doing battle with our band   if he persist  we will punish him with death  and if he prove peaceable we will make peace with him   they righted on this wise till allah almighty caused the morn to dawn  when mounted the twain and drew up for battle fain  and sharrkan was going forth to the plain  but behold  more than one half of the franks dismounted and remained on foot before one of them who was mounted  till they reached the midst of the battle plain   sharrken looked at that horseman and lo   he was their chief   he was clad in a surcoat of blue satin and a close ringed mail shirt  his face was as the moon when it rises and no hair was upon his cheeks   he hent in hand an indian scymitar and he rode a sable steed with a white blaze on brow  like a dirham  and he smote the horse with heel till he stood almost in the midst of the field when  signing to the moslems  he cried out in fluent arab speech  ho  sharrkan   ho  son of omar bin al  nu uman   ho  thou who forcest fortalice and overthrowest cities and countries   up and out to battle bout  and blade single handed wield with one who halves with thee the field   thou art prince of thy people and i am prince of mine  and whoso overcometh his adversary  him let the other s men obey and come under his sway   hardly had he ended his speech  when out came sharrkan with a heart full of fury  and urging his steed into the midst of the field  closed like a raging lion with the frank who encountered him with wariness and steadfastness and met him with the meeting of warriors   then they fell to foining and hewing  and they stinted not of onset and offset  and give and take  as they were two mountains clashing together or two seas together dashing  nor did they cease fighting until day darkened and night starkened   then they drew apart and each returned to his own party  but as soon as sharrkan foregathered with his comrades  he said   never looked i on the like of this cavalier  he hath one quality i have not yet seen in any and this it is that  when his foemen uncovereth a place for the death blow  he reverseth his weapon and smiteth with the lance heel   in very deed i know not what will be the issue  twixt him and me  but  tis my wish that we had in our host his like and the like of his men   then he went to his rest for the night and  when morning dawned  the frank came forth and rode down to the mid field  where sharrkan met him  and they fell to fighting and to wheeling  left and right  and necks were stretched out to see the sight  nor did they stint from strife and sword play and lunge of lance with main and might  till the day turned to night and darkness overwhelmed the light   then the twain drew asunder and returned each to his own camp  where both related to their comrades what had befallen them in the duello  and at last the frank said to his men   tomorrow shall decide the matter   so they both passed that night restfully till dawn  and  as soon as it was day  they mounted and each bore down on other and ceased not to fight till half the day was done   then the frank bethought him of a ruse  first urging his steed with heel and then checking him with the rein  so that he stumbled and fell with his rider  thereupon sharrkan threw himself on the foe  and would have smitten him with the sword fearing lest the strife be prolonged  when the frank cried out to him   o sharrkan  champions are not wont to do thus   this is the act of a man accustomed to be beaten by a woman   fn 216  when sharrkan heard this  he raised his eyes to the frank s face and gazing steadfastly at him  recognized in him princess abrizah with whom that pleasant adventure had befallen him in the convent  whereupon he cast brand from hand and  kissing the earth before her  asked her   what moved thee to a deed like this    and she answered   i desired to prove thy prowess afield and test thy doughtiness in tilting and jousting   these that are with me are my handmaids  and they are all clean maids  yet they have vanquished thy horsemen in fair press and stress of plain  and had not my steed stumbled with me  thou shouldst have seen my might and prowess in combat   sharrkan smiled at her speech and said   praise be to allah for safety and for my reunion with thee  o queen of the age   then she cried out to her damsels to loose the twenty captives of sharrkan s troop and dismount   they did as she bade and came and kissed the earth before her and sharrkan who said to them   it is the like of you that kings keep in store for the need hour   then he signed to his comrades to salute the princess  so all alighted and kissed the earth before her  for they knew the story   after this  the whole two hundred took horse  and fared on night and day for six days  space  till they drew near to baghdad  when they halted and sharrkan bade abrizah and her handmaids doff the frankish garb that was on them   and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say                  when it was the fifty first night   she said  it hath reached me  o auspicious king  that sharrkan bade princess abrizah and her damsels doff the garb that was on them and don the garments of daughters of greece  and thus did they   then he despatched a company of his companions to baghdad to acquaint his father omar bin al nu uman  with his arrival and report that he was accompanied by princess abrizah  daughter of king hardub  lord of graecia land   they halted forthright in the place they had reached  and sharrkan also halted and all righted there  and when almighty allah made morning dawn  sharrkan and his company and abrizah and her company took horse and fared on towards the city  when lo   on the way they met the wazir dandan  who had come out amongst a thousand horse to honour abrizah and sharrkan  by especial commandment of king omar son of al  nu uman   when the two drew near  they turned towards them and kissed ground before them  then they mounted again and escorted them into the city and went up with them to the palace   sharrkan walked in to his father  who rose and embraced him and questioned him of his case   so he told him all that abrizah had told him  and what had passed between them and said   she hath parted from her sire and departed from her reign and hath chosen to take part with us and make her abode with us  and indeed   he said to his father   the king of constantinople hath plotted to do us a mischief  because of his daughter sophia  for that the king of greece had made known to him her story and the cause of her being given to thee  and he  the grecian king  not knowing her to be daughter of king afridun  lord of constantinople  and  had he known that  he would not have bestowed her upon thee  but he would have restored her to her parent   and of a verity   he continued   we were saved from these perils only by the lady abrizah  and never saw we a more valiant than she   and he went on to tell his father all that had passed from first to last of the wrestling and the single fighting   when king omar heard the story of sharrkan  abrizah was exalted in his eyes  and he longed to see her and question her   thereupon sharrkan went out to her and said   the king calleth for thee   she replied   i hear and i obey   and he took her and brought her in to his father  who was seated on his throne and who  having dismissed his high officers  was attended only by his eunuchs   the princess entered and kissing the ground between his hands  saluted him in choice terms   he was amazed at her eloquent speech and thanked her for her dealing with his son sharrkan and bade her be seated   so she sat down and unveiled her face  fn 217  and  when the king saw her beauty  his reason fled his head and he made her draw near and showed her favour  appointing her an especial palace for herself and her damsels  and assigning them solde and allowances   then began he to ask her of the three jewels aforesaid  and she answered   here be they with me  o king of the age   so saying  she rose and going to her lodging  unpacked her baggage and from it brought out a box and from the box a casket of gold   she opened the casket and taking out those three jewels  kissed them and gave them to the king   then she went away bearing his heart with her   after her going the king sent for his son sharrkan and gave him one jewel of the three  and when he enquired of the other two replied   o my son   i mean to give one to thy brother zau al makan  and the other to thy sister nuzhat al  zaman   but when sharrkan heard that he had a brother  for to that time he knew only of his sister  he turned to his sire and said to him   o king  hast thou a son other than myself   he answered   yes  and he is now six years old   adding that his name was zau al  makan and that he and nuzhat al zaman were twins  born at a birth   this news was grievous to sharrkan  but he kept his secret and said   the bless  ing of allah most high be upon them    and he cast the jewel from his hand and shook the dust off his clothes   quoth the king   how do i see thee change thy manner when hearing of this  considering that after me thou becomes  heir of the kingdom   of a truth the troops have sworn to thee and the emirs and grandees have taken the oath of succession to thee  and this one of the three jewels is thine   sharrkan bowed his head to the ground and was ashamed to bandy words with his parent so he accepted the jewel and went away  knowing not what to do for exceeding wrath  and stayed not walking till he had entered abrizah s palace   as he approached she stood up to meet him and thanked him for what he had done and prayed for blessings on him and his sire   then she sat down and seated him by her side  but when he had taken his place she saw rage in his face and questioned him  whereupon he told her that allah had blessed his father with two children by sophia  a boy and a girl  and that he had named the boy zau al makan and the girl nuzhat al zaman  adding   he hath kept the other two jewels for them and hath given me one of thine  so i left it behind  i knew naught of zau al makan s birth till this day  and the twain are now six years old   so when i learnt this  wrath possessed me  and i tell thee the reason of my rage and hide nothing from thee   but now i fear lest my father take thee to wife  for he loveth thee and i saw in him signs of desire for thee  so what wilt thou say  if he wish this   quoth she   know  o sharrkan  that thy father hath no dominion over me  nor can he have me without my consent  and if he prevail over me by force  i will take my own life   as for the three jewels  it was not my intent that he should give any of them to either of his children and i had no thought but that he would lay them up in his treasury with his things of price  but now i desire of thy favour that thou make me a present of the jewel which he gave thee  if thou have accepted it    hearkening and obedience   replied sharrkan  and gave it to her   then said she   fear nothing   and talked with him awhile and continued   i fear lest my father hear that i am with you and sit not patiently under my loss  but do his endeavours to find me  and to that end he may ally himself with king afridun  on account of his daughter sophia  and both come on thee with armies and so there befal great turmoil   when sharrken heard these words  he said to her   o my lady  if it please thee to sojourn with us  take no thought of them  though there gather together against us all that be on land and on sea      tis well   rejoined she   if ye entreat me fair  i will tarry with you  and if ye deal evilly by me  i will depart from you   then she bade her slave maidens bring food  so they set the tables  and sharrkan ate a little and went away to his own house  disturbed and perturbed   such was his case  but regarding the affairs of his father  omar bin al nu uman  after dismissing his son sharrkan he arose and  taking the other two jewels  betook himself to the lady sophia  who stood up when she saw him and remained standing till he was seated   presently  his two children  zau al makan and nuzhat al zaman  came to him and he kissed them and hung a jewel round each one s neck  at which they rejoiced and kissed his hands   then went they to their mother  who joyed in their joy and wished the king long life  so he asked her   why hast thou not informed me all this time that thou art the daughter of king afridun  lord of constantinople  that i might have honoured thee still more and enlarged thee in dignity and raised thy rank    o king   answered sophia   and what could i desire greater or higher than this my standing with thee  overwhelmed as i am with thy favours and thy benefits   and  furthermore  allah hath blessed me with two children by thee  a son and a daughter   her reply pleased the king and after leaving her  he set apart for her and her children a wondrous fine palace   moreover  he appointed for them eunuchs and attendants and doctors of law and doctors of philosophy and astrologers and physicians and surgeons to do them service  and in every way he redoubled his favour and entreated them with the best of treatment   and presently he returned to the palace of his dominion and to his court where he distributed justice among the lieges   so far concerning him and sophia and her children  but in the matter of abrizah the king was greatly occupied with love of her and burnt with desire of her night and day  and every night  he would go in to her and converse with her and pay his court to her  but she gave him no answer  only saying   o king of the age   i have no desire for men at this present   when he saw her withdraw from him  his passion waxed hotter and his longing and pining increased until  when weary of this  he summoned his wazir dandan and  opening his very heart to him  told him of his love for princess abrizah  daughter of hardub  and informed him how she refused to yield to his wishes and how desire for her was doing him to die  for that he could get no grace of her   the wazir  hearing these words  said to the king   as soon as it is dark night  take thou a piece of bhang the measure of a miskal  about an ounce  and go in to her and drink somewhat of wine with her   when the hour of ending the carousel shall draw near  fill her a last cup and dropping therein the bhang  give it to her to drink  and she will not reach her sleeping chamber ere the drug take effect on her   then do thou go in to her and take thy will of her  and such is my advice   fn 218   thy rede is aright   quoth the king  and seeking his treasury  he took thence a piece of concentrated bhang  if an elephant smelt it he would sleep from year to year   this he put in his bosom pocket and waited till some little of the night went by  when he betook himself to the palace of princess abrizah  who seeing him stood up to receive him  but he bade her sit down   so she sat down  and he sat by her  and he began to talk with her of wine and wassail  whereupon she furnished the carousing table fn 219  and placed it before him   then she set on the drinking vessels and lighted the candles and ordered to bring dried fruits and sweet meats and all that pertaineth to drinking   so they fell to tippling and the king ceased not to pledge her till drunkenness crept into her head  and seeing this he took out the bit of bhang from his pocket and  holding it between his fingers  filled a cup with his own hand and drank it off   then filling a second he said   to thy companionship    and dropped the drug into her cup  she knowing naught of it   she took it and drank it off  then she rose and went to her sleeping chamber   he waited for less than an hour till he was assured that the dose had taken effect on her and had robbed her of her senses  when he went in to her and found her thrown on her back  and she had doffed her petticoat trousers and the air raised the skirt of her shift and discovered what was between her thighs   when the king saw the state of things and found a lighted candle at her head and another at her feet  shining upon what her thighs enshrined he took leave of his five senses for lust and satan seduced him and he could not master himself  but put off his trousers and fell upon her and abated her maiden head   then he rose off her and went to one of her women  by name marjanah  and said   go in to thy lady and speak with her   so she went in to her mistress and found her lying on her back insensible  with the blood running down to the calves of her legs  whereupon she took a kerchief and wiped away the blood and lay by her that night   as soon as almighty allah brought the dawn  the handmaid marjanah washed her mistress s hands and feet and brought rose water and bathed her face and mouth with it  where upon she sneezed and yawned and cast up from her inside that bit of bhang like a bolus  fn 220  then she revived and washed her hands and mouth and said to marjanah   tell me what hath befallen me   so she told her what had passed and how she had found her  lying on her back  with the blood running down  wherefore she knew that king omar bin al nu uman had lain with her and had undone her and taken his will of her   at this she grieved with exceeding grief and retired into privacy  saying to her damsels   deny me to whoso would come in to me and say to him that i am ill  till i see what allah will do with me   presently the news of her sickness came to the king  so he sent her sherbets and sugar electuaries   some months she thus passed in solitude  during which time the king s flame cooled and his desire for her was quenched  so that he abstained from her   now she had conceived by him  and when the months of child breeding had gone by  her pregnancy appeared and her belly swelled  and the world was straitened upon her  so she said to her handmaid marjanah   know that it is not the folk who have wronged me  but i who sinned against my own self fn 221  in that i left my father and mother and country   indeed  i abhor life  for my spirit is broken and neither courage nor strength is left me   i used  when i mounted my steed  to have the mastery of him  but now i am unable to ride   if i be brought to bed among them i shall be dishonoured before my hand women and every one in the palace will know that he hath taken my maidenhead in the way of shame  and if i return to my father  with what face shall i meet him or with what face shall i have recourse to him   how well quoth the poet    say  what shall solace one who hath nor home nor stable stead        nor cup companion  nor a cup  nor place to house his head     marjanah answered her   it is thine to command  i will obey   and abrizah said   i desire at once to leave this place secretly  so that none shall know of me but thou  and return to my father and my mother  for when flesh stinketh  there is naught for it but its own folk and allah shall do with me e en as he will    o princess   marjanah replied   what thou wouldest do is well   then she made matters ready and kept her secret and waited for some days till the king went out to chase and hunt  and his son sharrkan betook himself to certain of the fortresses to sojourn there awhile   then said she to marjanah   i wish to set out this night  but how shall i do against my destiny   for already i feel the pangs of labour and child birth  and if i abide other four or five days  i shall be brought to bed here  and i shall be unable to travel to my country   but this is what was written on my forehead   then she considered awhile  and said to marjanah   look us out a man who will go with us and serve us by the way  for i have no strength to bear arms    by allah  o my lady   replied marjanah   i know none but a black slave called al  ghazban  fn 222  who is one of the slaves of king omar bin al  nu uman  he is a valiant wight  and he keepeth guard at our palace gate   the king appointed him to attend us  and indeed we have overwhelmed him with our favours  so  lookye  i will go out and speak with him of this matter  and promise him some monies and tell him that  if he have a mind to tarry with us  i will marry him to whom he will   he told me before to day that he had been a highwayman  so if he consent to us we shall win our wish and reach to our own land   she rejoined   call him that i may talk with him   whereupon marjanah fared forth and said to the slave   o ghazban  allah prosper thee  so thou fall in with what my lady saith to thee   then she took him by the hand and brought him to the princess  whose hands he kissed but as she beheld him  her heart took fright at him    how ever   she said to herself   of a truth  need giveth the law   and she approached to speak with him  yet her heart started away from him   presently she said   o ghazban  say me  wilt thou help me against the perfidies of fortune and conceal my secret if i discover it to thee   when the slave saw her  his heart was taken by storm and he fell in love with her forthright and could not but reply   o my mistress  whatsoever thou biddest me do  i will not depart therefrom   quoth she   i would have thee take me at this hour and take this my handmaid and saddle us two camels and two of the king s horses and set on each horse a saddle bag of goods and somewhat of provaunt  and go with us to our own country  where  if thou desire to abide with us  i will marry thee to her thou shalt choose of my handmaidens  or  if thou prefer return to thine own land  we will marry thee and give thee whatso thou desires  after thou hast taken of money what shall satisfy thee   when al ghazban  heard this  he rejoiced with great joy and replied   o my lady  i will serve both of you with mine eyes and will go at once and saddle the horses   then he went away gladsome and saying to himself   i shall get my will of them and if they will not yield to me  i will kill them both and take their riches   but he kept this his intent to himself  and presently returned with two camels and three head of horses  one of which he rode  and princess abrizah made marjanah mount the second she mounting the third  albeit she was in labour pains and possessed not her soul for anguish   and the slave ceased not travelling with them night and day through the passes of the mountains  till there remained but musingly march between them and their own country  when the travail pangs came upon abrizah and she could no longer resist  so she said to al ghazban   set me down  for the pains of labour are upon me   and cried to marjanah   do thou alight and sit by me and deliver me   then marjanah dismounted from her horse  and al ghazban did in like sort  and they made fast the bridles and helped the princess to dismount  for she was aswoon from excess of anguish   when al ghazban saw her on the ground
